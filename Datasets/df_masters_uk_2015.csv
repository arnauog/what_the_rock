In early 2006 she became engaged to [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Howard+Willing]Howard Willing[/url], the producer of her [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/513197]Fires[/url] album.

She is a British recording artist who grew up in Jersey. She released her debut album on Polydor records, Dear Frustrated Superstar, in 2001. This spawned two commercial singles, ""Patience"" and ""Alien"", with a third single, ""If I Know You"" mooted, a video for which was filmed, but has never been publicly shown. Her album was withdrawn during an arena tour with Bryan Adams, and was never re-issued.

Subsequently she was dropped from the label partly as a result of a message she wrote on the Tipsheet message board relating to remixes of ""Photograph"", a track that was intended to be on the re-issued Dear Frustrated Superstar. This incident and many others related to the industry and her experiences with her debut album are discussed in stories on her official web site.

Pallot met fellow Jersey resident and Grammy Award-nominated record producer Andy Chatterley in January 2007. They became engaged within the first half hour of their first date, and married six weeks later on 14 February 2007. The story was told by Pallot on Janice Long's BBC Radio 2 show on 3 June 2009. Pallot recently completed her degree in English Literature at Birkbeck, University of London. The couple moved to London but in the late 2010s they moved out to a more rural part of England.
On 9th Sept, 2010, Nerina announced via Twitter: ""@Andy_Chatterley and I are proud to present our finest song. Our son,Wolfie Chatterley, born this morning"". The child's full name is Wolfgang Amadeus Chatterley.
On 1st July, 2012, whilst performing at Cornbury Festival, Pallot revealed that she is an Arsenal F.C. fan.

Can are well-known as one of the key pioneers of Krautrock, particularly during the era when fronted by Japanese singer Kenji ""Damo"" Suzuki who ""turned their sound towards a crazy mixture of improvisation, noise, mantra and funk rhythms"". They were constantly at the forefront of the Krautrock scene during their 10+ year history, composed music for films by directors including Roland Klick and Wim Wenders, and had an international hit with their pop satire single ""I Want More"" (1976).

The first Can member to go solo was Holger Czukay, and after Can split keyboard player Irmin Schmidt established a successful solo career. Other Can members also went solo and/or participated in other projects. In 1986 Czukay, Karoli, Mooney, Schmidt, and Liebezeit reformed, resulting in the album ""[m=16239]"" (1989). In March 2003 Can received the German music industry's Echo Award for lifetime achievement.

Posthumously for some members, Can continue to inspire today and are blessed with a huge collection of tape recordings that have not seen the light of day. The Lost Tapes is part of this legacy, released in 2012, also known as Holger Czukay's pension fund. A new series is taking shape in the form of live recordings by long standing Can fans that shows the depth and wealth of the bands musical resolve.

Shortly after, Ollie Isaac, previously of Ossiyan, was recruited and the wall of sound could be finished.

Each new member brought a different perspective to the semi crafted tracks, and it wasn’t long before the band were ready to commit their music to tape. After just six short weeks of rehearsal they embarked on a three day session with Sam Thredder (Slabdragger) at his Cro’s Nest Studio, to create the debut EP “From the Ghost Grey Depths”. Clocking in at 50 mins and consisting of four brooding tracks which, on the surface, seem to explore the world of myth and folklore, “From the Ghost Grey Depths” is a contemplation of the dread and torments of life, modern relationships and the power hungry society we live in."

For Nordic Giants the performance is the thing, and as those who have seen the live show will attest, it is a visceral experience that goes beyond the normal descriptors. Each mind-blowing performance involves a chosen few short films, which are soundtracked live with atmospheric soundscapes.

“Air whistles and whines around my ears, Distant echoes drift through endless minds, And magnetised to empty thoughts” 
Largely instrumental, A Séance Of Dark Delusions reflects the inspired musical experimentation and atmosphere of SigurRós, 65daysofstatic, Bjork and Pink Floyd. Nordic Giants bring a heavy orchestral brutality through progressive guitar, drum and brass, which are paired with beautiful and haunting electronics as they warp loops and end of the world samples through pattered keys.
“The hollow sound resonates from morbid tone, And aloft the music goes, Notes bend and warp as the swell rolls” 
When they pull lyricism from the human world, Nordic Giants enlist the vocal features of artists, Saturday Sun (‘Dissolve’), Nadine Wild Palmer (‘Futures Dark’), Freyja (‘Give Flight To The Imagination’), and Beth Cannon (‘Rapture’). 
“Unborn thoughts sleep silently in the mind, A heavy cushion of warm unblemished noise, The heart beats slowly in time with the dull thud of drum”

Their first releases on their own [l16961] label, especially ""Seduction"", did well in the UK independent charts, and they were signed by [l362], hoping for greater commercial success.  
The original line-up included Paul Gilmartin (drums), Paul Nash (guitar), Steve Rawlings (voice), Lyndon Scarfe (keyboards), and Tim Wright (bass).  After their 1983 album [i]Heaven Is Waiting[/i], Scarfe left and was replaced by David Whitaker (formerly with [a210939]).  The band released two more singles on Arista - ""Say It Again"" (produced by [a20942]) and ""Hold On"" (produced by [a41642]) - and plans were announced for an album of older tracks ('Heaven Again') re-recorded in a more danceable, radio-friendly fashion, which never came to fruition.  Instead, the band left Arista and demoed new songs, which were released in 1986 as their final album, [i]Looking Through[/i], once again on their own label.  
Steve Rawlings started [a40935], while the other band members continued for some time as Johnny in the Clouds, which never released any recordings.

At the end of 2009, Paul Gilmartin, Paul Nash, and David Whitaker met up for the first time in 24 years and decided to reform the band; initially, Steve Rawlings also agreed to rejoin the band.  Over the next nine months, instrumental tracks were recorded, and in October 2010, Rawlings briefly met with the band in the UK, but returned to America after recording just one vocal track.  Plans changed when, after that initial meeting, the band lost contact with Rawlings.  In January 2011, vocalist Maethelyiah (of [a520865])  recorded vocals for all thirteen tracks, and the official news of her joining the band was revealed the following May with the release of the reformation album [i]Change of Skin[/i].  
Bassist Martin Roberts joined the band before the release of [i]Scarey Tales[/i] in February 2013.  A year later, the band issued a statement that Gilmartin and Roberts had unexpectedly resigned from the band, resulting in the cancellation of a series of tour dates and Paul Nash being the sole founding member keeping the rights to the band name. David Whittaker had already left after the release.
The remaining band carried on without them, recruiting Iain Hunter (drums) and Jack Cooper (bass).  Their sixth studio album, [i]VI[/i], was released in September 2015.  Hunter was replaced by Josh Rylance, and the EP [i]FUTUR1ST[/i] was released in 2018.  Rylance was then replaced by Tom Davenport. The seventh studio album [i]Sailing Mirrors[/i] was released in Sept 2020, and a retrospective A-Z anthology [i]40 years of Danse[/i] was released in November 2020 along with unearthed and restored early live concert recordings and new remasters of the first three Albums..

The other members are Mick Anker on bass guitar, Neville Henry on saxophone, and Tony Kiley on drums (born February 16, 1962). 
In 1984 the group released their debut album Limping for a Generation, but their first hit single came in 1986 with ""Digging Your Scene,"" from their second album Animal Magic (which reached number 21 in the UK Albums Chart).
The single attracted attention for its topical lyrics, dealing with the AIDS-fueled backlash against gay people, it peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number 7 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. In addition, it reached a high of No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 24 in Italy, and No. 25 in Germany.
In January 1987 their third album She Was Only a Grocer's Daughter (whose title is a reference to then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher), was released; it reached No. 20 in the UK, thanks to its biggest hit, ""It Doesn't Have to Be This Way,"" which reached No. 5 in the UK and number 28 in Italy. Although it was released in the United States, it didn't chart there. It is featured in the movie Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol. The song ""You Don't Own Me"" appears on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. The record also featured harmony vocals by singer-songwriter Grayson Hugh. 
Outside the group (though actually included on their fourth album, Whoops! There Goes the Neighbourhood), a successful single release by Robert Howard was ""Wait,"" which featured early Chicago House diva Kym Mazelle on female lead vocals. The record was an early British recording in the subgenre dubbed UK Garage, it reached number 7 on the UK chart. 
It would later re-appear on the Blow Monkeys' first greatest-hits album Choices – The Singles Collection, their highest-charting record, reaching No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart in 1989.
The band split up in late 1990,shortly after the release of their fifth album Springtime for the World (an EP of the same name was also released, collecting all three singles from the album). 
After briefly recording with Dee C. Lee as Slam Slam, Dr. Robert went solo. 
He contributed to Paul Weller's solo debut album, and co-wrote material with both Weller and Lee. Another notable collaborator was Beth Orton.
On 18 November 2007, the original band members announced the reunion of the Blow Monkeys, as well as a new album Devil's Tavern, and a tour in 2008. 
Released on 8 September 2008, the album was funded by the pre-orders placed by fans. Q magazine reviewed the album, saying, ""Their first album in 18 years still finds the frontman in fine voice; Robert continues to sound like he dresses only in velvet and smokes cigarillos.""
In June 2009 the band released a special-edition double digipack CD and DVD of their performance at the 100 Club in London. It featured the original line-up performing fifteen songs including ""Digging Your Scene,"" ""It Doesn't Have to Be This Way,"" and ""Wait,"" other tracks from the band's earlier work, along with a few new songs from Devil's Tavern.
January 2011 saw the release of the album Staring at the Sea, with ""Steppin' Down"" as the first single issued.
Feels Like a New Morning was released by Cherry Red Records in April 2013, accompanied by a bonus CD containing 10 Blow Monkeys songs performed by Dr. Robert.
In 2013 Sony Music issued a comprehensive three-disc box set, Halfway to Heaven: The Best of The Blow Monkeys & Dr Robert, including a 1984 concert from the Hammersmith Palais.
In October 2014 the band went to Monnow Valley Studios, Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales to record a new album, with Jon Withnall on mixing and engineering duties. 
The resulting album If Not Now, When? was released in April 2015.
In October 2017 the band released their tenth studio album The Wild River on Monks Rd. Records, and it was written and produced by Robert Howard and recorded and mixed at Gismo 7 Studio in Motril, Spain. The album features Crispin Taylor on drums and is a return to their soul/funk roots.
In October 2018 the band supported Level 42 on their Eternity Tour.
On 4 March 2020, the group's Facebook page announced they are heading back to the studio to record their 11th studio album; they also announced a subsequent tour in 2021.
In September 2021 they released the ""Journey To You"" album, produced and written by Dr Robert.

The band’s dark subject matter, literary references (Eldritch’s lyrics nod to anyone from Shelley to [a227848]), cavernous reverb and black record sleeves led the music press to dub them a “goth rock” act, though the band has always rejected this description.

The debut album *[m=2795]* was not released until 1985, and the lineup that recorded it split soon afterwards. To prevent departing members [a257204] and [a164067] from renaming themselves [a115235], Eldritch hurriedly released his own album under this name; Adams and Hussey instead formed [a99925]. Eldritch then rebooted the Sisters as a duo of himself and bassist [a155571]; the 1987 album *[m=2836]* prominently featured synthesizers. In 1990 the Sisters returned to live performance after a five-year absence, promoting a new album, *[m=61848]*, recorded mainly by Eldritch and guitarist [a238296].

With catchy songs full of bright, jangly guitars and clever lyrics about northern life, the band’s 2017 debut album* ‘Northern Powerhouse’* and 2018 follow-up EP ‘Good Morning, Bad Blood’ were both met with rave reviews. Songwriter Joe Hodgson's lyrics are evocative tales of love, loss and life in Northern industrial towns set to jangly, melancholic guitars that have drawn comparisons with a sound similar to The Smiths and The Housemartins. Sepia-tinged yet humorous, they offer an insight into life in a former ship building town.

The group release their eagerly-awaited new album ‘Frame Yourself’ in Spring 2020 and will be taking their new tracks and thrilling live show on the road throughout the year.

Be sure to catch them live at a venue near you.

While living in Japan in 1972, he developed an interest in ethnic music, particularly African styles, and decided to try to merge those styles with more traditional Western sounds. He launched the PCO as an outlet for his compositions with this eclectic hybrid approach. He always said that the ""Penguin Cafe"" concept was one that came to him in a dream while he was suffering from food poisoning in the south of France in the summer of 1972, after which he wrote a poem that began, ""I am the proprietor of the Penguin Cafe, I will tell you things at random."" He described the music of the group as ""modern semi-acoustic chamber music.""

Starting off as a punk-pop band, the band discovered the music of The Jayhawks, The Byrds, Tom Petty and Wilco and their sound gradually matured into more of an alt-country style but without losing the upbeat, catchy melodies of their songs.

Since their self-titled and self-released debut album in 2001, Dropkick have released a further twelves albums and three EPs, had worldwide airplay (including BBC Radio 2, Radio Gothenburg and Onda Madrid), performed live on BBC Children In Need and toured in Spain five times, a country in which they have a significant cult following.

Their 2008 album “Dot The i” (originally released on their own Taylored Records label) was re-issued by Rock Indiana Records in Spain and Dropkick’s albums, ‘Patchwork’, ‘Abelay Hotel’, ‘Time Cuts The Ties’ and ‘Paper Trails’ were released between 2008 and 2012 on Swedish label Sound Asleep Records.

In 2014 Dropkick released two albums: “Homeward”, on Taylored Records and Bobo Integral in Spain, and ‘Good Vibes: The Dropkick Songbook Vol.1’, a retrospective collection of songs from between 2001-2008 released by Rock Indiana Records. These releases were supported with a massively successful tour of Spain and UK shows.

Dropkick’s line-up has changed many times over the years but in early 2015 the band, expanded to a five piece line up the previous year, welcomed Roy W Taylor back into the band after a four year break to replace founding member, Alastair Taylor.

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond. However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG. Phil Mogg and Andy Parker were still members of UFO by 2019, when the band began what they called a farewell tour. Mogg's health issues resulted in UFO cancelling what was planned to be one last tour in 2022, and in April 2024, he confirmed that the band was finished."

Later band members included Neil Finn's brother [a247008], [a437425] and Americans [a418822] and [a847062]. 

Mark Hart who had toured with the group joined as a permanent member in 1993. Founding drummer Hester left in the band in May 1994 citing family reasons. He briefly returned for their ""Farewell to the World"" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996 and also played on three new tracks recorded for the album ""Recurring Dream"" (1996). His replacement was Peter Jones who remained with the group until they disbanded in 1996.

On 26 March 2005, Hester died by suicide. In 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums in 2007 and 2010.

In November 2016 they were inducted into the ARIA (Australian Recording Industry Association) Hall of Fame.

On 9 December 2019, Neil Finn unveiled via his official web site that the band's new line-up - alongside himself and Seymour - would add [a55974], [a592970] and [a842515]. As a result, Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod would no longer participate.

Although other New Zealand solo acts have topped the US charts, the group hold the distinction of being the only New Zealand band to have made it to #2 in the US Billboard Singles chart, with their single ""Don't Dream It's Over""."

However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG.

The group has no permanent group line-up, and Johnson has collaborated with a wide range of musicians, changing personnel from project to project.
The The began recording in 1979/1980 and released their first single “Controversial Subject” in 1980. The first album release came in 1983, the critically acclaimed “Soul Mining"", which featured guest appearances from [a=Orange Juice (3)] drummer [a=Zeke Manyika], [a=Jools Holland], [a=Thomas Leer] and [a15025].
Johnson followed with a new album entitled “Infected” in 1986, recording again with Zeke Manyika, plus singer [a=Neneh Cherry], and a number of session musicians. Four singles were released from the album, with ""Heartland"" being the most successful, reaching 29 in the UK Chart. The album was accompanied by a full length video “Infected: The Movie” which was shot on location in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Johnson toured the world extensively with the movie. 
In 1988, Johnson re-formed The The as a four piece band, having recruited ex-[a=The Smiths] guitarist [a=Johnny Marr], bassist [a=James Eller] and former [a=ABC] drummer [a=David Palmer] as full time band members. This line-up recorded the album “Mind Bomb”, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and featured the band's highest charting single to that time, ""The Beat(en) Generation"" hitting 18 in the UK chart.
In 1989 keyboard player [a=D.C. Collard] was added to the line-up and the band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called “The The Versus The World”, culminating in three sold out gigs at London's Royal Albert Hall at the end of the tour. 
In 1990 the studio EP “Shades of Blue” was released. 
In 1993, the five-piece line-up (Johnson/Marr/Collard/Eller/Palmer) recorded The The’s fourth album “Dusk”, which debuted at No. 2 in the UK. Another world tour followed, the “Lonely Planet” tour. Johnson relocated the band to America, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by guitarist [a=Keith Joyner] and bassist [a=Jared Michael Nickerson]. Harmonica player [a=Jim Fitting] (formerly of [a=Treat Her Right]) joined the band in early 1993. Palmer left the band partway through the tour and was replaced by ex-[a=Stabbing Westward] drummer [a=Andy Kubiszewski]. The reshuffled band headlined the main stage at the 1993 Reading Festival.
Johnson then permanently relocated to New York, and The The's next project was 1995's “Hanky Panky”, an album that consisted entirely of [a=Hank Williams] cover versions. “Hanky Panky” was recorded by a new The The group, this time consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, guitarist [a=Eric Schermerhorn], bass guitarist [a=Gail Ann Dorsey], and drummer [a=Brian MacLeod]. Their cover version of ""I Saw The Light"" hit No. 31 in the UK chart.
In 2000, The The, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, bassist [a=Spencer Campbell] and drummer [a=Earl Harvin], released its sixth album “NakedSelf” and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour, “The Naked Tour”, lasting 14 months. “NakedSelf” remains The The's final released studio album to date.
Since 2003 the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations.
In April 2014 The The announced that on June 30th 2014 a re-mastered, re-packaged version of ""Soul Mining"" would be released to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of its original release.

She's the sister of recording artist [a=Dannii Minogue].

She first came to global attention with her role as Charlene Mitchell in the soap opera ""Neighbours."" She began her music career in 1987 when she signed to Mushroom Records and released a cover-version of Little Eva's ""Locomotion,"" which spent seven weeks as the Australian number one. The success of ""Locomotion,"" lead to Minogue travelling to the UK to record with pop producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman, with whom she worked until 1992. In 1993, she signed with dance label [l=Deconstruction], a move that was marketed as the start of a new phase in her career. The distance from her SAW-managed sugary past was highlighted, and her credibility boosted, in 1995, when she collaborated with Nick Cave on the murder ballad ""Where The Wild Roses Grow.""

After leaving Deconstruction, Minogue signed with Parlophone in April 1999, with whom she released the albums ""Light Years,"" (2000) and ""Fever,"" (2001) both of which proved enormous commercial and critical successes. In 2005, Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer, putting her career on hiatus for 18 months. Following treatment and surgery, she resumed her ""Showgirl Tour,"" in Sydney on 11 November, 2006.  

In 2008, Minogue received an OBE from the Queen of United Kingdom, not long after which she received the French cultural award, the “Chevalier de L’ordre des Arts et Lettres,” insignia (‘Knight’ in the Order of Arts and Letters). Her tenth album ""X,"" (2008) was nominated for Best Dance Album for the 51st Grammy Awards. In 2008 she did a world tour, and in 2009, toured the USA and Canada, exclusively. She released her eleventh studio album ""Aphrodite,"" in 2010, her fifth with Parlophone. Inducted into the ARIA HOF (Hall Of Fame) on the  27th November, 2011.

In March 2012, Minogue began a year-long celebration for her 25 years in the music industry, which was often called ""K25."" The anniversary started with her embarking on the ""Anti Tour,"" in England and Australia, which featured B-sides, demos and rarities from her music catalogue. The tour was positively received for its intimate atmosphere and was a commercial success, grossing over two million dollars from four shows. 

She then released the single ""Timebomb."" in May, her greatest hits compilation album, ""The Best of Kylie Minogue,"" in June and the singles box-set, ""K25 Time Capsule,"" in October. She performed at various events around the world, including Sydney Mardi Gras, Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Concert, and BBC Proms in the Park London 2012. Minogue released the compilation album, ""The Abbey Road Sessions,"" in October. The album contained reworked and orchestral versions of her previous songs. It was recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios and was produced by Steve Anderson and Colin Elliot. The album received favorable reviews from music critics and debuted at number-two in the United Kingdom. The album spawned two singles, ""Flower,"" and ""On A Night Like This."""

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

Philip joined the Pogues to play banjo replacing Jem Finer for a while, but he stayed in the band because Shane didn't want to play guitar anymore.  Chevron has also played with Mary Coughlan and did a solo version of ""Thousands Are Sailing"" for the soundtrack to a BBC documentary about Irish music called ""Bringing It All Back Home"".

First rising to fame as an integral member of the [a325097] in the late 1960s, Stanshall embarked on an idiosyncratic solo career when the Bonzos split up in 1970, astonishing in its variety and fertility but also broken up by long periods of inactivity as a consequence of his problems with alcoholism and depression.

Perhaps his most famous creation was the saga of Rawlinson End, sprawling spoken-word pieces interspersed with original songs. The stories began with a relatively short track on the final Bonzo Dog Band album ‘Let’s Make Up and Be Friendly’ but grew into 20-minute pieces on the [a64672] Show on [l134459], and resultant albums, from 1975 onwards. Depicting a world of English aristocracy that was part [a951168], part [a1481651], they were a showcase for Stanshall’s intricate wordplay and surreal imagination, along with his mellifluous and elastic voice.

Although Stanshall could be notoriously erratic and difficult to work with, he was involved in a number of collaborations with such artists as [a214188], [a17827], [a259772] and [a201571], and also created two solo albums notable for their varied musical styles and lyrics full of his perennial loves of rhyming slang, absurdist puns and tongue-twisters.

After a period of creative resurgence in the late 1980s that saw a number of Rawlinson End sessions for John Peel and a West End staging of his musical play ""Stinkfoot"" (partly financed by [a289153] and [a11136]), Stanshall’s drinking worsened in the 1990s and he perished in a fire at his flat in London on 5 March 1995, probably caused by an overturned lamp as he slept.

He left behind him a small but rich legacy of comic and musical originality, belying his popular image as simply the man who announced the instruments on [a18666]'s album ""Tubular Bells"".

Evolving from Cleveland's Teutonic protopunks, [a252899], Pere Ubu was formed late in 1975 by Thomas (aka Crocus Behemoth) and guitarist Peter Laughner (who died in 1977). Ubu's classic early singles, ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""Final Solution,"" oozed restless angst way before it became the domain of spoiled mallrats. By 1978's aggressive The Modern Dance and the wilder Dub Housing, Pere Ubu's subversions of rock were guided by superior musicianship and fallout from Thomas's Jehovah's Witness upbringing. Personality quirks split the band, and Thomas regrouped for three more self-indulgent albums through 1982, including the abstract stare-down of The Art Of Walking, all with some difficult sonic perversion to recommend them.

After several Ubus found themselves onstage in Thomas's Wooden Birds, the band was revived for 1988's The Tenement Year. With newfound focus, Pere Ubu unleashed the ravishing funhouse pop experiment of 1989's Cloudland, which treated mainstream textures like found sounds. The sparkling pop, dented by Thomas's unique warble, continued with the gently peculiar Worlds In Collision. But Ubu tired of the total pop concept and returned to quirkier pursuits for Story Of My Life. Tim Kerr Records picked up the ball with 1995's full-bodied Ray Gun Suitcase--a mix of Ubu's vicious rock, luscious pop and art-damaged identities--and a series of multimedia-enhanced EPs, for which Thomas programmed the codes."

Though most of their debut ""Fool's Game"" was standard Thrash Metal (with the exception of ""Every Day's A Holiday"" and a cover of Rick James' ""Superfreak""), the follow-up ""In This Life"" was where band's influences (aided by the rap-style turntables of Aaron Vaughn) really come to the fore, giving the album and band a very distinctive style. By the time of ""Visions"" (1992), internal friction within the band had developed, leading to the departure of longtime vocalist Scott Holderby. With new vocalist Paul Kimball, the band released ""The Next Room"" (1994), after which they parted ways. After years of silence, Holderby and most of the core members reunited in late 2001 to play some shows and pursue a renewed career. Following their last show in late March of 2002, the band announced that they would be changing their name and drastically changing their style as well.

Self description of the project:
""In East Germany in the early 1970’s Martin Zeichnete worked as a sound editor for DEFA, (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), the state-owned film studio. Like many young East Germans of the time he would listen furtively to West German radio at night and became infatuated with the Kosmische Musik or ‘Krautrock’ epitomised by the likes of Kraftwerk, Neu! and Cluster emerging from his neighbouring country. Martin, a keen runner, hit upon the idea of using the repetitive, motorik beats of this new music as a training aid for athletes. He thought it could benefit the mind as well as the body with the pulsing, hypnotic music bringing focus. A ‘borrowed’ prototype of Andreas Pavel’s Stereobelt showed Martin the technology to provide music on the move already existed and could easily be adapted for runners.

After sharing his concept with colleagues Martin was taken from his studio to East Berlin, quizzed by the authorities about his ideas and, fearing the worst, was surprised to find himself put to work by the Nationales Olympisches Komitee immediately. Installed in a cold Berlin studio with the few electronic instruments the state could supply, (Martin asked for a Moog but was refused), he began one of the strangest journeys in music. Known to the government as State Plan 14.84L, Martin and his fellow musicians informally called it ‘Projekt Kosmischer Läufer’ (Cosmic Runner).

For the next 11 years Martin would be spirited to Berlin to work on tracks with little notice. He created hours of music fusing traditional rock instruments with synthesizers, early drum computers, tape slicing and looping techniques he and his engineer formulated themselves. His output included tracks for running at various paces, warm up pieces, ‘ambient’ music to play in gyms during training and pieces for artistic gymnastic routines.""

This is widely believed to be an elaborate hoax with a lot of manufactured evidence of the existence of [a=Martin Zeichnete]. There were a lot of strange things happening in the GDR, but this story is highly unlikely.
The name ""Martin Zeichnete"" points toward [a=Drew McFadyen] as the master mind behind this, as ""Zeichnete"" in German language is the indicative form of the verb ""zeichnen"". Zeichnen translated to english would be ""drawing"" or ""to draw"". The indicative form of ""drawing"" is ""drew"". Drew like in Drew McFadyen. The last name ""Zeichnete"" does not exist in Germany - there are about 800.000 surnames in the German history, but ""Zeichnete"" is not one of them.
Drew runs the label [l1512693] that releases all of / and only the works of [a=Kosmischer Läufer] and he was also on stage presenting and performing some works of [a=Martin Zeichnete] during a tour with [a=Yann Tiersen] (these recordings were also published as [m=1415720]). When asked in an interview Drew explained that ""Martin Zeichnete"" supposedly is not the real name of the artist, but a pseudonym as well as an injoke towards his new friend Drew McFadyen."

Despite being from Berkeley, California, the band's music usually invoked imagery of the American South.

John Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford initially joined forces in 1959 as The Blue Velvets and later backed John's older brother, Tom, as Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets.  The group later changed their name to the Golliwogs and released several unsuccessful singles.  In 1967, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival and John Fogerty took total control of the group.  CCR was extremely prolific, releasing 6 albums and various singles between 1968 and 1970.  However, the other members of the band chafed under John Fogerty's domination and in 1971 it was announced that Tom Fogerty had left the band.  CCR made one more album, 1972's ""Mardi Gras"", as a trio.  In the wake of Tom's departure, John, responding the other members' requests to have more say in band matters, stipulated that both Cook and Clifford had to contribute equally to the writing and recording.  The album was poorly received and CCR subsequently split.

In the years following their split, the animosities between John and the other members grew.  When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1993, John infamously barred Cook and Clifford from the stage (Tom had passed away in 1990).

Formed in 2009 in in East Kilbride / Glasgow.

Helicon are psychedelic haze & gaze merchants formed in East Kilbride / Glasgow by brothers John-Paul and Gary Hughes (both guitars/vocals), and Laura O'Brien (keys/violin). Soon after, they recruited Steven Jamieson on bass and Martin MacVicar on drums. The band has now been together since around early 2009 and continue to build on an already expanding psychedelic sound, live show and fan base. Lifelong comrade Gary Sharp, who aside from occasionally playing live with the band, contributes to musical ideas and chips in with percussion and instrumentation on recordings. More recently, Helicon added a 3rd guitarist, Craig ‘Gally’ Gallagher, who adds to their already unmistakable effect ridden, thunderous live sound and layered instrumentation.
There is definitely something inherently Scottish, especially Glaswegian, about Helicon’s lyrics in the sense of their sneering sarcasm and cynicism and relation to the darker side of love and life. They feel they cannot fail to be influenced in some way by religion, drink and drugs in this part of the world such is their effect on our society... for good and bad. Their mis-spent youth, listening to The Doors and The Velvet Underground, hiding from the rain and trying not to become tracksuit wearing bigots seem to have helped shape Helicon’s tastes and opinions. The major issue for them is how few people here get them or the psychedelic genre as a whole in this country. Its Helicon’s belief that it’s high time there was some decent smoke and psychedelic drugs slipped into the mainstream to turn the kids off the fucking bile they are being subjected to. When various bands they adore hail from your front door step, and 90% of the population don’t know who they are, it’s their belief there’s something deeply wrong with our society.

The band consisted of Kevin Patterson (vocals), Chic Medley (guitar), Graham McGregor (bass guitar), Eddie Jordan (keyboards) and former [a=Simple Minds] member Mike Ogletree (drums). 

Before forming Fiction Factory, Patterson, Jordan, and Medley played in the ska band The Rude Boys (later shortened to [a=The RB's]) until that group broke up in 1982. Shortly after the group's formation, CBS asked the founding members to create a concert-playing band, so McGregor and Ogletree were enlisted on bass and drums, respectively. 

Their 1983 single ""(Feels Like) Heaven"" became a UK Top 10 hit (also reaching the Top 10 in Germany and Switzerland), although their followup single, ""All or Nothing"" failed to make the UK Top 100. The group's first album, ""Throw the Warped Wheel Out"", also failed to chart despite the strength of ""(Feels Like) Heaven"".

In 1985, the band released their second and final album, ""Another Story"", on Foundry Records. By this time, Eddie Jordan, Graham MacGregor and Mike Ogletree had left the group, with most of their roles being filled in by session musicians on the album. Neither the album or its three singles reached any commercial success, and Fiction Factory broke up in 1987.

After their disbandment, Patterson left the music industry and currently works in the IT department at the University of Dundee; he has a wife and two children. Patterson and Jordan reunited to perform ""(Feels Like) Heaven"" with a backing band at Jordan's wedding in August 2007. Medley went on to work with the Scottish world music project, [a=Mouth Music].

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond. However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG. Phil Mogg and Andy Parker were still members of UFO by 2019, when the band began what they called a farewell tour.

With catchy songs full of bright, jangly guitars and clever lyrics about northern life, the band’s 2017 debut album* ‘Northern Powerhouse’* and 2018 follow-up EP ‘Good Morning, Bad Blood’ were both met with rave reviews. Songwriter Joe Hodgson's lyrics are evocative tales of love, loss and life in Northern industrial towns set to jangly, melancholic guitars that have drawn comparisons with a sound similar to The Smiths and The Housemartins. Sepia-tinged yet humorous, they offer an insight into life in a former ship building town.

The group release their eagerly-awaited new album ‘Frame Yourself’ in Spring 2020 and will be taking their new tracks and thrilling live show on the road throughout the year.

UFO's story began in London back in 1969, when vocalist Phil Mogg, drummer Andy Parker, guitarist Mick Bolton and bassist Pete Way formed the group.

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond. However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG. Phil Mogg and Andy Parker were still members of UFO by 2019, when the band began what they called a farewell tour. Mogg's health issues resulted in UFO cancelling what was planned to be one last tour in 2022, and in April 2024, he confirmed that the band was finished."

Self description of the project:
""In East Germany in the early 1970’s Martin Zeichnete worked as a sound editor for DEFA, (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), the state-owned film studio. Like many young East Germans of the time he would listen furtively to West German radio at night and became infatuated with the Kosmische Musik or ‘Krautrock’ epitomised by the likes of Kraftwerk, Neu! and Cluster emerging from his neighbouring country. Martin, a keen runner, hit upon the idea of using the repetitive, motorik beats of this new music as a training aid for athletes. He thought it could benefit the mind as well as the body with the pulsing, hypnotic music bringing focus. A ‘borrowed’ prototype of Andreas Pavel’s Stereobelt showed Martin the technology to provide music on the move already existed and could easily be adapted for runners.

After sharing his concept with colleagues Martin was taken from his studio to East Berlin, quizzed by the authorities about his ideas and, fearing the worst, was surprised to find himself put to work by the Nationales Olympisches Komitee immediately. Installed in a cold Berlin studio with the few electronic instruments the state could supply, (Martin asked for a Moog but was refused), he began one of the strangest journeys in music. Known to the government as State Plan 14.84L, Martin and his fellow musicians informally called it ‘Projekt Kosmischer Läufer’ (Cosmic Runner).

For the next 11 years Martin would be spirited to Berlin to work on tracks with little notice. He created hours of music fusing traditional rock instruments with synthesizers, early drum computers, tape slicing and looping techniques he and his engineer formulated themselves. His output included tracks for running at various paces, warm up pieces, ‘ambient’ music to play in gyms during training and pieces for artistic gymnastic routines.""

This is widely believed to be an elaborate hoax with a lot of manufactured evidence of the existence of [a=Martin Zeichnete]. There were a lot of strange things happening in the GDR, but this story is highly unlikely.
The name ""Martin Zeichnete"" points toward [a=Drew McFadyen] as the master mind behind this, as ""Zeichnete"" in German language is the indicative form of the verb ""zeichnen"". Zeichnen translated to english would be ""drawing"" or ""to draw"". The indicative form of ""drawing"" is ""drew"". Drew like in Drew McFadyen. The last name ""Zeichnete"" does not exist in Germany - there are about 800.000 surnames in the German history, but ""Zeichnete"" is not one of them.
Drew runs the label [l1512693] that releases all of / and only the works of [a=Kosmischer Läufer] and he was also on stage presenting and performing some works of [a=Martin Zeichnete] during a tour with [a=Yann Tiersen] (these recordings were also published as [m=1415720]). When asked in an interview Drew explained that ""Martin Zeichnete"" supposedly is not the real name of the artist, but a pseudonym as well as an injoke towards his new friend Drew McFadyen."

By the late 1950s, he started a career as a schoolteacher. As a tall and imposing young man, Ferry also started a parallel career as a boxer. When he wasn’t teaching or fighting, he also caught up with the emerging night scene in the city of Cotonou, where local folklore, Congolese rumba, highlife and Cuban adaptations were favoured by local audiences as well as some blues, jazz and rhythm’n’blues. By the late 1960s, Ferry had relocated to Paris where he became a policeman, often asked to assist Jacques Chirac on various missions before the future President of France became mayor of Paris in 1977. It was here in the early ‘70s he recorded his first two singles, ‘A Were Were We Coco’ and ‘Aluma Loranmi Nichai’. These songs met little interest and by 1974 Ferry was back in Cotonou.

His return to Benin coincided with 1972s revolution’s journey toward Marxist-Leninism. The country’s leader Mathieu Kerekou was impressed by Ferry’s charisma and striking look and became fast friends with him. He saw in him a personality that could seduce the younger generation in a funkier way than straight Socialist speeches. He allowed Ferry a certain budget to start his own record company called Revolution Records.
Inspired by Afrobeat, Nigeria’s Fela Kuti and his musical journey over the past decade, Ferry recorded Rhythm Revolution in Cotonou at the Satel studio. Wanting his musical vision to stay as intact and raw as possible, Ferry played most of the instruments himself – guitar, saxophone, drums/percussion and keyboards.

By 1977, on the advice of Fela Kuti, Ferry had relocated to neighbouring Lagos with his family. He often visited his friends Fela, Orlando Julius and Geraldo Pino and hung around with Juju music master King Sunny Ade. In early 1980, he got to meet up with his long-time idol, Mohammed Ali, who was on an official visit to Lagos in order to convince Nigeria to boycott the 1980’s Moscow Olympics.

Keeping his artistic vision intact, Ferry continued touring and recording music with his family band, the Sunshine Sisters, but these songs were never released. A heavy smoker, Ferry died of a heart failure on 29th May 1996 in Lagos."

Since 1997, ABC has been the solo project of singer and founder Martin Fry, who works with a variety of musicians.

White and Singleton started out as [a=Vice Versa (4)], who released an EP ""[r=391552]"" in 1979 and contributed the track ""Genetic Warfare"" to a compilation, ""[r=472466]"" before adding Fry to the lineup and mutating into ABC.

During the late '70s, Fry ran his own fanzine, Modern Drugs, while he attended Sheffield University. ABC formed in 1980, after Fry interviewed Vice Versa members Mark White (guitar) and Stephen Singleton (saxophone) for his fanzine. The two musicians asked Fry to join their band as a vocalist, and he soon became part of the group; the lineup also featured drummer David Robinson and bassist Mark Lickley.

Soon, Fry had taken control of the electronic band, he recruited [a=Trevor Horn] as producer to steer them in a more pop-oriented direction and renamed the group ABC. By the fall of 1981, the band had signed a record contract with Phonogram Records, which agreed to distribute ABC's own label, Neutron. ABC released their first single, ""Tears Are Not Enough,"" in November; it peaked at number 19 on the U.K. charts. "

Ofege was largely influenced by the guitar solos of Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Francis Rossi, and the criss-cross rhythms of Osibisa. At home, they were influenced by the music of ‘BLO’ (Berkley Jones, Laolu Akins and Mike Odumosu), ‘Monomono’ (led by Joni Haastrup), The Funkees, and Ofo The Black Company. Comband Razor said ""It's clear that for Ofege, songs were largely incidental, little more than excuses to launch into insane, distorted guitar solos. It's also very clear that they smoked a lot of weed."" Their first album was recorded while the band members were still in high school (average age of 16), Ofege’s debut album ""Try And Love"" was originally recorded and released in 1973 and overdubbed by Berkley Jones' guitar. Due to their vibrant combo of sweet harmonies, hooks & fuzz, they would become one of the most legendary Nigerian groups of all time, with impressive sales and national stardom.
However, with only four albums released until 1978 and no recognition outside Nigeria, Ofege’s short career would only be rediscovered with the turn of the century.

""The Last Of The Origins"" is a great funk-rock record with a rather psychedelic approach. The rhythm section is attractive and complex and has African inspirations. The lyrics aren’t particlulary inspired, but the drive is incredible, and they draw attention to instrumental parts wherever they can. The psychedelic organ takes care of the mind-losing groove, while fuzz guitars soar and improvise. The 60s influenced vocals can be reminiscent of the Stones, or just leave themselves flooding with the psychedelic drive. 

It took some years before other albums appeared since some band members still had to finish university.

Melvin Noks: Lead Vocals/Rhythm.
Paul Alade: Bass Guitar.

The gritty, genre-blending artist is an amalgam of the incredibly rich history of the city from Jimi Hendrix to Nirvana. Cultivating a robust following in the Pacific Northwest, cementing himself as a Seattle name and earning the embrace of the city’s musical royalty including Duff McKagan, Mike McCready, and more - his independent rise allowed him to hone his creative vision before signing with Big Machine/John Varvatos Records on the next step of his musical and creative journey. His debut single “Take Me Away” cemented that vision and chart topping success, hitting Top 5 at Rock Radio and setting the bar for singles to come, including his latest “Mercy.” Jones penned the song last summer alongside Marty Frederickson and Scott Stevens, and by that point, during one of the most tumultuous years in recent American history, the whole world appeared to be on fire. The song, full of charged lyrics and melodies, strongly captures a collective consciousness of the time. It is also, though, underscored by a vision of hope and endurance: through it all, we persevere. As Jones continues his ascent in the Rock World he also continues breaking barriers, as he explains ""being black in the rock industry, I was forging a path into establishments and onto tours that had not previously embraced an artist like me. But the one thing that always changed minds and spoke for itself was the music.” His reach now extends well beyond Seattle, playing alongside such acts as Run DMC, Public Enemy, Rahkim, Jeff Beck, Theory of a Deadman, Robin Trower, and Spearhead, as well as opening for iconic acts such as Guns ’N’ Roses at the Gorge and B.B. King plus notable festival performances to include SXSW, Sasquatch, and Bumbershoot."

The group was founded by Kentucky born guitarist [a306064] (previously of [a870578]) with drummer [a747527] (formerly of [a1021898]) at a jam session in the notorious ON Klub in Silverlake. The other guitar player was [a179560], who soon left to form [a306995], whereupon Virginia’s [a306083] joined after answering a want ad in a local newspaper. The original bass player was [a778415] but he quit to return to graduate school and was replaced by ex-pat Englishman [a778414]. This lineup recorded and released an EP [m=90565], produced by ex-[a6271] guitarist/former [a70829] engineer [a266053]. A US tour followed. Des Brewer dropped out at this point to continue his career as a longshoreman in San Pedro and was replaced by Indiana’s [a747526].

The group signed to indie label [l33807] and recorded their debut LP [m=212020] which was produced by [a259822]. The album was called “a modern American classic” by Melody Maker and the band made the cover of the New Musical Express as well as playing live on the BBC’s Whistle Test TV show. The band toured the US in 1984, and Europe in March/April 1985. Next the band signed to [l8377] and released the album [m=90563] in September 1985, which hit number one in the College Radio/Alternative charts for four weeks. After a spring tour the band released [m=90564] in early summer 1987. Produced by [a241495], the album produced the hit single “[m=389736]”. 

Bassist Tom Stevens left the road to be with his family in August and by Christmas Stephen McCarthy left to write musicials. Island asked Griffin and Sowders for another album but they declined. Since then the band has released several reissues, [r=3262757] on [l212596], released June 2004, and [r=3262716], a reprise of the Ryders reunion tour released in October 2008. In 2014 the band played their first L.A. show in 27 years, the Earle Mankey Appreciation Concert. A short run of dates in Spain followed in December of that year. On January 22, 2016, [l5174] released a four CD box set [r=8080345]. "

He writes using a blend of Folk rock, Ballads and American Nostalgia.
Starting his career in the early 00's with the trio Easyworld, Ford found cult success with the group, releasing 2 albums and a slew of singles with the project. Upon its dissolvement in 2004 he was eager to keep his creativity aflame, performing a number of solo gigs where he'd debut a number of songs that would appear on his 2005 debut album '[m=223732]', from which the fan favourite '[m=612397]' would be released as his first single. Following a sold out tour the follow up folk ballad '[m=269092]' would be released in February 2006. After a successful run supporting musicians in the US his debut was re-released by Columbia records.

The sophomore album '[m=604451]' in August 2007 and was released in the US the following year, with the Smiths' cover ""There Is A Light"" as a bonus track. It included the singles 'Go To Hell', 'Decimate' and 'I'm Alright Now'. In 2009 an EP of the same name was released, featuring live versions of songs from the album.

His third studio album '[m=450282]' was released in February 2010 and included the single 'Panic'. In 2011 the autobiography 'I Choose This' was released. It documented his time in the music industry to that point, including the trials & tribulations of the music industry and near misses to stardom. 

Between 2011-2012 a number of EP's were released to showcase what was to come from his fourth album. This included '[r=8861612]' which featured live favourite 'The Ballad Of Miss Lily' for the first time.

In 2013 David Ford released his most successful album to date '[m=959891]'. The first of his back catalogue to be released on vinyl, 'Charge' was produced by James Brown and debuted at number 30 in the UK Independent chart. It was released on CD in the US with 4 bonus tracks that were recorded at Ford's Piano Bar.  The album featured the singles 'Perfect Soul' & 'Pour A Little Poison', as well as the previously released songs 'The Ballad Of Miss Lily', 'Every Time' and more.

In 2014 Ford was awarded ""Best Original Song"" at the Victoires de la Musique awards for the track '20 ans',  a French version of his song 'I'm Alright Now'. The same year he released the mini-album '[r=14832151]'.

In 2017 '[r=10713175]' was released as a precursor for his next record and features the song 'Why Won't You Answer Your Telephone?'.

2018 saw the release of his 5th album '[m=2814584]' via the label One Horse. A collection of demos titled '[r=22263268]' would debut on his Bandcamp in 2021.

Throughout 2020 Ford recorded new songs that reflected time spent in lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He would also regularly post free music to his bandcamp page, including the albums '[r=22262560]' - a collection of songs recorded from his 2019 UK tour, '[r=22262698]' - a collection of recordings that chart the evolution of the tracks that make up the album 'Songs For The Road' and the compilation '[r=22263034]', showcasing b-sides and rarities from throughout his career that never made it to albums. There was also the EP '[r=22256131]' - a re-recording of Easyworld favourites.

In 2022 Ford took the songs he'd written throughout the pandemic and released them as '[m=2804732]'. Some of the tracks had previously been made available for free via Bandcamp.
That same year due to the success of the single 'Just Like You' and the live track '[r=23273075]', Ford released a duet record with [a3793158] titled '[m=2939014]' and featured the single 'Warning Sign'.
In September 2022 the album '[r=24676154]' was released and included the single 'When We Were Young'.
In 2023 Ford announced the side-project [a13653994]. This act focused more on instrumental cinematic post rock styles. 

Since the early days of his solo output, David Ford has hosted an event titled 'Milk & Cookies'. This is a fundraising event where he performs songs for donations, as well as sets up auctions for memorabilia and has been a popular outing for fans. Some of his performances have been released on limited edition CD and have also found their way onto YouTube.

Reformed in 2016, Esprit D’Air is an electronic rock & space metal band based in London. Led by vocalist, guitarist and producer, Kai, their sound is unique and fresh in its ability to fuse hard-hitting aggression with melodic interludes and blistering guitar solos.

Esprit D’Air garnered a cult following with their charismatic performances reminiscent of a young X Japan, and a style that can only be described as: “Shibuya meets Sunset Strip”! They were the first Japanese-language band to appear on the videogame, Rock Band 3 for the Xbox 360.

The band are not seeking a major record label, but instead follow a strong DIY ethos and produce everything themselves to be as self-sufficient as possible. Consequently, they record, mix and master their own releases in their own home recording studio and produce the artwork themselves.

The first and only demo was called ""Ungentle Exhumation"" and was released in the following year. In 1994 their first full-length was released, ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"", and it gained them succes and a good reputation in the underground. In 1996 they released the classic ""None So Vile"" which was a huge succes and surpassed other bands in terms of brutality. Sadly, Lord Worm left the band after the release. Michael DiSalvo (Infestation) later joined the band and he was the perfect replacement. After an impressive live show at the Milwaukee Metal Festival the band were signed to Century Media Records. 

With a new frontman and a record deal, the band recorded ""Whisper Supremacy"" which was released in 1998. They went on tours around the world and sales were up to 50,000 copies. Cryptopsy was becoming bigger and bigger and more live shows where played including the Dynamo Festival in Holland and several shows in Japan. 

After a wealth of tours the band returned to the studio and recorded ""And Then You'll Beg"" which was released in 2000. In August 2001, vocalist Michael DiSalvo was replaced by Martin Lacroix. In 2003 they released the live album, ""None So Live"", which was the last to feature Martin Lacroix as he left the band shortly after. His replacement was none other than the original vocalist, Lord Worm. In 2005, they recorded a new studio album entitled ""Once Was Not"". 

In 2008, ""The Unspoken King"" album marks the debut of Matt McGachy as well as the first and only appearance on a Cryptopsy album by Maggie Durand, as well as the band's departure from the death metal genre. The band instead perform deathcore on this album. 

After being on a record label for their entire career, Cryptopsy decided to go independent in 2012. Cryptopsy released independently the eponymous album on September 14, 2012. The album marked a return to their technical death metal sound.

In 2015, rather than a full album, Cryptopsy released the first instalment (Tome 1) of a series of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering. The band has said that The Book of Suffering Tome 1 is some of the most brutal, dark and technical music they have ever created."

For Nordic Giants the performance is the thing, and as those who have seen the live show will attest, it is a visceral experience that goes beyond the normal descriptors. Each mind-blowing performance involves a chosen few short films, which are soundtracked live with atmospheric soundscapes.

“Air whistles and whines around my ears, Distant echoes drift through endless minds, And magnetised to empty thoughts” 
Largely instrumental, A Séance Of Dark Delusions reflects the inspired musical experimentation and atmosphere of SigurRós, 65daysofstatic, Bjork and Pink Floyd. Nordic Giants bring a heavy orchestral brutality through progressive guitar, drum and brass, which are paired with beautiful and haunting electronics as they warp loops and end of the world samples through pattered keys.
“The hollow sound resonates from morbid tone, And aloft the music goes, Notes bend and warp as the swell rolls” 
When they pull lyricism from the human world, Nordic Giants enlist the vocal features of artists, Saturday Sun (‘Dissolve’), Nadine Wild Palmer (‘Futures Dark’), Freyja (‘Give Flight To The Imagination’), and Beth Cannon (‘Rapture’). 
“Unborn thoughts sleep silently in the mind, A heavy cushion of warm unblemished noise, The heart beats slowly in time with the dull thud of drum”

Formed by guitarist Kirk Hammett & drummer Tom Hunting (who initially handled vocals as well). The group was rounded out by guitarist Tim Agnello and bassist Carlton Melson. The line up shifted several times in the early years.

1982 - 1985

In 1982, Exodus included Kirk Hammett and Gary Holt on guitars, Paul Baloff on lead vocals, Geoff Andrews on bass and drummer Tom Hunting. This lineup recorded the band's 1982 demo.

In 1983, founding member Kirk Hammett left Exodus to join Metallica and was replaced by guitarist Rick Hunolt and Rob McKillop replaced Andrews on bass. This line-up recorded and released their debut album, ""Bonded by Blood"" in 1984 (released in 1985).

1986 - 1991

Shortly before the recording of ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" in 1987, Paul Baloff was replaced by Steve ""Zetro"" Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for the San Francisco band Legacy (later known as Testament). Baloff later went on to form the band [a=Piranha (9)].

In 1989, the band released ""Fabulous Disaster"" which garnered good press and, eventually, a major label deal.  That same year, Tom Hunting departed, leaving the group with no founding members.  In 1991 the band released their first live effort, ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", which featured new bassist Mike Butler.

1991 - 1998

After the release of ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", the band toured sporadically for a year and released another studio album, ""Force of Habit"". This album was a departure for the band, containing several slower, ""heavier"" songs with less emphasis on the speed/thrash basis of their older material.  Unable to match the commercial success of some of their peers and dealing with internal stresses and problems, Exodus split in 1994.

After a few dormant years, Exodus released only another live album in 1997 titled ""Another Lesson in Violence"" and featuring the return of vocalist Paul Baloff and new bassist Jack Gibson. Exodus disintegrated again, partly due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

2001 - 2004

In 2001, Exodus reformed again, initially to play the Chuck Billy benefit, the ""Thrash of the Titans"" mega concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local gigs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. In February 2002, Paul Baloff suffered a seizure/stroke from which he eventually died. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments.

Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004's ""Tempo of the Damned"" released on Nuclear Blast.

2005 - Present

In 2005, Hunolt decided to leave the band to concentrate on his family life. He was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also left, citing strong personal objections over some of Holt's anti-Christian lyrics as well as anxiety issues. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph who had previously played with Forbidden, Slayer and Testament.  Souza also left under disputed terms in 2005. 
He was replaced intitially by Steev Esquivel (ex-Defiance and Skinlab) and then later by Rob Dukes whose first recorded performance for the band is 2005's ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine"". 

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007.  In 2012, Rick Hunolt returned in a guest role, filling in for Gary Holt on several live dates while Holt toured with [a=Slayer].  In 2014, Steve Souza returned to the group. He departed again in January 2025, with Rob Dukes returning as vocalist.

After a few members left the band in 1994, they started to record their first non-metal album ""Wildhoney"". This album was the new Tiamat with their psychedelic goth rock style.
In 1995, Johan Edlund permanently moved to Dortmund, Germany, where most of the albums were recorded, and he also turned Tiamat into a personal project by declaring himself as the only official member.

It was originally a solo project, and the debut album [m=12670], released in 1995, was almost entirely performed by Townsend. He soon assembled a line-up of permanent members for the band's second album [m=12679], released in 1997. The band became characterized by extreme and fast songs, led by diverse vocals provided by Townsend, and a powerful ""wall of sound"" production obtained with the use of several layers of effects, which also became a distinctive trait of all of Townsend's works. Following a decision of focusing on his solo career, and also due to challenges in his personal life, Townsend placed Strapping Young Lad on hiatus in 1998.

Townsend reassembled the band in 2002 to record and release the self-titled third studio album in 2003. Two years later, the fourth album [m=12753] was released to critical acclaim. Following the release of the fifth and final album in 2006, the band was viewed to be at the peak of its popularity, playing to some of the largest audiences in its career. After the tour, Townsend put the band on hold, naming exhaustion as one of the reasons. In May 2007, Townsend announced his plans to withdraw from the public eye for a while and focus on other projects. As a result, Strapping Young Lad was effectively disbanded.

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

Graveland's style has changed from raw black metal on the early albums to a more epic sound which is inspired by Hammerheart-era Bathory. Lyrically, on the early works Rob Darken was inspired by Celtic beliefs, now he's Wotanism-orientated and calls his music ""epic pagan metal"". Several early releases and interviews with Rob Darken show antisemitic and pro-fascist tendencies.

One of the band logo was done by Christophe ""Volvox"" Szpajdel. This logo appears for the first time on ""Carpathian Wolves"" and was used up to ""Immortal Pride"", however it showed an inverted cross instead the thorshammer. This logo was replaced by a lettering in red Fraktur capitals during 1999 and 2003. Since ""Dawn of Iron Blades"", Graveland uses the shown logo.

All rereleases by No Colours Records after 2001 omit all lyrics in the booklets.

The song ""Spear of Wotan"" was included on the compilation The Night and Fog Vol. 3 which was released by Totenkopf Propaganda in 2007. A shorter version of ""Legion of Giants"" appears on ""No Colours Records Compilaton II"".

German BPjM (Federal Authority for Publications unsafe for the Youth) forbade the sale of 6 Graveland albums in Germany (namely: ""Following the Voice of Blood"", ""Immortal Pride"", ""In the Glare of Burning Churches"", ""The Celtic Winter"", ""Blood of Heroes"" and ""Dawn of Iron Blades"").

In May 2008, German police raided the office of No Colours Records and confiscated about 1500 banned Graveland CDs. After this, the rights to these Graveland's albums on No Colours Records were transferred to Forever Plagued Records.

Graveland played their first concert on 2 April 2016 in Milan, Italy. The second concert, and the first in their native country of Poland, took place on 22 April 2016 during Pomerania Fest vol. 1: Pagan Territory.
They toured Latin America for the first time in May 2017."

The band was created as a ""new start and new direction"" for Nelson, and was active throughout 1979, even performing a UK tour throughout March of that year, but by 1980 the band had disintegrated, marking the beginning of Bill Nelson's solo career.

It is worth noting that Bill's second solo album [r=874805] was to be Red Noise's second LP, however the band were dropped by EMI before it could be released and since EMI owned the tapes Bill was unable to release the album until 1981.

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Initially known as Sweet Vengeance, guitarist/vocalist Chris Astley, guitarist Kristian Havard, drummer Dennis Gasser and bassist Paul Mackenzie created enough of a stir through their live performances that the English branch of Roadrunner Records took notice and signed the group in January 1989.

After releasing a string of well-received albums, Xentrix broke up in 1997. The band cited the fact that metal was declining in popularity as one of the reasons for the split. Xentrix reunited with the ""Shattered Existence"" lineup in 2005 and played some shows around the UK the following year before parting ways once again.

In February 2013, Xentrix announced their second reunion, again featuring the ""Shattered Existence"" lineup, although Paul MacKenzie left the band shortly and was replaced on bass by Chris Shires. Astley eventually left the band once again (having left for the first time in 1994) and was replaced by Jay Walsh in 2017. Xentrix have since continued touring and releasing music."

Sir Karl Jenkins is Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), Knight Bachelor, Fellow of the [l=Royal Academy of Music] (FRAM), and Honorary Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (HonFSLW). He performs on baritone & soprano saxophones, oboe, and keyboards. Jenkins grew up in Penclawdd village in Gower (now part of Swansea), born to a Swedish mother and Welsh father, a chapel organist and choirmaster, who gave Karl his first music lessons. In high school, 12-year-old Jenkins began playing oboe in the [a=National Youth Orchestra Of Wales]. He got formally educated at [l=Cardiff University], followed by postgraduate studies at the [l=Royal Academy of Music] in London.

Early in his career, Karl Jenkins was primarily known as a jazz and fusion / jazz-rock saxophonist, oboist, and keyboard player. He participated in several of [a=Graham Collier]'s ensembles and was active in the early free jazz / improv UK scene. In 1969, Jenkins co-founded the [b][url=https://discogs.com/artist/184256]Nucleus[/url][/b] band, which won the [l=Montreux Jazz Festival]'s first prize and headlined the [l=Newport Jazz Festival] the following year. As a session player and band member, Karl Jenkins appeared on such notable albums as [a=Elton John]'s [i][m=84216][/i] (1970) or [i][m=197775][/i] (1972) by [a=Barry Guy] with [a=London Jazz Composers Orchestra]. (Jenkins played alongside [a=Mark Charig] on a bugle and [a=Alan Wakeman] on tenor & soprano saxophones, cousin of [a=Rick Wakeman] of [a=Yes] fame).

In 1972, Karl Jenkins joined [b][a=Soft Machine][/b], a prog / jazz-rock / fusion band from Canterbury formed by [a=Mike Ratledge]. He remained with the group until 1978 (and joined for brief reunions in 1980–81 and '84), active as a lead composer on many Soft Machine LPs. Jenkins toured extensively with the band, performing at [l=Carnegie Hall], the [l=Royal Albert Hall]'s ""Proms"" and [l=The Reading Festival]. In November 1973, Jenkins and Ratledge participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of [a=Mike Oldfield]'s [i][m=15016][/i] for the [l=BBC] (available on [i][m=315636][/i] VHS/DVD compilation). Jenkins also recorded library music with Ratledge, sometimes using the Rubba moniker.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Karl Jenkins mainly focused on commercial music. Collaborating with [url=https://discogs.com/label/1372991]Bartle Bogle Hegarty[/url] agency, Jenkins created soundtracks for [l=Levi's], [l=Renault], and De Beers, among other prominent clients. (Karl subsequently developed De Beers' theme into a full-length orchestral work, [i][m=585426][/i]). In 1994, Jenkins started [b][a=Adiemus][/b] - a series of orchestral new-age albums with vocals. (The opening song on the debut album, [i][m=10543][/i], released in 1995 on CD/Cassette by [l=Virgin], was based on Karl's TV commercial tune for [l=Delta Air Lines].) Notably, all singing was in a fictional lyrical language, vaguely reminiscent of Latin, and constructed by Jenkins purely phonetically. (Similar to the [i]Kobaïan[/i] language invented by French drummer and musician [a=Christian Vander] for [url=https://discogs.com/artist/179749]Magma[/url] band).

In 1999, Jenkins wrote [i][m=620433][/i], a neo-classical Mass for orchestra and mixed choir, commissioned by the Royal Armouries and debuted at [l=Royal Albert Hall]. Since then, it become one of Karl's best-known works, with over 400 performances and several critically-acclaimed recordings. In May 2023, Jenkins commissioned [i]Tros Y Garreg[/i] (Crossing The Stone in English), one of 12 new works for the coronation of [url=https://discogs.com/artist/2253564]Charles III[/url], attending its debut performance at [l=Westminster Abbey]'s ceremony. His photos from the event briefly circulated in the media, starting with memes joking that Karl was, instead, Meghan Markle ([a=HRH Prince Harry]'s wife and estranged Duchess of Sussex) in buffoonish disguise, and subsequently numerous debunkings in high-profile press."

Phil Scragg, Matt Berry and James Sedge have been writing and recording remotely during 2020 on a new side project called Milkbone. There were no preconceptions about the material apart from initial references to artists such as Weather Report, Eno, Brand X, Gong, Mike Oldfield etc...The music came together quickly with ideas flowing right from the start.
The album 'Milkbone' will initially be released only as a limited edition vinyl record that will be made available soon.

A true labour of love, the trio's magical 2021 debut offers an inspired evocation of the classic early 1970s Canterbury sound fused with elements of Electronic and Fusion music (with echoes of peak period Soft Machine, Weather Report, Jean-Michel Jarre, Terry Riley, Robert Wyatt and more).

Graham Mann (trombone/percussion) and Cecilia Fage (vocals) guest.

Milkbone is the name of musician and comedian, Matt Berry’s latest musical project. Evoking the jazz-rock stylings of Brand X, Gong, Weather Report etc... the new group features bassist Phil Scragg and drummer James Sedge alongside Berry on keyboards. You can listen to a teaser of the band's upcoming album below.

Having previously worked together in Matt Berry and The Maypoles, the seeds of the idea of a group coming together on the band’s tour bus where they shared their mutual admiration for 1970s-era progressive and electronic music. “We decided to make an instrumental album that channeled/referenced our shared love of Canterbury era prog mixed with European electronica, Electric period Miles Davis as well as a love of the instruments, both acoustic and electronic, associated with those genres,” explains James Sedge.

“We were aspiring to get some of the atmosphere and ‘wonkiness’ of the recordings of that era rather than the sterile precision you occasionally encounter in contemporary production. We all enjoy the sound of real instruments playing with sequenced synths - the perfection of the sequencer with the imperfections of live drums and bass. We left in all the quirky feel things, so it wouldn’t sound overproduced and polished,” says Sedge.

Because of Covid restrictions, the album was recorded remotely with the players file-sharing remotely from their respective studios but Sedge says rather than letting this factor inhibit their creativity, they were able to exploit it to their advantage. “The music came together surprisingly quickly, with ideas flowing between the three of us right from the start. There was a lot of freedom to improvise and change direction. Tracks would be sent back and forth with ideas added or subtracted. Occasionally the contribution of one of us would be a complete surprise and take the music in a completely new direction.”

The trio’s self-titled album will be released on a limited-edition vinyl-only album via Burning Shed though the date has yet to be finalised. You can view the album artwork and tracklisting below.

“This is a studio project for now, but there are discussions about how we might bring it to a live audience in the not too distant future,” says Sedge."

Nag and Bendle lacked any musical training or experience, but they nevertheless started by securing a concert gig for T.D.A.T.W., and then booked rehearsal studio to record their debut EP on a simple cassette recorder.

Inspired by [a=Throbbing Gristle], [a=File Under Pop] and the 'do-it-yourself' aesthetics of UK punk movement, the duo recorded and self-released [r=816612] on 7"" through the newly established [l=NB Records (4)] label. The edition of 1000 copies arrived from the pressing plant with white labels in plain sleeves, so Nag and Bendle hand-painted all the covers, and managed to distribute the entire stock.

The follow-up 7"" [r=816595] was released the same year, distributed by [l=Rough Trade]. Vinyl with photocopied cover and folded A4 inlay was packaged in a clear plastic sleeve, with 'tracklist' stickers on white labels. Inspired by anarcho-punks [a=Crass], T.D.A.T.W. wrote [i]Do not pay more than 55p[/i] on the cover, but the distributor nevertheless managed to sold out the edition of 2000 copies.

The band's popularity quickly grew, and they started regularly performing with [a=The Pop Group], [a=Scritti Politti], [a=Delta 5], [a=Swell Maps], [a=The Raincoats] and other prominent UK bands. The Door And The Window joined [a=The Instant Automatons] on [i]Weird Noise Tour[/i]. They also produced a couple tape releases on NB Records, incl. [r=2298064] (NB 2), available for £1.50, and [r=2298080] (NB 9) in 1980. NB Records was responsible for a few releases by T.D.A.T.W's friends and colleagues, such as [url=https://discogs.com/release/2291463]Wonder Only 85 Pennies[/url], a debut 7"" single by [a=The 49 Americans].

[a=Mark Perry] left [a=Alternative TV] in late 1979, and joined T.D.A.T.W. as the drummer and co-writer. The band had a flexible line-up, with occasional guest members including [a=Fritz Catlin] of [a=23 Skidoo], [a=Dennis Burns] (ATV/[a=The Good Missionaries]), [a=Grant Showbiz], and 49 Americans' founder [a=Giblet]. 

In 1980, the band self-released their debut [r=1412008] LP, in stores at the ridiculously low price of £3.00, and again selling out 2000 copies.

Blake began his career singing and playing bass in a Joy Division covers band at school but he didn’t discover his song-writing abilities until his late twenties. In 2004, his home-recorded debut album, Solomon’s Tump, came to the attention of London indie label Ecto Music and he was asked to sign as a solo artist. By this time Blake had formed a psychedelic rock band called ‘Karma Truffle’ and he persuaded the label to sign the band instead. After recording an E.P. and one album, the band split and Blake struck out on his own, recording his music at home and developing an underground following as a DIY artist. He adopted the moniker ‘Blake’ inspired by William Blake, his favourite poet who self-published his works using a home-made printing press.


Blake’s crowd-funded 2012 album, Stay Human, was dedicated to the murdered Italian peace activist Vittorio Arrigoni and released on 208 Records to critical acclaim. In 2014, Blake was invited to perform songs from Stay Human and its follow-up, Star Over Bethlehem, at the ‘Bethlehem Live’ music festival in Palestine. His 2015 song, ‘Vinyl Junkie’, is featured in the British crime film, ‘Dragonflies Only Live for 24 Hours’. RIDE, Blake’s 2018 album, was also crowd-funded and marked his first release on vinyl. 2020’s lockdown recorded LP, 1971, was picked up on by the exciting South African based indie label, Subjangle.


The label is releasing 1971 as part of a lavish double CD package including six new songs and a second disc career retrospective. Entitled HMS Blake it is launched on 25th September. Blake is featured in the September issue of Relix magazine, with his song ‘Vinyl Junkie’ included in the accompanying CD sampler."

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

While living in Japan in 1972, he developed an interest in ethnic music, particularly African styles, and decided to try to merge those styles with more traditional Western sounds. He launched the PCO as an outlet for his compositions with this eclectic hybrid approach. He always said that the ""Penguin Cafe"" concept was one that came to him in a dream while he was suffering from food poisoning in the south of France in the summer of 1972, after which he wrote a poem that began, ""I am the proprietor of the Penguin Cafe, I will tell you things at random."" He described the music of the group as ""modern semi-acoustic chamber music.""

Songwriter Joe Hodgson's lyrics are evocative tales of love, loss and life in Northern industrial towns set to jangly, melancholic guitars that have drawn comparisons with a sound similar to The Smiths and The Housemartins.

His third studio album '[m=450282]' was released in February 2010 and included the single 'Panic'. In 2011 the autobiography 'I Choose This' was released. It documented his time in the music industry to that point, including the trials & tribulations of the music industry and near misses to stardom. 

Between 2011-2012 a number of EP's were released to showcase what was to come from his fourth album. This included '[r=8861612]' which featured live favourite 'The Ballad Of Miss Lily' for the first time.

In 2013 David Ford released his most successful album to date '[m=959891]'.

The album featured the singles 'Perfect Soul' & 'Pour A Little Poison', as well as the previously released songs 'The Ballad Of Miss Lily', 'Every Time' and more.

In 2014 Ford was awarded ""Best Original Song"" at the Victoires de la Musique awards for the track '20 ans',  a French version of his song 'I'm Alright Now'. The same year he released the mini-album '[r=14832151]'.

2018 saw the release of his 5th album '[m=2814584]' via the label One Horse. A collection of demos titled '[r=22263268]' would debut on his Bandcamp in 2021.

Throughout 2020 Ford recorded new songs that reflected time spent in lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He would also regularly post free music to his bandcamp page, including the albums '[r=22262560]' - a collection of songs recorded from his 2019 UK tour, '[r=22262698]' - a collection of recordings that chart the evolution of the tracks that make up the album 'Songs For The Road' and the compilation '[r=22263034]', showcasing b-sides and rarities from throughout his career that never made it to albums. There was also the EP '[r=22256131]' - a re-recording of Easyworld favourites.

In 2022 Ford took the songs he'd written throughout the pandemic and released them as '[m=2804732]'. Some of the tracks had previously been made available for free via Bandcamp.
That same year due to the success of the single 'Just Like You' and the live track '[r=23273075]', Ford released a duet record with [a3793158] titled '[m=2939014]' and featured the single 'Warning Sign'.
In September 2022 the album '[r=24676154]' was released and included the single 'When We Were Young'.
In 2023 Ford announced the side-project [a13653994]. This act focused more on instrumental cinematic post rock styles. 

Since the early days of his solo output, David Ford has hosted an event titled 'Milk & Cookies'. This is a fundraising event where he performs songs for donations, as well as sets up auctions for memorabilia and has been a popular outing for fans. Some of his performances have been released on limited edition CD and have also found their way onto YouTube.

She Makes War’s sound has been dubbed [i]‘gloom-pop'[/i].

She Makes War's first two albums, [i]Disarm[/i] and [i]Little Battles[/i], share stories from the personal to the political, dealing with matters of love, loss, birth, therapy, murder, abandonment, and hope. Their sonic and thematic collisions - analogue with digital, war with peace, and technology with the natural world - are underpinned by Kidd’s bewitching, pastoral vocals and violent guitars, and supported by a plethora of additional instruments from ukulele to autoharp, melodica, piano, violin, harp, saxophone and three-part recorder ensemble. Both albums were co-produced by Laura Kidd and Myles Clarke of [a=Sparkadia], [a=Kid Harpoon], and [a=Belakiss].

[b]Touring [/b]

Following the release of [I]Disarm[/I], She Makes War led to support slots with [a=Viv Albertine], [a=Tricky], [a=The Penelopes] and [a=The Young Punx].

[b]Breakfast With Apollo: [/b]In 2012 Kidd launched her regular Breakfast With Apollo music nights in London and Bristol, seeking to improve the gigging experience for bands and audiences by creating a coherent and cohesive format, encouraging collaborations between bands, educating both parties on sensible gig pricing and the consequences of this. 

 [b]Stand Up: [/b] In 2015, she appeared in a one-woman show [i]Sh*t Girlfriend[/i] at the Edinburgh Fringe, a blend of humorous spoken word and melancholy music performance, sharing tales of real life on the road and Laura’s ill-fated attempts at finding love along the way.

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

The promo clip featured a big-haired Sinatra and six young women in tight tops, go-go boots and mini-skirts. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including the critical and cult favorite ""Some Velvet Morning"".

In 2021 Nick Saloman of the Bevis Frond who was ceasing to release on his Woznorow record label and starting a new label, Blue Matter, heard songs originally intended for a self release; he asked to release the Lp on Record and Cd as 'All Change At The 5 and Dime'. 

His style is hard to pin down, but seems to be a combination of Country influences, Gothic Americana, touches of Folk and Folk Psych and with personal experience often at the centre of many of the songs. Songs which fit into the tradition of the Singer Songwriter. His lyrics are often concerned with the passage of time, love and family and utilise the imagery of the natural world to express these themes. 

His sound has been likened to Calexico, Iron and Wine, Bruce Cockburn, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley. 

He says he's been influenced variously by, Roy Harper, Nick Drake, Steve Young, Ashra Temple, Gong, George Jones, Townes Van Zandt, The Velvet Underground, Pentangle, Fairport Convention, The Handsome Family, The Trees, Anne Briggs, Bridget St. John, Earth Opera, John Martyn, Sandy Denny and The incredible String Band."

He eventually sculpted these influences into what would become his own music, a completely self-sufficient menagerie of dark pop sounds informed by '60s and '70s studio magicians and loner geniuses.

Shadows Beginning in 2011, Maston put out a series of cassette albums, using his own last name as the moniker for his one-man band. In 2012, he signed to Chicago label Trouble in Mind, which released his proper full-length debut, Shadows, the next year. He meanwhile played keyboards for Jacco Gardner, joining him for extended periods in the Netherlands. Maston's experiences touring and living abroad lent a European influence to his second album, which took particular inspiration from French and Italian film music.

Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends [a=Gram Parsons] and [a=Chris Hillman] (both former members of [a=The Byrds]), the group underwent many personnel changes. 

The original group featured Parsons and Hillman as primary vocalists, guitarists and composers with [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow] (pedal steel guitar), [a=Chris Ethridge] (bass) and a rotating series of drummers. [a=Michael Clarke] (also a former member of The Byrds) was eventually added as permanent drummer, while Ethridge was replaced by guitarist [a=Bernie Leadon] after Hillman switched to bass following the first album.

Following the second album Burrito Deluxe, Gram Parsons was succeeded as frontman by [a=Rick Roberts] for one studio album and a live album. The group then splintered; Chris Hillman and [a=Al Perkins] (Kleinow's replacement) joined [a=Manassas], Bernie Leadon founded [a=Eagles], and later additions [a=Byron Berline], [a=Roger Bush] and [a=Kenny Wertz] formed [a=Country Gazette]. Following a 1973 European tour with new members, Rick Roberts dissolved the band and began a solo career, before forming [a=Firefall] with Michael Clarke. 

After original members Kleinow and Ethridge reformed the band in the mid-1970s with new players (including more former members of The Byrds, [a=Gene Parsons] and [a=Skip Battin]), a more Nashville-centered incarnation of the band led by [a=Gib Guilbeau] and [a=John Beland] eventually emerged, recording & touring through the 1980s as [a=Burrito Brothers].

Pete Kleinow began using the Flying Burritos Bros name again in the mid 1980s, eventually being joined by Gib and John.  Through numerous incarnations (nearly all with Beland at the helm), the band released albums and toured throughout the 1980s and '90s. The latter day Flying Burrito Brothers CDs, produced by Beland, did feature an impressive line-up of guests, including [a=Merle Haggard], [a=Buck Owens], [a=Waylon Jennings], [a=Alison Krauss], [a=Ricky Skaggs], [a=Charles Louvin], and others. The band's final two CDs, [m=1168733] and [r=5398239] received solid critical reviews, but Beland called it quits for the band in 2000, finally ending the band. He embarked upon a successful career as a record producer, The trademark for Flying Burrito Brothers' name was acquired by Chris Hillman in the 2010s.

Kleinow's 2000s spin-off band [a=Burrito Deluxe] featured [a=Carlton Moody (2)] on lead vocals and [a=Garth Hudson] from [a=The Band] on keyboards. The band scored no chart success, relying solely on live appearances in Europe. Kleinow left the band due to illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to any of the actual Flying Burrito Brothers members, past or present, although the band carried on until 2010 when it became [a=The Burritos], and then in 2014 [a=The Burrito Brothers]. A band calling itself The Burrito Brothers continues to tour and release music. 

Key band members included: [a=Gram Parsons], [a=Chris Hillman], [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow], [a=Chris Ethridge], [a=Michael Clarke], [a=Rick Roberts], and [a=Bernie Leadon]."

Their breakout album about being in high school and hanging out in parking lots, Please Be Nice, was recorded in 2013 and quickly took underground internet forums by storm after the popular YouTube channel jommeez uploaded the album with their most popular song, “c u in da ballpit,” holding 1.9 M views to date. After Ben left the band, Eli Long was added to the lineup for the recording of BATHE in 2014. The album was picked up by Broken World Media and released on cassette in 2015. The band took a hiatus for a couple of years after recording Welcome Home Son in 2016, a darker, more serious album about addiction and loss. With the addition of Dani Fandre, the band made a strong comeback in 2022, releasing an EP of acoustic demos recorded through 2017 and 2018 called Lost and Found and selling out both of their come-back shows. The anticipated next release, Eggbeater Jesus, draws influence from Jawbox and The Weakerthans and grapples with more mature subject matter pertaining to addiction, homelessness and finding a way out. The full length has been a long time coming; the well received, cathartic single “Icarus” was recorded and released on a compilation CD in 2019."

The band emerged in 2017 as a full live act following the early successes of soul 45 and Craig Charles favourite, Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover (Record Kicks), a northern soul remix of Emma Beatson's debut single Do It (selected by Craig Charles for the second volume of his Freestyle Records compilation series) and The Hawkmen's blazing Keep On Working EP (Mocambo) in 2014 which yielded another 45 and was widely played on BBC Radio 2 and Radio 6. Fast forward to 2018 and the band have nearly completed their debut album which features musical contributions from Portishead drummer Clive Deamer and horns-toting ska heroes Babyhead.

They made ‘The Si’s tape’ which became an inspiration and quickly a band materialised via college friends Aaron Liddard (sax) and Toby Baron (drums) to develop the tunes. The band was completed with Conrad Winchester (bass) and occasional Steve Baker (guitar/perc) from psyche band Triptych. Together they started to gig, embellishing the tunes with extended jams and never playing a song the same way twice.

They played double bills with The Green Ray around East London, for whom Simon was drummer with his brother Ken Whaley on bass. Burgin and Liddard were also Green Ray players later on. Slithey Tove quickly became a draw for their fun psychedelic gigs with odd timings and mid-song genre shifts. The band’s on-stage joy was infectious. They were soon playing the mushroom parties and pub skittle alleys of Devon, to the student digs of Manchester, as well as demos and squats, thriving in the heady days of the free-festival scene in the early 90s. They also played Glastonbury, Norfolk Festival of the Sun and Cambridge’s Strawberry Fair.

The Tove family grew with the addition of Doug Southall (vox) from ‘Blitzed’ and David Reed (percussion) to become a tighter and more versatile band, weaving humour with highly practiced syncopations akin to Zappa, with the spirit of Gong and the driving riffs of Zeppelin. At other times they could be gentle and pastorale. Their gigs became an ironic pastiche; a smorgasbord of styles that offered unpredictability and musical surprises. Some of their range is demonstrated on this album.

An exciting support act, Slithey Tove played with The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Doctor and the Medics and were occasionally joined by Ozric Tentacles’ flautist Jumping John. As the decade wore on and the free festival scene became prohibited, the band slowly disintegrated with little to show except a handful of live recordings. Conrad moved away and formed Whip the Minister, Toby became the drummer for Ray Davis. Aaron moved to Manchester to become a renowned jazz saxophonist and later joined Amy Winehouse’s band at her peak. Simons Whaley and Burgin continued with The Green Ray, where Whaley still resides, now on guitar.

After Simon Burgin’s sad passing in 2000 the band came together to support The Green Ray in Walthamstow once again, joined on bass by Jonty Bankes whilst on sabbatical from The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, and the magic was reignited. They continued to play gigs here and there for a while but commitments, babies and emigration got in the way, so Aaron suggested recording an album instead. Several years of studious tinkering later and we are proud to share the results. So here it is folks! Slithey Tove’s Big Top of musical acts."

Their debut single ""Natural Born Bugie"" became a  hit in the UK Singles Chart and was  followed by the album As Safe As Yesterday Is, which rose to number sixteen in the UK album charts. Their second album, Town and Country was released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of USA. This album featured a more acoustic sound and songs written by all four members.

During 1970 Humble Pie switched to A&M Records who released  the album Humble Pie, later that year which alternated between progressive rock and hard rock. In 1971 A&M released Rock On, and a simultaneous release of a Humble Pie concert recorded at the Fillmore East New York, entitled Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore. Rock On and Performance both went gold and the loud and epic ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" was an FM radio hit in the USA, propelling the album up the charts. 

Frampton left after Rockin' the Fillmore was recorded and was replaced by Dave ""Clem"" Clempson. Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasizing Marriott's blues and soul roots. They recorded the album Smokin', along with two singles ""Hot 'n' Nasty"" and ""30 Days in the Hole"". It was the band's most commercially successful record and reached #6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. A&M then realeased Lost and Found which combined two previous  albums as one. Looking for a more authentic R&B sound, Marriott hired three female backing singers, The Blackberries and the more focused Thunderbox was released in 1974 and Street Rats a year later. In 1975, joined by keyboardist Tim Hinkley, Humble Pie played a Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.

During 1979 Steve Marriott revived Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley, adding Bobby Tench vocalist and guitarist from The Jeff Beck Group and American bassist Anthony ""Sooty"" Jones. Fool for a pretty face proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records. They recorded the album On to Victory which was released in 1980 . Humble Pie toured USA as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill and recorded the album Go for the Throat. At the beginning of this tour Marriott crushed his hand, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a duodenal ulcer forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates. Soon afterwards this line up disbanded.

Drummer Jerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1989 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley, Shirley was the only original performing member. The band began performing concerts and was based in Cleveland, Ohio USA. This time the line up included vocalist Charlie Huhn, who also played lead and rhythm guitar. While Huhn and Shirley were the only permanent members of the group several other musicians appeared from time to time including Wally Stocker formerly of Rod Stewart's band and Cleveland guitarist Alan Greene. They developed a strong reputation as a live act in USA but never released any official studio recordings. They  appeared in the line-up at the Woodstock Festival's 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was broadcast live on national television in the United States and other countries. 

During 1991 when it had appeared that a reunion featuring Frampton and Marriott would happen, Shirley put Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley on hold. After Marriott's death Shirley revived his band which dissolved in 1999. He re-formed Humble Pie again in 2001 with a line up including the original bass player Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench and a new rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell. They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album Back on Track, which comprised new songs and was released by Sanctuary in 2002. A brief tour of UK and Germany with Company of Snakes followed. 

Humble Pie appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the London Astoria during 2001. The concert featured a one of re-union line up of Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley. 

Shirley's 2001 version of the band dissolved in 2002 when Greg Ridley fell ill."

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

Founded in 1992 when vocalist [a25416] & guitarist [a496254] met in a pub, with Madan expressing an interest for singing in a band. Soon after bassist [a883941] & drummer [a563782] were drafted in, with guitarist [a274513] - formerly of [a5373] - rounding out the group in 1994. The band came up with the name from the notion of ""being hungry for something"".

Upon releasing their debut '[m=143445]', Echobelly found themselves securing a contract with label [l19751] (which at the time was part of Epic), leading to their first album '[m=143448]' in June of 1994.
After receiving major airplay they became a mainstay of the blossoming Britpop genre. Their sophomore record '[m=143454]' gained rave reviews by fans & critics, leading it to sell twice as many as their debut, with all the singles birthed from it entering the top 30. After a major illness Madan decided to venture away from the band in 1996 after working with the House act [a24769], and Debbie Smith also left due to creative differences.
Sonya returned to the fold in 1997 in time for the band's third album '[m=143453]', with the singles '[m=143455]' & '[m=143450]' failing to hit the top 30. This would lead to a 4 year hiatus, which came to a close with the release of the 2001 '[r=2447107] EP'. This was followed up by their 4th album '[m=2117827]' through their own label [l124684] and featured new bassist Ruth Owen. 
In 2004 the band released their 5th album '[m=2117821]'. Following this both Owen & Henderson decided to leave the band, and the decision was made to break up.

In 2009 Johansson & Madan performed an acoustic set, featuring fan favourites and new demos. These new demos would later become their side-project [a3611500], where 2 mini-albums would be recorded and released in 2012. 
In 2015 Echobelly returned to the stage, performing a sold-out gig at The Scala in London. The following year they announced that a new album was in the works, this would be the 2017 release '[m=1189310]' featuring [a=3300152] on bass and [a=5766875] on drums. In 2018 the band's third compilation '[m=1472982]' was released."

Initially recognized for their Merseybeat style, the Beatles soon ventured into uncharted musical territories, exploring psychedelia and pioneering innovative production techniques that incorporated tape loops and other effects. Over their active years, they created a legacy of 12 studio albums.

Their profound impact on rock and roll was acknowledged in 1988 when they were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame as a group. By 2015, each member had also received individual recognition for their contributions as solo artists within the Hall of Fame."

infamous CBGB’s, Scott returned to London and came close to a major label deal with his sordid
songs.

Instead Scott disappeared on a rusty old boat, a floating shed, for five years. Hiding from the world.
Broke and bemused. Solitude and lonely debauchery.
After five years of this Scott went kaput, so spent some time in a house for the bewildered where he
emerged full of life and songs.
A self released album in a band called Big Top Heartbreak led to being signed to Funnel Music as a
solo artist.

The first single, ‘It’s All Gonna Blow’ has been played by Steve Lamacq on his BBC 6Music show and
Scott had a residency at the Brighton Fringe as well as a sell out show at Crofters Rights in Bristol for

153073,41703,4320781,US,Kiss,Dynasty,1979,38.55,9,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Glam', 'Disco']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

714834,254316,2301815,UK,Wild Turkey,Battle Hymn,1971,0.0,10,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Classic Rock'],"After playing for Jethro Tull from 1967 to 1970 (he recorded three albums), bassist [a=Glenn Cornick] left the band and formed Wild Turkey with the following musicians: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass),  [a=Graham Hedley Williams] (Guitar), [a=Tweke Lewis] ( Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Drums) and [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (vocals). After a short period of time, the line-up was changed, Weathers and Williams left, replaced by [a2067822] (Guitar and Voice) and [a=Jeff Jones (2)] (Drums). This line-up features the album ""Battle Hymn"" on [l=Chrysalis Music], dated 1971 in Hard-Rock style with Progressive and Blues-Rock veins. The electric guitar and vocals are the protagonists, supported by a solid rhythm section and the record alternates more pushed tracks with other more melodic. The feedback is positive for both critics and audiences, thanks in part to their excellent live performances supporting bands such as Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, Procol Harum, Yes, Ten Years After and Zz Top. Despite the success of the first album and the live band changed again, Blackmore left the group replaced by [a=Mick Dyche] (Slide Guitar, Guitar and vocals) and [a=Steve Gurl] (Piano) added to the five. The sextet released a single called ""Good old days"", containing an unreleased B-side: ""Life Is a Symphony"", before the album ""Turkey"" also in 1972, in the hope of confirming and improving the success of the first work, but it was not so. The record is less incisive than the previous one, despite the excellent technical skills of the musicians and the addition of keyboards, they churn out a good record but that has a lesser impact than the pfirst. After a couple of years without any new record production and having had other changes in the line-up, [a=Bernie Marsden] (Guitar) replaces Dyche and [a=Kevin Currie] (Drums) takes Jones's place and in the mid of 1974 Wild Turkey disband, each member takes different musical path. Until 1996, when [a=Glenn Cornick], supported by the band's historical members, give Life at the Wild Turkey's second era, reforming the group and recording the third album 22 years after their dissolution. The reunion of ""Stealer of Years"" on [l=HTD Records] involves: [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica), [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass, Mandolin, Penny Whistle), [a=Tweke Lewis] (Electric guitar and acoustics, Backing Vocals), [a=Brian Thomas (25)] (Drums) and [a=Lee Morris (10)] (Keyboards) as guest. The sound differs from the 70s Turkey, oriented more towards blues-rock than the hard-rock of the first records. Well arranged and performed, more melodic tracks alternate with others more in the Rock vein for a pleasant return on the scene. The band seems to be ready to walk the stage again, instead the following studio album takes another 10 years, during which only two albums containing live recordings from the previous period are released: ""Final Performance"" in 2000 and ""Live in Edinburgh"" in 2001 by [l=Audio Archives] label. In 2002, a collection containing a repertoire of studio recordings from the 1970s was released by the same label. In 2006 they came out ""You & Me In The Jungle"" produced on [l=Wild Turkey Music Ltd] and the artists involved are: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass), [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Harmonic), [a=Mick Dyche] (Guitar, Bass, Voice), [a=Steve Gurl] (Keyboards), [a=Clive Bunker] (Drums), Graham Williams (Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Percussions, Vocals). Again the sound of the album differs from the first two, the tracks are different from one to another by genre, some more Blues, others more Rock, passing through Boogie moments or more Melodics, always maintaining an high-level technique in the performance. The latest album released by Wild Turkey is the ""Live at Wellington 1973"" also on [l=Audio Archives].

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

Self description of the project:
""In East Germany in the early 1970’s Martin Zeichnete worked as a sound editor for DEFA, (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), the state-owned film studio. Like many young East Germans of the time he would listen furtively to West German radio at night and became infatuated with the Kosmische Musik or ‘Krautrock’ epitomised by the likes of Kraftwerk, Neu! and Cluster emerging from his neighbouring country. Martin, a keen runner, hit upon the idea of using the repetitive, motorik beats of this new music as a training aid for athletes. He thought it could benefit the mind as well as the body with the pulsing, hypnotic music bringing focus. A ‘borrowed’ prototype of Andreas Pavel’s Stereobelt showed Martin the technology to provide music on the move already existed and could easily be adapted for runners.

After sharing his concept with colleagues Martin was taken from his studio to East Berlin, quizzed by the authorities about his ideas and, fearing the worst, was surprised to find himself put to work by the Nationales Olympisches Komitee immediately. Installed in a cold Berlin studio with the few electronic instruments the state could supply, (Martin asked for a Moog but was refused), he began one of the strangest journeys in music. Known to the government as State Plan 14.84L, Martin and his fellow musicians informally called it ‘Projekt Kosmischer Läufer’ (Cosmic Runner).

For the next 11 years Martin would be spirited to Berlin to work on tracks with little notice. He created hours of music fusing traditional rock instruments with synthesizers, early drum computers, tape slicing and looping techniques he and his engineer formulated themselves. His output included tracks for running at various paces, warm up pieces, ‘ambient’ music to play in gyms during training and pieces for artistic gymnastic routines.""

This is widely believed to be an elaborate hoax with a lot of manufactured evidence of the existence of [a=Martin Zeichnete]. There were a lot of strange things happening in the GDR, but this story is highly unlikely.
The name ""Martin Zeichnete"" points toward [a=Drew McFadyen] as the master mind behind this, as ""Zeichnete"" in German language is the indicative form of the verb ""zeichnen"". Zeichnen translated to english would be ""drawing"" or ""to draw"". The indicative form of ""drawing"" is ""drew"". Drew like in Drew McFadyen. The last name ""Zeichnete"" does not exist in Germany - there are about 800.000 surnames in the German history, but ""Zeichnete"" is not one of them.
Drew runs the label [l1512693] that releases all of / and only the works of [a=Kosmischer Läufer] and he was also on stage presenting and performing some works of [a=Martin Zeichnete] during a tour with [a=Yann Tiersen] (these recordings were also published as [m=1415720]). When asked in an interview Drew explained that ""Martin Zeichnete"" supposedly is not the real name of the artist, but a pseudonym as well as an injoke towards his new friend Drew McFadyen."

Gert De Meester, also known as the bass-player of The Seven Laws of Woo, and knob twiddler of The Mental Attack and 2questionmarks, lives in Mechelen, Belgium. 

It all started with a Commodore 64. A friend asked Gert to take care of his C64 while he was renovating his house. In exchange he got the oportunity to experiment with that machine. Gert soon discovered you could use that C64 to make electronic music. For years he played with taperecorders mixed with the C64 and a cheap Bontempi keyboard. But for Gert nothing interesting enough came out. He is clearly influenced by, The Future Sound of London, Aphex Twin, The Black Dog, Autechre, Global Communication, Biosphere and The Orb.

Around 2000 he started to experiment with PC’s and software like Cubase etc… He took up the moniker “The Mental Attack” and started to make breakbeat-techno-idm. In 2003 this resulted in the “Structures EP”. A self-released CDR with 5 tracks. One of these tracks was “Doorchaser”. He took that title as username on different internet sites. But the title actually refers to his job. He works as a social worker, councelling at home. His job is to learn people how to live independently with all ups and downs and closed doors….

In 2004 he was asked to make the music and soundeffects for the space-comedy-play called “Ark” He took up the moniker “Reverend Basstorius’ Intergalactic Funk Experience”, short R.B.I.F.E…

Gert bought himself a laptop, a midi-controller a usb-basguitar-connection, etc…, etc…. And two years later he made his first Mental Attack album called “Iluvatar”. Again a self-released CDR.

In 2007 Gert started to experiment more with ambient. He was asked to make the soundtrack of a commercial for the brand “Kinto”. At the same time he began to make an ambient album, because the genre drew his attention more. He renamed himself “Distant Fires Burning” just to state the difference with the more beat-oriënted work by “The Mental Attack”. In 2008 he self-released the CD “Messierobjekten” as “Distant Fires Burning”. The main theme of this concept CD was the work of 17th Century astronomer Charles Messier. This CD got quite a lot of media attention, though opinions were divided.

In September 2009 he releases “7 Sisters”. It’s an album with 7 tracks that refer to the myth of the Pleiades. According to the Myth the 7 Sisters commited suicide at the same time, because they couldn’t bare the faith of their father (Atlas). Out of compassion Zeus put them in the sky as stars.

On April 14 2010, U-Cover Records releases the third album by Distant Fires Burning, “Build on Me”, on it’s sublabel U-Cover CDR Limited.

It’s a CDR limited on 155 copy’s. For 9,50 euro u get 8 tracks of ambient-soundscapes and drones. The difference with Messierobjekten and 7 Sisters is that for the first time the basic sound is created by using the Fender Jazz Bass. Tracks 2,6,7 and 8 start from a bass-scape where additional synths were added to empower the feel of the Bass-scape. Tack 3 “Oppression” exists only of a Bass-Scape and effects no synths were added there. Build on Me is more personal than “Messierobjekten” and “7 Sisters”. You can say that music is Gerts way of dealing with things and this album is all about things he dealt with.

British composer, improviser and multi-instrumentalist, who has situated himself for more than thirty years in the area where rock music and new music meet. 

Played in R & B groups at school and did solo folk club work from 1967-1969. Began exploratory musical activities with [a292451] early in 1968 which led to the start [a282968].
Between times since then he has been involved with flautist [a147699] in the Ritual Theatre, played guitar in Brecht-Weill productions, taught guitar and ran a jazz workshop at Cambridge tech.

Co-founder of the British underground band ""Henry Cow"" (1968-78), Frith moved to New York in the late seventies and came into contact with many of the musicians with whom he’s since been associated, for example; John Zorn; Ikue Mori; Tom Cora; Zeena Parkins and Bob Ostertag. Fourteen years in New York gave rise to groups like ""Massacre"" (with Bill Laswell and Fred Maher), ""Skeleton Crew"" (with Tom and Zeena), and ""Keep the Dog"", a sextet performing an extensive repertoire of Frith compositions.

In the eighties Frith began writing for dance, film, and theatre. This, in turn, led to his composing for ""Rova Sax Quartet"", ""Ensemble Modern"", ""Asko Ensemble"" and a number of other groups, including his own critically acclaimed ""Guitar Quartet"".

Best known world-wide as an improvisational guitarist, Frith has also performed in a variety of other contexts, playing bass in John Zorn’s ""Naked City"", violin in Lars Hollmer’s ""Looping Home Orchestra"" and guitar on recordings ranging from ""The Residents"" and René Lussier, to Brian Eno and Amy Denio. Frith was also the subject of Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzels’ award-winning documentary film ""Step Across The Border"".

Lauded for its “down-home melodies and exuberant improvisation” (The Times, London), the Hot Club has always woven a combination of seemingly disparate styles together to its own magical effect, setting up camp “at that crossroads where country meets jazz and chases the blues away” (The Independent), remaining “conscious always that above all else, the music is for dancing and an old-fashioned good time” (New York Times). The band’s musical alchemy has been described as “another breathless journey in the Texas tardis” (The Times, London), while American Songwriter observed that “the excellent three players of this band could be doing anything but have chosen to honor the greats of jazz and swing with their sound.” The Belfast Telegraph calls the Hot Club of Cowtown “a pretty much perfect country trio at the very top of their game,” and the New York Times, in a live review the trio as armed with “an arsenal full of technique and joy.”

The Hot Club of Cowtown has toured extensively worldwide for over twenty-five years, both on its own and with with artists including Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Gatemouth Brown, the Avett Brothers, Dan Hicks, Bryan Ferry, Roxy Music, the Squirell Nut Zippers, the Mavericks, Dustbowl Revival, Tyler Hilton.  Festivals/career highlights include the Women in Jazz series (part of Jazz at Lincoln Center), the Cambridge Folk Festival (UK), the Glastonbury Festival (UK), the Fuji Rock Festival (Japan), Byron Bay Blues & Roots Festival (AU), the National Folk Festival (US and AU), the Stagecoach Festival, the Winnipeg Folk Festival (CA), Waiting for Waits Festival (SP), the grand opening of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, The Barns at Wolf Trap, the Rochester Jazz Festival, the Strawberry Festival, the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, traveling as US State Department Musical Ambassadors to Azerbaijan, Armenia, Algeria, the Republic of Georgia, and the Sultanate of Oman, and being inducted into the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame.

In 1994 in New York City, Elana James placed an ad in the music section of the Village Voice looking to join a band, and Whit Smith answered it. Since then the music these two have made has always been a secret brew of energy, joie de vivre, and a respect for tradition that is often imitated but never equaled. By 1997, after founding a much larger Western swing orchestra in NYC, Elana and Whit pared back down to their essential elements and the duo that began as “Whit & Elana” grew — with the addition of a bass player and a lot of optimism and naïveté — into Hot Club of Cowtown. The trio moved to Austin, Texas, and released its first album, Swingin’ Stampede, in 1998 after signing with American roots label HighTone Records. Tall Tales (1999) and Dev’lish Mary (2000) soon followed, but it wasn’t until 2001 that the band’s lineup solidified with the arrival of bassist Jake Erwin, who cemented Hot Club’s larger-than-life, earth-shaking rhythmic foundation.

Ghost Train (2002) first showcased the band’s shift toward original songwriting and Continental Stomp (2003) is a live album recorded in the Hot Club of Cowtown’s natural habitat and joyful home base, the Continental Club in Austin, Texas. In 2008 American label Shout Factory released a 20-track Best of the Hot Club of Cowtown retrospective, followed by Wishful Thinking (2009). In 2011 the band released the first of a three-part series of albums dedicated exclusively to its roots: What Makes Bob Holler arrived in 2011 with Western swing standards made famous by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys; Rendezvous in Rhythm was released in 2013, a collection of American Songbook standards and Gypsy-influenced hot jazz in the style of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli; and in 2016 Midnight on the trail, re-imagined cowboy ballads, traditional Western swing, and songs by Gene Autry, Cindy Walker, Johnny Mercer, Bob Wills, Tommy Duncan, and others, was released in 2016. To celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2017 the Hot Club of Cowtown re-released Western Clambake which was previously available only as a cassette that the band created in 1997 to sell while busking in San Diego’s farmers markets and at Balboa Park. Crossing the Great Divide (2019) is the band’s latest recording, a seven-song EP of songs by Robbie Robertson, Bob Dylan and The Band to celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Band’s first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band. The Hot Club of Cowtown’s latest studio album, Wild Kingdom, a collection of all new songs–eleven originals and three hand-picked standards–was released worldwide in September 2019.

His approach to the recording and compositional process contains a subtle and unassuming experimentation, at times including collaged fragments, field recordings, processing, en-plein-air recordings, and cut-and-paste. . (Rhodri Davies)

There are not too many guitar-players I respect without any reservation. Off the top of my head there’s Guitar Roberts, Bill Orcutt and Sir Richard Bishop. And C Joynes.
Of the former, I’d say Joynes’s closest stylistic analogue is, for my money, that noble Knight of Araby. Not that licks are copped from that Flower of Chivalry and his unimpeachable companions, the dervishes of delirium. But Joynes does borrow from as many and varied traditions as the Sun City Girls, and like them he never descends into world music blanditudination, nor the faux-hokey archaisms of Arcadie. His technique, like Sir Richard’s, is a fuller’s earth that purifies all such dross and fills the ear with myrrh of the sweetest grade. Not many traffic in liquors this strong, so hitch that pony, pilgrim, and drink a while. (Bruce Russell)

The band had this to say about the signing “We are honoured and excited about Becoming part of the candlelight family. We are extremely proud of the album we have out together and can't wait for everyone to hear it. It's going to be an exciting new year for us!”

Thrash metal has been pumping our veins full of hot adrenalin for the last three decades and regardless of commercial peaks and troughs, it continues to be the true fire that burns within heavy metal’s immortal heart. Exploding out from the deceptively genteel streets of Norwich, England, riff-wielding die-hards Shrapnel are one of the finest new bands to proclaim their devotion to keeping the thrash flame blazing.

Formed in April 2009, this five-man wrecking crew began their campaign of destruction disgusted with the lack of a vibrant local metal scene. Driven to provide what few others seemed to be doing, Shrapnel pooled their myriad influences and came up with a sound that revolves around formidable core of pure-to-the-bone thrash and speed metal, but that never fails to keep one eye on the future of the genre too. Proudly citing the likes of Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Exodus as influences, the band have also assimilated elements of everything from traditional heavy metal to modern death metal. The result is a thrilling lesson in neck-wrecking sonic violence."

Channelling the raw honesty of rock and the skill of progressive metal into a seamless voice at once energetic, grand and forthright, CALIGULA’S HORSE offers devotees of all strains of powerful and progressive music something unique.

Formed by Sam Vallen and Jim Grey in early 2011, CALIGULA’S HORSE released their debut album “Moments from Ephemeral City” in April of the same year. “Moments” is a colourful and dynamic foray into modern progressive music, at once vital, eclectic, and memorable. It was followed in 2013 by “The Tide, the Thief & River’s End”, a dark, powerful narrative concept album about isolation, exodus, and the human spirit overcoming insurmountable odds. It received international acclaim in the progressive music sphere, lauded by rock and metal fans alike. The release of “River’s End” saw the group undertake an intense touring regime, including dates with the likes of OPETH, TESSERACT, MASTODON, THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, PROTEST THE HERO, THE OCEAN, FIREWIND, TWELVE FOOT NINJA, NE OBLIVISCARIS, and hundreds more. But for CALIGULA’S HORSE this is only the beginning. After joining the roster of THE AGENCY GROUP in North America, AMF Publishing in the UK, and signing with the prestigious German record label INSIDE OUT, the band’s sights are firmly set on the rest of the world.

2015 saw CALIGULA’S HORSE release their third record “Bloom”, their most vivid, and emotional work to that date. “Bloom” is the perfect mission statement for an act blurring the line between power and reflection; a musical assertion with depth enough for the most dedicated of prog fans, and with fire enough to bring audiences in venues across the world to fury and their voices to unison."

Thrash metal band influenced by the NWOBHM, Hardcore and Progressive Rock. Voïvod are easily identifiable by their use of unusual time signatures, dissonant guitar chords and lyrical themes influenced by post-apocalyptic literature, cold war politics and science fiction.

Founding members Jean-Yves Thériault alias [a=Blacky (2)] (bass) and Denis Bélanger alias [a=Snake (6)] (vocals) departed the band in the early 1990s (though Bélanger would return and leave the band several times until the mid 1990s), guitarist Denis D'Amour alias [a=Piggy] and drummer Michel Langevin alias [a=Away] forged ahead with new member Eric ""E-Force"" Forrest on bass and vocals. Forrest departed in 2001 and Voïvod went on hiatus for a year. The band reformed in 2002 with Denis ""Snake"" Bélanger returning on vocals and ex-[a=Metallica] member Jason ""Jasonic"" Newsted performing bass duties in the studio. 

Voïvod found itself on hiatus once more as guitarist Denis ""Piggy"" D'Amour was diagnosed with cancer of the colon, he passed away in 2005.

In 2009 the band released its twelfth studio album [r=1922763], which features the last music written and recorded by D'Amour.

Currently, Voïvod continues to perform live and still releases albums to critical acclaim. Their album [m1425025] reached number 8 of the Best Metal albums of 2018 in Rolling Stone.

Shortly after, Ollie Isaac, previously of Ossiyan, was recruited and the wall of sound could be finished.

Each new member brought a different perspective to the semi crafted tracks, and it wasn’t long before the band were ready to commit their music to tape. After just six short weeks of rehearsal they embarked on a three day session with Sam Thredder (Slabdragger) at his Cro’s Nest Studio, to create the debut EP “From the Ghost Grey Depths”. Clocking in at 50 mins and consisting of four brooding tracks which, on the surface, seem to explore the world of myth and folklore, “From the Ghost Grey Depths” is a contemplation of the dread and torments of life, modern relationships and the power hungry society we live in."

Rock On and Performance both went gold and the loud and epic ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" was an FM radio hit in the USA, propelling the album up the charts. 

Frampton left after Rockin' the Fillmore was recorded and was replaced by Dave ""Clem"" Clempson. Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasizing Marriott's blues and soul roots. They recorded the album Smokin', along with two singles ""Hot 'n' Nasty"" and ""30 Days in the Hole"". It was the band's most commercially successful record and reached #6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. A&M then realeased Lost and Found which combined two previous  albums as one. Looking for a more authentic R&B sound, Marriott hired three female backing singers, The Blackberries and the more focused Thunderbox was released in 1974 and Street Rats a year later. In 1975, joined by keyboardist Tim Hinkley, Humble Pie played a Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.

During 1979 Steve Marriott revived Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley, adding Bobby Tench vocalist and guitarist from The Jeff Beck Group and American bassist Anthony ""Sooty"" Jones. Fool for a pretty face proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records. They recorded the album On to Victory which was released in 1980 . Humble Pie toured USA as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill and recorded the album Go for the Throat. At the beginning of this tour Marriott crushed his hand, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a duodenal ulcer forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates. Soon afterwards this line up disbanded.

Drummer Jerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1989 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley, Shirley was the only original performing member. The band began performing concerts and was based in Cleveland, Ohio USA. This time the line up included vocalist Charlie Huhn, who also played lead and rhythm guitar. While Huhn and Shirley were the only permanent members of the group several other musicians appeared from time to time including Wally Stocker formerly of Rod Stewart's band and Cleveland guitarist Alan Greene. They developed a strong reputation as a live act in USA but never released any official studio recordings. They  appeared in the line-up at the Woodstock Festival's 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was broadcast live on national television in the United States and other countries. 

During 1991 when it had appeared that a reunion featuring Frampton and Marriott would happen, Shirley put Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley on hold. After Marriott's death Shirley revived his band which dissolved in 1999. He re-formed Humble Pie again in 2001 with a line up including the original bass player Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench and a new rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell. They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album Back on Track, which comprised new songs and was released by Sanctuary in 2002. A brief tour of UK and Germany with Company of Snakes followed. 

Humble Pie appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the London Astoria during 2001. The concert featured a one of re-union line up of Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley. 

Shirley's 2001 version of the band dissolved in 2002 when Greg Ridley fell ill."

[a266100] was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release."

What is certain is that Tracy Bellaries and Matt Ridout had shared a flat for a while and were often speaking about forming a group to have an outlet for some music that Tracy had written, but above and beyond that initial idea the rest is slightly hazy, or perhaps murky is the better word.

Also very much a fact rather than a fiction is that the name was cooked up at Supernormal Festival in 2016 when Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs bassist Johnny Hedley uttered the phrase 'Look at these guns, Mummise Guns' when everyone was hanging around a tree swing (this sounds like we're making it up now, but honest it happened, we think). Tracy and Matt immediately adopted it despite protestations that it was a completely daft thing to do. Thus, the band Mummise Guns was born.

Where, why and how the rest of the group got involved is not 100% clear, but the initial lineup of Tracy, Matt, Adam, Cleaver and Al prepped three of Tracy's songs and three of Matt's into something solid enough to record by early 2017 and the band dropped into Wayne Adam's (Petbrick, Big Lad) Bear Bites Horse Studios in East London to track their debut self-titled LP Mummise Guns (Riot Season REPOSE094LP), with Al and Adam adding further recordings at Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs guitarist Sam Grant's Blank Studios in Newcastle.

After that, it's safe to say things got busy. Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs took over the airwaves with a series of incredible LP's on Rocket Recordings, Luminous Bodies wrote and recorded an absolute belter of a second album for Box Records, Casual Nun dropped a couple of full-length smashers and a split with Bruxa Maria on Box Records and Hominid Sounds, Ghold released a killer LP on Crypt of the Wizard, and Black Shape and Michael both dropped some classics on Hominid Sounds and Cracked Ankles respectively.

Yet, throughout all of this intense activity, the Mummise Guns LP lurked in the shadows like a malevolent beast just waiting for the right moment. That moment was early 2019 when everyone regrouped at Bear Bites Horse, including new addition Gordon Watson, for some final overdubs and mixing. And here it is, 2020, and the proof of all this hard graft is finally available to you.

So here are six tracks of noise-fuelled amphetamine that is perfect to drive all the right people from your house and attract all the wrong ones in. Play it loud. "

In 2009 they released the Swords 7”, on Best Enemies Records, and in 2010 the Belt Party EP on Childhood Sweetheart Records. Their reputation continued to grow as they toured with the likes of Kong and Pulled Apart by Horses and played incendiary sets at the Leeds and Reading Festivals.

Their debut album BLKLSTRS was released in 2012 on the now defunct Leeds label Brew Records, resulting in praise from the likes of Kerrang, NME, Rock Sound, The Quietus, Loud & Quiet, Artrocker, Rock A Rolla and Drowned in Sound, as well as an invitation to record a live session at Maida Vale studios for the Radio 1 Rock Show.

Adult, their second album, was released in 2015 on the Small Town America label in the UK and on the A Tant Rêver Du Roi label in Europe. The album demonstrated a growing confidence in their song writing and performance, from abstract art-noise to the unrelenting, brutally minimalist riffs that first put them on the radar.

Blacklisters have headlined tours in the UK and Europe, and toured with the likes of Scratch Acid, Pig Destroyer, Future of the Left, Big Business and Flipper.

Steven Hodson (USA Nails, Kong) joined the band in 2017, replacing original bass player Owen Griffiths. Steven joined Billy Mason Wood (Vocals), Dante Beesley (Guitar) and Alistair Stobbart (Drums).

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Born: 25 May 1958 in Sheerwater (Near Woking), Surrey, England, UK. 

English singer, songwriter, and previous leader of two bands: [a=The Jam] and [a=The Style Council]. In England, he is recognised as something of a national institution yet, because much of his songwriting is rooted in English culture, he has remained essentially a national rather than an international star. 

He was a central figure in the Mod revival. As the leader of [a=The Jam] he fronted the most popular British band of the punk era, influencing legions of English rockers that ranged from his mod-revival contemporaries to [a=Smiths] in the 1980s and [a=Oasis (2)] in the 1990s. 

During the final days of The Jam he developed a fascination with [l=Motown] and soul music, which led him to form the sophisti-pop group [a=The Style Council] in 1983. As The Style Council’s career progressed, Weller’s interest in soul moved towards an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which led to the gradual erosion of his audience and the eventual split of The Style Council in 1990.

Weller launched his solo career in 1992 and by the mid 1990s, he had released three successful albums which were both critically acclaimed and massively popular in England. 

Then contemporary bands like [a=Ocean Colour Scene] were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad-rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans that had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career.

Son of [a=John Weller (2)]. He married [a=Dee C. Lee] in 1987; divorced in 1998. Father of [a=Leah Weller] and [a10310152] (with Dee C. Lee). He became involved with [a=Samantha Stocks] until 2008. He married [a=Hannah Andrews] in September 2010."

Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

Formed in the late 70's by Alan Wilson, the Sharks started as a Rockabilly band, but later moved towards a more neo-rockabilly/psychobilly feel.
Steve Whitehouse and Hodge joined in 1982, replacing the original drummer and bassist. This was now the classic Sharks line up that we have all grown up with.
The band's first album 'Phantom Rockers' was recorded in 1982 and released soon afterwards on Nervous Records. The band later spilt in 1983.
Steve went on to form Frenzy and has made a big success of it. Alan went on to carve a career as a record producer. Hodge could often be found playing in either Frenzy or some of Alan's studio and live projects.
The Sharks re-formed in 1993 with Alan Wilson on Guitar/vocals, Morrissey's bass player Gary Day on bass and Hodge on drums and released the album 'Recreational Killer' on Cherry Red/Anagram records and the 12"" EP 'Bitch Attack' (Vinyl Japan).
In 1995 Steve returned when Gary left to re-join Morrissey. The next album was 'Colour My Flesh' in 1995 - again on Cherry Red/Anagram. Other releases included 'Ruff Stuff' - an album of demos and the vinyl EP 'Sir Psycho' (Fury).

Nowadays, Steve can still be found touring and recording with his band Frenzy. Hodge lives in Spain where he runs his own business. Alan is a producer and also owns a studio and label called Western Star.

In 2000 Matthews moved to Amsterdam, where he became involved in independent music projects and collaborations, including the Sandy Denny tribute band No Grey Faith (an anagram of ""Fotheringay""). Since 2003 Matthews has worked with Dutch pianist and composer Egbert Derix. In January-February 2015 Matthews and Derix toured in California to promote the US releases of their albums; Dutch filmmakers Peter Jong and Olivier Hamaker made a documentary about the making of In The Now. In a career spanning over fifty years he has featured on over 100 albums and in 2018 published an autobiography co-written with author and broadcaster Ian Clayton, ""Thro’ My Eyes: A Memoir’’, about his life in the music industry."

Noted for their exploration of blues, rhythm and blues, and rock music, the group consisted of Keith Relf on vocals and harmonica, Paul Samwell-Smith on bass, Chris Dreja on rhythm guitar and later bass when Samwell-Smith left the band, and Jim McCarty on drums. A defining characteristic of the band was its revolving lineup of lead guitarists, starting with [a1459091] in 1963, followed by [a17827] (1963-1965), [a49624] (1965-1966), and lastly, [a180585] (1966-1968).

Their approach to music was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of rock 'n' roll, notably influencing the development of hard rock and psychedelic rock genres. Known for their high-energy performances, they popularized the ""rave-up"" style, where a song builds in tempo and intensity, a technique that later found its way into heavy metal.

In 1992, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as performers, with the band continuing to tour under the leadership of Jim McCarty with a constantly evolving lineup."

Their debut single ""Natural Born Bugie"" became a  hit in the UK Singles Chart and was  followed by the album As Safe As Yesterday Is, which rose to number sixteen in the UK album charts. Their second album, Town and Country was released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of USA. This album featured a more acoustic sound and songs written by all four members.

During 1970 Humble Pie switched to A&M Records who released  the album Humble Pie, later that year which alternated between progressive rock and hard rock. In 1971 A&M released Rock On, and a simultaneous release of a Humble Pie concert recorded at the Fillmore East New York, entitled Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore. Rock On and Performance both went gold and the loud and epic ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" was an FM radio hit in the USA, propelling the album up the charts. 

Frampton left after Rockin' the Fillmore was recorded and was replaced by Dave ""Clem"" Clempson. Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasizing Marriott's blues and soul roots. They recorded the album Smokin', along with two singles ""Hot 'n' Nasty"" and ""30 Days in the Hole"". It was the band's most commercially successful record and reached #6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. A&M then realeased Lost and Found which combined two previous  albums as one. Looking for a more authentic R&B sound, Marriott hired three female backing singers, The Blackberries and the more focused Thunderbox was released in 1974 and Street Rats a year later. In 1975, joined by keyboardist Tim Hinkley, Humble Pie played a Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.

During 1979 Steve Marriott revived Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley, adding Bobby Tench vocalist and guitarist from The Jeff Beck Group and American bassist Anthony ""Sooty"" Jones. Fool for a pretty face proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records. They recorded the album On to Victory which was released in 1980 . Humble Pie toured USA as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill and recorded the album Go for the Throat. At the beginning of this tour Marriott crushed his hand, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a duodenal ulcer forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates. Soon afterwards this line up disbanded.

Drummer Jerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1989 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley, Shirley was the only original performing member. The band began performing concerts and was based in Cleveland, Ohio USA. This time the line up included vocalist Charlie Huhn, who also played lead and rhythm guitar. While Huhn and Shirley were the only permanent members of the group several other musicians appeared from time to time including Wally Stocker formerly of Rod Stewart's band and Cleveland guitarist Alan Greene. They developed a strong reputation as a live act in USA but never released any official studio recordings. They  appeared in the line-up at the Woodstock Festival's 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was broadcast live on national television in the United States and other countries. 

During 1991 when it had appeared that a reunion featuring Frampton and Marriott would happen, Shirley put Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley on hold. After Marriott's death Shirley revived his band which dissolved in 1999. He re-formed Humble Pie again in 2001 with a line up including the original bass player Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench and a new rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell. They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album Back on Track, which comprised new songs and was released by Sanctuary in 2002. A brief tour of UK and Germany with Company of Snakes followed. 

Humble Pie appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the London Astoria during 2001. The concert featured a one of re-union line up of Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley. 

Shirley's 2001 version of the band dissolved in 2002 when Greg Ridley fell ill."

Over the next nine months, instrumental tracks were recorded, and in October 2010, Rawlings briefly met with the band in the UK, but returned to America after recording just one vocal track.  Plans changed when, after that initial meeting, the band lost contact with Rawlings.

""Turn Loose The Swans"" and ""The Angel And The Dark River"" (released in 1994 and 1996 respectively) followed the original album's success, but took the band's style further, mixing all sorts of different musical styles together. 

Despite My Dying Bride's quite evident commercial success the band never stopped experimenting (1998's ""34.788%...Complete"" demonstrating this more than any other release) and has now settled with it's own original style which differs quite a lot from other band's, even though it has given birth to many pioneers (and some say a whole subgenre!).

On June 27, 2008, the band announced that due to Sarah Stanton's pregnancy she has been replaced by Katie Stone. Stone left the band only a year later, she was replaced by Shaun Macgowan.
On June 6, 2014, the band announced the departure of Hamish Glencross, and that Calvin Robertshaw would rejoin the band 15 years after he left My Dying Bride."

Self description of the project:
""In East Germany in the early 1970’s Martin Zeichnete worked as a sound editor for DEFA, (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), the state-owned film studio. Like many young East Germans of the time he would listen furtively to West German radio at night and became infatuated with the Kosmische Musik or ‘Krautrock’ epitomised by the likes of Kraftwerk, Neu! and Cluster emerging from his neighbouring country. Martin, a keen runner, hit upon the idea of using the repetitive, motorik beats of this new music as a training aid for athletes. He thought it could benefit the mind as well as the body with the pulsing, hypnotic music bringing focus. A ‘borrowed’ prototype of Andreas Pavel’s Stereobelt showed Martin the technology to provide music on the move already existed and could easily be adapted for runners.

After sharing his concept with colleagues Martin was taken from his studio to East Berlin, quizzed by the authorities about his ideas and, fearing the worst, was surprised to find himself put to work by the Nationales Olympisches Komitee immediately. Installed in a cold Berlin studio with the few electronic instruments the state could supply, (Martin asked for a Moog but was refused), he began one of the strangest journeys in music. Known to the government as State Plan 14.84L, Martin and his fellow musicians informally called it ‘Projekt Kosmischer Läufer’ (Cosmic Runner).

For the next 11 years Martin would be spirited to Berlin to work on tracks with little notice. He created hours of music fusing traditional rock instruments with synthesizers, early drum computers, tape slicing and looping techniques he and his engineer formulated themselves. His output included tracks for running at various paces, warm up pieces, ‘ambient’ music to play in gyms during training and pieces for artistic gymnastic routines.""

This is widely believed to be an elaborate hoax with a lot of manufactured evidence of the existence of [a=Martin Zeichnete]. There were a lot of strange things happening in the GDR, but this story is highly unlikely.
The name ""Martin Zeichnete"" points toward [a=Drew McFadyen] as the master mind behind this, as ""Zeichnete"" in German language is the indicative form of the verb ""zeichnen"". Zeichnen translated to english would be ""drawing"" or ""to draw"". The indicative form of ""drawing"" is ""drew"". Drew like in Drew McFadyen. The last name ""Zeichnete"" does not exist in Germany - there are about 800.000 surnames in the German history, but ""Zeichnete"" is not one of them.
Drew runs the label [l1512693] that releases all of / and only the works of [a=Kosmischer Läufer] and he was also on stage presenting and performing some works of [a=Martin Zeichnete] during a tour with [a=Yann Tiersen] (these recordings were also published as [m=1415720]). When asked in an interview Drew explained that ""Martin Zeichnete"" supposedly is not the real name of the artist, but a pseudonym as well as an injoke towards his new friend Drew McFadyen."

Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as ""Butterflies & Hurricanes"", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.

Black Holes & Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as ""Supermassive Black Hole"". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009), loosely based on the novel 1984, and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, was released on November 9th, 2018. Will of the People, their latest to date album, was released on August 26th, 2022 and is inspired by the current years events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, riots, Black Lives Matter movement, and so on.

Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

Originally created in a haze of booze and other substances, the self proclaimed ""Tesco Value Prodigy"" quickly became known in the Industrial & niche electronic circuits for their unhinged live shows and rowdy - yet catchy - songs. Their first 2 albums '[m=1294956]' & '[m=1294951]' garnered equal parts fascination and bewilderment with songs like 'Circuit Board Rammed Up My Arse', 'There's Been A Violent Assault On Priory Way' & 'Petrol Bastard Are Fucking Shit'. It was around this time that a meta tribute act was created called [a3735793], where electronic musician (and friend of the band) [a2331649] would don a horse mask and cover their songs with a blend of hardcore, glitch and gabba (in the years since becoming its own project with appearances on BBC radio and a healthy back catalogue).

In 2013 the band's antics all came to a head with the album '[m=2453704]', where Ben & Jon would get kicked from the studio after only one evenings recording, having taken far too many narcotics and done unspeakable things to a drum kit. 'Terrible Problem' was swiftly removed from their back catalogue (though since re-uploaded online and pressed onto limited edition CD-r) and led to the duo sobering up, Ben getting into weight-lifting and Jon into writing his experiences on the blog 'Sober Punks'. Some of the songs would resurface in their 2014 album '[m=1765710]' re-recorded and mastered by [a18190] of [a28378].

2016 would become one of their most productive outputs, performing live alongside Johnny Violent at - what was at the time - the last Resistanz Festival (it returned in 2020), as well as a number of EPs, a best of compilation and the album '[m=1294946]', which featured special guests [a1119074] & [a3182717]. In 2018 Petrol Bastard would announce that the project had run its course, with Ben focusing on other musical outputs and feeling that the age of ""edgy music"" was coming to an end. Their final gig was recorded and posthumously released on CD and digitally as '[m=2957236]'. 

Between 2017 & 2020 a set of four mixtapes would be released on Soundcloud created by music journalist [a6382802]. Commissioned by Petrol Bastard, these mixtapes would include well known tracks, deep cuts, remixes and rarities the band had created over the years.

In 2020 the EP '[m=2453317]' manifested online, along with an ongoing slew of songs and the compilation '[m=1789326]'. Between 2021 and 2023 there would be a number of fan favourites re-recorded and released on the group's Bandcamp, and although they stated no new material would be created, the duo toured the length and breadth of the UK as a alt. Manatee act. Since then new songs have been recorded and released, as well as working with synth-pop act [a59548], [a7957270] of DOA, Techno act [a121782], Crust Punk band [a4292858] & [a930763].

3130265,1294946,9194702,UK & Europe,Petrol Bastard,We Need To Talk About Gavin,2016,37.7,15,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Techno', 'Electro', 'Drum n Bass', 'Gabber', 'Industrial']","Formed in 2012 by Acid Techno producer [a12477547] (under the pseudonym [a7977984]) and Jonathan Nickell-Turner (under the pseudonym [a7977985]), Petrol Bastard are a Leeds based Electro-punk duo. Originally created in a haze of booze and other substances, the self proclaimed ""Tesco Value Prodigy"" quickly became known in the Industrial & niche electronic circuits for their unhinged live shows and rowdy - yet catchy - songs. Their first 2 albums '[m=1294956]' & '[m=1294951]' garnered equal parts fascination and bewilderment with songs like 'Circuit Board Rammed Up My Arse', 'There's Been A Violent Assault On Priory Way' & 'Petrol Bastard Are Fucking Shit'. It was around this time that a meta tribute act was created called [a3735793], where electronic musician (and friend of the band) [a2331649] would don a horse mask and cover their songs with a blend of hardcore, glitch and gabba (in the years since becoming its own project with appearances on BBC radio and a healthy back catalogue).

In 2013 the band's antics all came to a head with the album '[m=2453704]', where Ben & Jon would get kicked from the studio after only one evenings recording, having taken far too many narcotics and done unspeakable things to a drum kit. 'Terrible Problem' was swiftly removed from their back catalogue (though since re-uploaded online and pressed onto limited edition CD-r) and led to the duo sobering up, Ben getting into weight-lifting and Jon into writing his experiences on the blog 'Sober Punks'. Some of the songs would resurface in their 2014 album '[m=1765710]' re-recorded and mastered by [a18190] of [a28378].

2016 would become one of their most productive outputs, performing live alongside Johnny Violent at - what was at the time - the last Resistanz Festival (it returned in 2020), as well as a number of EPs, a best of compilation and the album '[m=1294946]', which featured special guests [a1119074] & [a3182717]. In 2018 Petrol Bastard would announce that the project had run its course, with Ben focusing on other musical outputs and feeling that the age of ""edgy music"" was coming to an end. Their final gig was recorded and posthumously released on CD and digitally as '[m=2957236]'. 

Between 2017 & 2020 a set of four mixtapes would be released on Soundcloud created by music journalist [a6382802]. Commissioned by Petrol Bastard, these mixtapes would include well known tracks, deep cuts, remixes and rarities the band had created over the years.

In 2020 the EP '[m=2453317]' manifested online, along with an ongoing slew of songs and the compilation '[m=1789326]'. Between 2021 and 2023 there would be a number of fan favourites re-recorded and released on the group's Bandcamp, and although they stated no new material would be created, the duo toured the length and breadth of the UK as a alt. Manatee act. Since then new songs have been recorded and released, as well as working with synth-pop act [a59548], [a7957270] of DOA, Techno act [a121782], Crust Punk band [a4292858] & [a930763].

In 2021 & 2023 Petrol Bastard produced remixes for the xmas songs '[m=2925769]' & '[m=2931856]' by [a8051889]. In 2024 they would return to Resistanz Festival, including a fresh recording of 'Vinnie Vinnie Vinnie' on the festivals' accompanying soundtrack."

The year-long trek was the first to pair Allman and Betts, tallying nearly 100 dates across the US and internationally, and increasingly drawing larger audiences with each successive leg.
After a successful year of touring, the sons of Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts officially joined forces to form a new group together. Their first call was to old friend Berry Oakley Jr., son of the Allman Brothers Band’s founding late bassist, Berry Oakley, and floated the idea of joining them. The trio’s musical friendship traces back to The Allman Brothers Band’s 20th anniversary summer tour in 1989 when the three first met, and often sat-in with the Rock-And-Roll Hall of Fame inductee.

The band's name, Radwimps, was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including ""excellent weakling"" and ""superlative coward.""

The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles ""Order Made"" (2008) and ""Dada"" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.

Radwimps first formed in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan during their first year of high school. The five original members had been friends since middle school. Lead vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball.

The band's activities began centred on Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song ""Moshi mo."" ""Moshi mo"" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.

Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, ""Kiseki,"" and performed a three-month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March. Directly after the release, the band departed on a five-month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR), and also performed at high-profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, ""Hexun / Kanashi,"" which was the band's first charting release.

In November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single ""Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,"" followed by ""EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that ""If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake."" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.

By the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles ""Futarigoto"" and ""Yūshinron"" and top five ""Setsuna Rensa,"" debuted at number five[17] and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and ""Kiseki"" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.

In 2008, the band received their first number one single, with ""Order Made"", on the Oricon charts.[17] Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single ""Dada"" in 2011.

In 2011 the band released their 6th album Zettai Zetsumei which debuted at number 2 on the Oricon charts and went on to be certified Platinum by the RIAJ. Following the release the band embarked on their ""Zettai Enmei"" Tour throughout Japan from April to August 2011.

On March 11, 2012 Radwimps released their new single ""Hakujitsu"" (白日, ""Broad Daylight"") on YouTube, commemorating the 1 year anniversary of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.

On August 24, 2016 Radwimps released their album Your Name. (君の名は。 Kimi no Na wa.), the soundtrack for the anime film Your Name.

On April 19, 2017 while in the middle of their Human Bloom Tour, Radwimps performed as a guest act for Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams Tour at Tokyo Dome."

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band.

Jucifer's G. Edgar Livengood and G. Amber Valentine are known for their brutal beauty and fiery intensity on stage and have enjoyed the fruits of their labor as they garner an ever-increasing buzz and the most loyal of fan basses.

Jucifer's first foray in the studio back in 1995 produced songs that would be released on a fan-funded, independently released 7"", Superman B/W Licorice. 1996 saw the duo embarking on their first tour and completing work on their first full-length, Calling All Cars on the Vegas Strip, which didn't see a release until a friend helped fund another independent release in 1998. Calling All Cars..., and the radio singles it produced, caught the attention of Capricorn Records who signed the band 1999 and who would later re-issue Calling All Cars....

The band spent most of '99 writing and recording their Capricorn debut, I Name You Destroyer, and hit the road touring throughout most of 2000 and 2001 in anticipation for its release which wouldn't come for almost two years after its completion. The release of what was to be a 'tour-only' EP, Lambs, did see its release in 2001 but was available in stores as well. 2002 saw the over-due release of I Name You Destroyer. In its wake was a frenzy of critical acclaim and back-breaking touring with Jucifer taking only two months off the entire year.

Jucifer recorded another EP, War Bird, in July of 2003. War Bird would see its release in March of the following year as the band began to compile material for their next full-length. 2004 also saw the release of the band's first home video / DVD, A Partridge In A Pear Tree via AmberVillain Films. The band continued to work on their next full-length, If Thine Enemy Hunger in between performing regularly throughout 2005.

In April of 2006, Jucifer inked a deal with Relapse Records with If Thine Enemy Hunger being their debut release for the label. In 2007, Jucifer finally realized their desire to write and record a double LP worth? of songs based on the French Revolution. This album, L?utrichienne, focuses mainly on French Queen Marie Antoinette, who was executed by guillotine at the height of the revolution, and her relationship with Louis XVI. L?utrichienne, Jucifer's sophomore release for Relapse, will see a March 18th 2008 North American release date, March 24th internationally. Livengood and Valentine have domesticated the term road-warriors by becoming road-homemakers. In 2001, the two purchased a Winnebago that would later replace their stick-n-mortar home allowing them to play shows consistently and consecutively throughout North America.

They've played with such diverse artists as VIC CHESNUTT, THE MELVINS, CHIMAIRA, HIGH ON FIRE, MASTODON, MIKE WATT, MAN OR ASTROMAN, DYSRHTHMIA, ROYAL TUX, BURIED INSIDE and many, many more over the course of their 10+ year touring career. The list of bands they have been compared to reads with similar diversity; MINOR THREAT meets THE CARPENTERS, SLAYER to SLEEP, VERUCA SALT to MY BLOODY VALENTINE, sprinkled with a little PIXIES, PORTISHEAD, PANTERA, NIRVANA and NAPALM DEATH.

Chosen by Alternative Press in 2004 as one of the top 100 bands to watch, Jucifer has a rare ability to bring together fans of almost every genre. Their devotion to intensity and disdain for stylistic rules tends to inspire strong reactions. The dichotomy between Jucifer's lulling, melodic passages, high-volume sludge and brutal machine gun off-time (not to mention the contrast of female vocals alternately siren and banshee) may not appeal to those who like hearing the same old rock music recycled again and again. Amber and Edgar bleed doom, pop, noise and majesty.

Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Working with a rotating constellation of artists and musicians, they develop site- and context-specific sound projects through which to examine conceptual, literary or artistic themes.

Evolving along multi-disciplinary lines, Soundwalk Collective has cultivated long-term creative collaborations with musician Patti Smith, late director Jean-Luc Goddard, photographer Nan Goldin, choreographer Sasha Waltz, and actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, among others. In doing so, their practice engages in the narrative potential of sound across mediums such as art installations, dance, music and film. A unique artistic approach to sound ties together the different forms in which Soundwalk Collective work. Whether in original composition or the use of archival recordings, they treat sound as material that is both tactile and poetic. This allows them to create layered narratives that address ideas of memory, time, love and loss.
 
Their latest original score for ‘All The Beauty and the Bloodshed’ (dir. Laura Poitras) won the Golden Lion at the 2022 Venice Film Festival. In October 2022, they opened ‘Evidence’, a new exhibition with Patti Smith at Centre Pompidou in Paris that weaves an audio-visual journey from the work of French poets Arthur Rimbaud, Antonin Artaud and René Daumal.

Soundwalk Collective have performed and exhibited at a diverse range of arts and music institutions, such as Berghain, Centre Pompidou, CTM Festival, documenta, KW Institute of Contemporary Art, Louvre Abu Dhabi, Manifesta, Mobile Art Pavillion by Zaha Hadid and New Museum."

“I was fortunate enough to work with the cream of the London blues scene to make this dream a reality, so to now be at the point of releasing this music is hugely exciting!”
A year ago, though, he found himself at a crossroads: “I felt disobedient… I felt defiant… And I felt like I had to mutiny… I’d always engaged with the bluesier, groovier songs from the bands I loved: bands like The Stones, Zeppelin and Free. Yeah, I was captivated by their relentless rock n roll spirit, but it was the rhythmic grooves in their funkiest tunes that I also loved. These bands had soul.”

‘Gotta Get Home’ was mixed by Matt Pearce’s V6 band mate Tony Newton, who produced Iron Maiden’s recent live release, “The Book of Souls”.

performing original metal music with a symphonic and epic inspiration and fantasy lyrics.
In the summer of 2010 we added female backing vocals and flute to the initial line up of five
elements (vocals, drums, bass, guitar and keyboard), essential addition to give our music a taste
of magic and fantasy, and then we recorded the first demo of 6 tracks. In autumn we played at
Celtic New Year’s Fest in Milan (an important Italian folk festival - “Capodanno Celtico”). In
January 2011 we recorded the last song we composed, ""Holy Shire"", included in the compilation
distributed with “Rock Hard” Magazine in May 2011 with the interview of the band. Among the
several shows done, a very intense and unique one was the concert for the inmates of the Jail of
Milan Bollate, in March 2011. Shortly after we added a second guitar to the line up, that became
of 8 members . On July 11 we got back to the studio to record an EP, “Pegasus”, which is freely
downloadable from FB and two videos, ""Moonrise"" and the cover of the traditional song
""Greensleeves"", available on YouTube. After composing 7 new songs, in May 2012 we recorded
our first album “Midgard”. On July 2012 we were selected with ""Greensleeves"" for the new version
of the unsigned bands contest Rock (r) Evolution by Vasco Rossi. Unfortunately the competition
was suspended. At the beginning of 2013 we changed some members and a new bassist and an
Argentinian opera lady singer joined the band. On April 2013 we shot the new video used to
launch the single ""Winter is coming"", loosely based on Game of Thrones’ fantasy saga. In March
2014 we signed with Bakerteam Records for the distribution of our debut album ""Midgard"" and
planned its launch with video and important concerts such as the Masters of Rock in Czech
Republic, Metal for Emergency playing as opening act to Mago de Oz, Unicorn Fantasy Festival
in Vinci (Tuscany) and Lucca Comics & Games. We shot a second video for the song ""Bewitched
(My Words are Power)"" from ""Midgard"" inspired by the character of the red witch Melisandre
(Game of Thrones). At the end of 2014 we joined the roster of Bagana Rock Agency and
announced that a new singer joined the band following the departure of former vocalist, as well
as our former flutist, replaced by a new lady flutist in 2015. In 2016 we continued the live
promotion of “Midgard” in clubs and festivals.
In May 2017 we started recording the second album, with the production of 3 songs by Masha
Mysmane (Exilia), shot the new video of the first single “Danse Macabre”. End of September we
mastered the album @ Finnvox Studio and start chasing for a new label contract. The new album,
named “The Legendary Shepherds of the Forest”, contains 10 new songs inspired by fantasy
themes but also by historical suggestions, and there are 4 guest lady singers duetting with Aeon.
At the beginning of 2018 Claudia Beltrame joined as Unicorn vocals.
In March 2018 we signed with Heavy Metal Records (Revolver Records, UK). The new album was
released the 26th October 2018 with promotion and press office by Bagana Rock Agency,
anticipated by the lyric video of “the Legendary Shepherds of the Forest” and the video of “Danse
Macabre”. After 7 years of collaboration bass player Piero left the band to be replaced by Michele
who joined in March 19 and soon after in April the guitarist Andrew Moon left after 9 years in
the band. In June Frank (guitar) and Claudia (unicorn vocals) both leave the project. Overcome
the turbulences, in September the new line up with Julie as unicorn vocals and Mattia on guitar
presented the show at Legend Club Milano in the fund raise event “For The Trees” where
everything raised was devolved to a couple of environmental associations. We’re now writing the
third album.

Based in Austin, Texas, members [a6199124] and [a6199127] met in 2014 at a baseball game and formed the band that same year. Primarily drummers at the time, the two each had material intended for solo projects, but they decided to merge as a group instead after noticing their musical compatibility. 

Towards the end of 2014, they released their first EP (simply titled ""ep""), which was recorded in various bedrooms across their home state. Their debut album ""Taster"" was released in 2016, originally through Sports Day Records. The following year, they signed to Double Double Whammy, who reissued ""Taster"" and released Hovvdy’s second album ""Cranberry"" in 2018. ""Heavy Lifter,"" their third album (released in 2019, also through Double Double Whammy), found the band expanding their slowcore-driven approach into more upbeat, folk-pop territory. 

After two self-released singles in 2020, Hovvdy announced their signing to Grand Jury Music in 2021. Accompanying the news was the announcement of their fourth full-length LP, ""True Love."""

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

That song and I Love You were also hits in the United States ; Couldn't Get It Right reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977, and ""I Love You"" peaked at No. 12 in 1981

In 1985, Cooper and Glover recruited guitarist Lester Hunt, drummer Roy Adams, and original member Derek Holt to record the Climax Blues Band album Drastic Steps, and this line-up toured in support of the album in the UK, Europe and America. The new line-up soon became established with Cooper, Glover, Hunt, Adams and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s, releasing the live album Blues From The Attic in 1993 and Big Blues in 2004.

Cooper died of cancer, aged 69, in July 2008. He is survived by his wife and two children. He wanted the band to continue, as the other musicians had all been long serving (Glover since 1980, Adams and Hunt since 1985, and Simpson since 1991). Cooper was replaced by singer and saxophone and harmonica player Johnny Pugh, who retired in 2012, and was replaced in turn by vocalist Graham Dee and saxophone player Chris Aldridge. 

In 2019, Climax Blues Band released Hands Of Time, a new album of original bluesy funk, soul and jazz rock material that has received rave reviews. 

The current line-up includes: George Glover, Lester Hunt, Graham Dee, Chris Aldridge, Neil Simpson and Roy Adams"

[a266100] was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release."

Working with a rotating constellation of artists and musicians, they develop site- and context-specific sound projects through which to examine conceptual, literary or artistic themes.

Evolving along multi-disciplinary lines, Soundwalk Collective has cultivated long-term creative collaborations with musician Patti Smith, late director Jean-Luc Goddard, photographer Nan Goldin, choreographer Sasha Waltz, and actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, among others. In doing so, their practice engages in the narrative potential of sound across mediums such as art installations, dance, music and film. A unique artistic approach to sound ties together the different forms in which Soundwalk Collective work. Whether in original composition or the use of archival recordings, they treat sound as material that is both tactile and poetic. This allows them to create layered narratives that address ideas of memory, time, love and loss.
 
Their latest original score for ‘All The Beauty and the Bloodshed’ (dir. Laura Poitras) won the Golden Lion at the 2022 Venice Film Festival. In October 2022, they opened ‘Evidence’, a new exhibition with Patti Smith at Centre Pompidou in Paris that weaves an audio-visual journey from the work of French poets Arthur Rimbaud, Antonin Artaud and René Daumal.

Soundwalk Collective have performed and exhibited at a diverse range of arts and music institutions, such as Berghain, Centre Pompidou, CTM Festival, documenta, KW Institute of Contemporary Art, Louvre Abu Dhabi, Manifesta, Mobile Art Pavillion by Zaha Hadid and New Museum."

Feline toured the UK with [a=Kenickie] and [a=Catherine Wheel], receiving coverage on MTV and in NME, Melody Maker and Kerrang!, and in late 1997, released their debut single and album Save Your Face. 

In 1998, Chrysalis dropped the band after their debut album was repackaged and expanded. Upon the advice of their management, Feline renamed themselves Ultraviolet [a8018324] so they could seek another record deal, and released a single and an E.P. under this name while recording a second album. When no contract materialised, the band split. After Feline disbanded, Grog, Drew and Al formed [a=Die So Fluid], who are currently actively recording and touring.

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer].

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles.

Ellefsen started his musical career as bass player in Norwegian black metal band Emperor, but having been kicked out from the band led him to pursue a solo career as Mortiis. The music was initially synthesizer-based ambient soundtracks and he is often considered as the progenitor of the so called dungeon synth style. During the mid-1990's Mortiis also had various side projects (Vond, Fata Morgana and Cintecele Diavolui) that he released through his own self-produced Dark Dungeon Music. With the release of ""The Smell of Rain"" in 2001 he abandoned the ambient/dungeon synth style and moved into more song oriented territory and started to mix electro and synth pop with heavy guitars and also performed lead vocals. At this point Mortiis was also formed as a band for the first time, yet Ellefsen is the only constant member of the group. With ""The Grudge"" Mortiis took the music further into industrial rock direction. In 2020 Mortiis started to perform again the early dungeon synth material.

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography.

The other guitar player was [a179560], who soon left to form [a306995], whereupon Virginia’s [a306083] joined after answering a want ad in a local newspaper. The original bass player was [a778415] but he quit to return to graduate school and was replaced by ex-pat Englishman [a778414]. This lineup recorded and released an EP [m=90565], produced by ex-[a6271] guitarist/former [a70829] engineer [a266053]. A US tour followed. Des Brewer dropped out at this point to continue his career as a longshoreman in San Pedro and was replaced by Indiana’s [a747526].

The group signed to indie label [l33807] and recorded their debut LP [m=212020] which was produced by [a259822]. The album was called “a modern American classic” by Melody Maker and the band made the cover of the New Musical Express as well as playing live on the BBC’s Whistle Test TV show. The band toured the US in 1984, and Europe in March/April 1985. Next the band signed to [l8377] and released the album [m=90563] in September 1985, which hit number one in the College Radio/Alternative charts for four weeks. After a spring tour the band released [m=90564] in early summer 1987. Produced by [a241495], the album produced the hit single “[m=389736]”. 

Bassist Tom Stevens left the road to be with his family in August and by Christmas Stephen McCarthy left to write musicials. Island asked Griffin and Sowders for another album but they declined. Since then the band has released several reissues, [r=3262757] on [l212596], released June 2004, and [r=3262716], a reprise of the Ryders reunion tour released in October 2008. In 2014 the band played their first L.A. show in 27 years, the Earle Mankey Appreciation Concert. A short run of dates in Spain followed in December of that year. On January 22, 2016, [l5174] released a four CD box set [r=8080345]. "

Self description of the project:
""In East Germany in the early 1970’s Martin Zeichnete worked as a sound editor for DEFA, (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), the state-owned film studio. Like many young East Germans of the time he would listen furtively to West German radio at night and became infatuated with the Kosmische Musik or ‘Krautrock’ epitomised by the likes of Kraftwerk, Neu! and Cluster emerging from his neighbouring country. Martin, a keen runner, hit upon the idea of using the repetitive, motorik beats of this new music as a training aid for athletes. He thought it could benefit the mind as well as the body with the pulsing, hypnotic music bringing focus. A ‘borrowed’ prototype of Andreas Pavel’s Stereobelt showed Martin the technology to provide music on the move already existed and could easily be adapted for runners.

After sharing his concept with colleagues Martin was taken from his studio to East Berlin, quizzed by the authorities about his ideas and, fearing the worst, was surprised to find himself put to work by the Nationales Olympisches Komitee immediately. Installed in a cold Berlin studio with the few electronic instruments the state could supply, (Martin asked for a Moog but was refused), he began one of the strangest journeys in music. Known to the government as State Plan 14.84L, Martin and his fellow musicians informally called it ‘Projekt Kosmischer Läufer’ (Cosmic Runner).

For the next 11 years Martin would be spirited to Berlin to work on tracks with little notice. He created hours of music fusing traditional rock instruments with synthesizers, early drum computers, tape slicing and looping techniques he and his engineer formulated themselves. His output included tracks for running at various paces, warm up pieces, ‘ambient’ music to play in gyms during training and pieces for artistic gymnastic routines.""

This is widely believed to be an elaborate hoax with a lot of manufactured evidence of the existence of [a=Martin Zeichnete]. There were a lot of strange things happening in the GDR, but this story is highly unlikely.
The name ""Martin Zeichnete"" points toward [a=Drew McFadyen] as the master mind behind this, as ""Zeichnete"" in German language is the indicative form of the verb ""zeichnen"". Zeichnen translated to english would be ""drawing"" or ""to draw"". The indicative form of ""drawing"" is ""drew"". Drew like in Drew McFadyen. The last name ""Zeichnete"" does not exist in Germany - there are about 800.000 surnames in the German history, but ""Zeichnete"" is not one of them.
Drew runs the label [l1512693] that releases all of / and only the works of [a=Kosmischer Läufer] and he was also on stage presenting and performing some works of [a=Martin Zeichnete] during a tour with [a=Yann Tiersen] (these recordings were also published as [m=1415720]). When asked in an interview Drew explained that ""Martin Zeichnete"" supposedly is not the real name of the artist, but a pseudonym as well as an injoke towards his new friend Drew McFadyen."

His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768].

This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Blagden left, and the remaining three abbreviated the name to No-Man. 

Signing to One Little Indian, the trio seemed set for mainstream success, winning Single Of The Week in both Melody Maker and Sounds for ""Days In The Trees"". But commercial success eluded them. No-Man started heading deep into artrock territory, recording with the likes of [a=Robert Fripp], [a=Steve Jansen], [a=Richard Barbieri] and [a=Mick Karn].

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

She Makes War's first two albums, [i]Disarm[/i] and [i]Little Battles[/i], share stories from the personal to the political, dealing with matters of love, loss, birth, therapy, murder, abandonment, and hope. Their sonic and thematic collisions - analogue with digital, war with peace, and technology with the natural world - are underpinned by Kidd’s bewitching, pastoral vocals and violent guitars, and supported by a plethora of additional instruments from ukulele to autoharp, melodica, piano, violin, harp, saxophone and three-part recorder ensemble.

The following year, the group signed to [url=/label/Sire+Records+Company]Sire Records[/url] in America, where the single became a club hit. A re-recorded version was released in the UK in 1984.

Duffy went solo in 1984, as Stephen ""Tin Tin"" Duffy, and was signed to [l902]. In 1985, a new version of ""Kiss Me"" made it to number 22 inside a week.  Within three weeks it hit silver (250,000).  During his time at 10 Records he released three albums and a slew of singles.

1987 saw formation of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lilac+Time,+The]The Lilac Time[/url] which generated several releases before eventually splitting up in 1991.  He resumed his solo career as Duffy.

In 1999, he came across an early (1978-1979) Duran Duran tape in storage and met up with former bandmate Nick Rhodes.  The two decided to revisit and re-record their earlier material.  The result was the album ""Dark Circles"" under the name ""[a214868].""

The Skints are a reggae/dub/ska/punk band from east London, UK. Formed as school friends in 2005 at Woodbridge High School (London). The band hail from the Leyton/Walthamstow and South Woodford/Woodford areas of north-east London. They spent their first year and a half changing band members whilst perfecting their sound. They settled on the current line-up in May 2007. 

By the summer of 2008 when they toured with ClayPigeon the band had released their debut 6-track E.P. on Do The Dog Records. Two months later The Skints were offered their first ever major tour, as main support to The King Blues on their second album tour. The tour was extremely successful and allowed them to start making a name for themselves in the UK underground punk scene as well as form firm friendships with members of The King Blues.

In July 2009 whilst on tour with Random Hand, the band announced on stage at the Underworld in London after asking Sonic Boom Six who were in the audience for permission, that their debut album was going to be released later in the year on Sonic Boom Six's very own Rebel Alliance Recordings. Recorded by Peter Miles, the debut Punk Reggae album Live.Breathe.Build.Believe was released on 9 November 2009 and contains 10 tracks (plus one hidden track). The band's first headline UK tour started with a sold out show at Camden Barfly and ended at the annual City Invasion Festival. To celebrate and promote their release on Rebel Alliance, the band took part in the first ever Rebel Alliance Tour in January and February 2010 with Random Hand, Chris Murray and Mouthwash who also all had releases on the record label. 

The Skints left Rebel Alliance Recordings in May 2010 and re-released the album through their publisher, Bomber Music Ltd, in June 2010.

In December 2011 awareness of The Skints grew rapidly due to the release of the music video for their cover of Brit School Singer Katy B's Katy on a Mission. The video received over 10,000 views on the first day as well as congratulatory social networking posts by Katy B, the songs' original producer Benga, and fellow Dubstep musician Skream. Since its release the video's view count rose to over 70,000 within the month due to multiple plays on BBC Radio 1 and heavy sharing on Blogs and Social Networking sites.

In April 2011 The Skints started a campaign through Pledgemusic in which fans could financially contribute towards the recording of their new album in return for exclusive rewards such as signed CD's, limited edition t-shirts and the option for the 'pledger' to have their name printed in the album. Although they were given 90 days in which to raise the money needed to record the album, 100% of the money was reached in just 11. In January 2012 The Skints announced the title and release date of the album to be 'Part & Parcel', released officially by Bomber Music on the 12th March 2012. It was produced in the summer of 2011 by Mike ""Prince Fatty"" Pelanconi, a British sound engineer who has worked with a diverse repertoire of artists and labels, from rock musicians like Graham Coxon (of Blur), reggae legends like Gregory Isaacs and Dub Syndicate, The Sugarhill Gang and pop singers such as Lily Allen.

The Skints have also toured with many many bands including The Aggrolites, Gym Class Heroes, You Me at Six, Sublime with Rome, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, The Slackers, Gogol Bordello, Bedouin Soundclash, The King Blues and The English Beat (The Beat UK)."

2019 sees the release of Nev’s fourth album ‘River’s Edge’. 'After all these years it feels like I finally know what I'm doing. For some reason I had this image of the River's Edge in my head - a promised land where I wanted to be.'

With nods to the late, great Scott Walker, Neil Young and Tom Waits, River's Edge looks to the mythical LA music scene but viewed through a very English lens. 'There is a pastoral quality to the songs on this album - they're all about the hidden places I love discovering in the English countryside.

Born: 4 January 1942 in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, England, UK.

A household name since the early 1970s, John McLaughlin was a fusion guitarist when he led the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra]. He started on guitar when he was 11 and was initially inspired by blues and swing players. He worked with [a=David Bowie], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Graham Bond], [a=Ginger Baker], and many others in the 1960s, and played free jazz with [a=Gunter Hampel] for six months. His first album was a classic, ""[m=75355]"" (1969), and was followed by an obscurity for the [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url] label with [a=John Surman], a quintet set with [a=Larry Young] on album ""[m=75603]"" (1970), and half acoustic solos and half jams involving Indian musicians on ""[m=75623]"" (1971).

In 1969, McLaughlin moved to New York to play with [a=Tony Williams]' [a=Lifetime] and he appeared on two classic [a=Miles Davis] records: ""[m=8408]"" (1969) and ""[m=8260]"" (1970). In 1971 McLaughlin formed the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra], a very powerful group often thought of as rock but having the sophisticated improvisations of jazz. After three influential albums – ""[m=72307]"" (1971), ""[m=72290]"" (1973), and ""[m=72279]"" (1973) – the group disbanded in late 1973.

McLaughlin, who recorded a powerful spiritual album with [a=Carlos Santana] that was influenced by [a=John Coltrane], put together a new Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1974 that, despite the inclusion of [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], failed to catch on and broke up by 1975. McLaughlin then surprised the music world by radically shifting directions, switching to acoustic guitar and playing Indian music with his group Shakti. They made a strong impact on the nascent world music scene during their three years. McLaughlin then went back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars; leading [a=The One Truth Band]; playing in trios with [a=Al DiMeola] and [a=Paco De Lucia]; popping up on some mid-1980s [a=Miles Davis] records; forming a short-lived third version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra with saxophonist [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/503619-Bill-Evans-3]Bill Evans[/url]; recording an introspective tribute to pianist [a=Bill Evans]; and in 1993, touring with a rollicking jazz trio featuring [a=Joey DeFrancesco] and drummer [a=Dennis Chambers].

Throughout his productive career McLaughlin has recorded as a leader across labels, including [l=Marmalade], [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url], [l=Douglas], [l=CBS], [l=Warner Brothers], and [l=Verve]."

On November 21, 1997, Hutchence was in Sydney to promote INXS's twentieth-anniversary reunion tour and their tenth studio album, Elegantly Wasted. However, on November 22, 1997, as his band mates waited for him in a recording studio, a hotel maid at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Double Bay, Sydney, discovered Hutchence's body. Although much speculation has always surrounded Hutchence's death, a coroner's inquest ruled that the 37-year-old rock star had committed suicide during a ""depressive state"" by hanging himself with his belt after having ingested a combination of beer, champagne, vodka, cocaine, the anti-depressant Prozac, and other prescription drugs.

Michael was cremated and his ashes divided into thirds. His father and mother each received 1/3 of his remains, as did his partner, Paula Yates. His father, Kelland, spread his share of Michael's ashes in Rose Bay, Sydney Harbour. A solo album, Michael Hutchence, was released posthumously.

Born: 26 May 1926 in Alton, Illinois, USA.
Died: 28 September 1991 in Santa Monica, California, USA (aged 65).

Best known for his seminal modern jazz album ""[m=5460]"" (1959), the highest selling jazz album of all time with six million copies sold.

Miles went to New York City to study at Juilliard School. He made his professional debut as a member of [a272028] from 1944 to 1948. In 1948 Miles Davis started his own ensembles. At that time he met [a=Gil Evans], who contributed to [a497768]'s scores and arrangements. From the few recordings they made in 1949 and 1950 came the album ""[m=62308]"" (1957), with Davis and Evans going on to work more together in the future.

Miles Davis was a prominent musician in the creation of 'Hard Bop' style in the mid-1950s. In the late 1960s he introduced electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms in his music. In the mid-1970s he went on a hiatus because of various health and personal problems, though he made a comeback in 1980.

Wussy are a four-piece rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio fronted by ex-[a=Ass Ponys] frontman Chuck Cleaver and Lisa Walker. The two began performing together in 2001 as a result of Cleaver’s stage fright when asked to perform a brief run of solo shows. The duo’s first show was largely unplanned and still went without incident, so they agreed to continue and expand. Mark Messerly joined in 2002 as bassist and utility man, and Dawn Burman joined on drums shortly thereafter. The four-piece released three full-length albums and one EP on their native Cincinnati’s [l=Shake It! Records]. Their work has met with critical praise from Rolling Stone and SPIN, both of which gave the band’s second and third albums four stars each, in addition to favorable reviews from Village Voice, NPR, Washington Post, Uncut, and many other press outlets. The “Dean of American Critics” Robert Christgau placed the band’s first two albums (Funeral Dress and Left for Dead) on his Best of the Decade list, and their third album (Wussy) ranked tenth in his best of 2009 Dean’s List. Burman left the band in early 2009 and was replaced by veteran Cincinnati drummer Joe Klug. The re-vamped lineup toured the Eastern U.S. throughout 2009 and recorded two vinyl-only singles. The first is a split single on Karate Body Records with Louisville’s The Fervor, released in 2009. The second (a cover of Dusty Springfield’s “Breakfast in Bed”) is an upcoming part of Shake It Records’ newest series – Dangerous Highway, A Tribute to the Songs of Eddie Hinton. The band is touring the US in 2010 and releasing a fourth full-length.

Born in Australia before moving to the UK at 12, it was while studying philosophy in Bristol that Jamie began performing as The Magic Lantern alongside friends and long-term collaborators in the DIY Bristol music scene including This Is The Kit, Rozi Plain and Rachael Dadd. Moving to London in 2007, Jamie expanded The Magic Lantern into a quintet of friends and together they evolved a transporting sound inspired by the immediacy of Jamie’s lyrics and lilting melodies and a shared love of improvised music.

The Magic Lantern’s debut album ‘A World In A Grain Of Sand’ was mixed by Leo Abrahams (Brian Eno, Paul Simon) and released in June 2011 and was vocally supported by Late Junction’s Verity Sharp, Bob Harris and Tom Robinson (BBC Radio 3, 2 and 6 respectively) among others. Keen to focus on the intensity that comes with stripping everything away, Jamie dissolved the quintet line up in 2012 to return to playing and writing on his own. His intimate second album ‘Love of Too Much Living’ was the product of two years spent crafting this new musical approach, playing hundreds of gigs around the UK and beyond.

Following its release in October 2014, Jamie toured across the UK and Europe and compiled an album of other musicians versions of his songs, ‘Love of Too Much Living – Remakes’ featuring This Is The Kit, Sam Brookes, Emilia Martensson, Wallis Bird, Rozi Plain and Low Chimes among others. It was released in December 2015 with all proceeds going to the male suicide prevention charity the ‘Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)’, an organisation very close to Jamie’s heart.

A rising star of London’s diverse music scene, 2016 saw The Magic Lantern as at home touring alongside Mancunian poet and saxophonist Alabaster Deplume, as performing with Jamie Cullum at the BBC Proms and singing on Sam Lee’s ‘Lovely Molly’ winning ‘Best Traditional Track’ at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

His third album ‘To The Islands’ was written and recorded in 2017 following this tumultuous journey to Australia after nearly 10 years away and explores memory and hope in a world of near constant uncertainty. Musically ‘To The Islands’ mirrors this exploration, working with a new band of old and new friends from London’s thriving jazz scene, it draws on a wide range of sounds and textures, from afro-beat grooves, to solo piano, string quintet lyricism to narcotic late night saxophone jams, all united by Jamie’s instantly recognisable voice and inimitable song-writing style. ‘To This Islands’ promises to be his most ambitious musical statement to date and is due out on 2 November 2018."

Think of a Fred Perry polo shirt, a Harrington jacket, a pair of Levi 501's and a pair of Clarks desert boots. Contemporary then, still relevant today. Put them together and they suit, it's the same principle that makes Proper tick. Guitarist and vocalist Ivano Bonfanti came to London from Milan with just a suitcase and a Rickenbacker guitar in the early 1990's, within a year he joined The Direction, a hard gigging mod revival band who he'd been following as a fan. Len Fleckney has played drums with many bands over the years, most notably with legendary mod revival group Long Tall Shorty and previously Eleanor Rigby. Len joined Proper after a few years living in Canada where he drummed for The Crescent Heights. Jez Payne only took up the bass on joining Proper, he's actually a very accomplished guitarist but switched with ease and provides a solid foundation to the Proper sound. Joe Duggan, guitar, played in various bands while at University and shares a love of guitar based power pop and new wave bands. Proper are more than just the 4 musicians you see on stage, they are a team of people who work hard and believe in the same goal to bring you some great power pop for today. Their debut gig at the iconic 100 Club was arranged by manager David Edwards, supporting The Scene and they've since gone on to build up a loyal live following and are starting to take their sound further afield. Working alongside legendary sound engineer Pat Collier and more recently, Tony Morrison from Long Tall Shorty as their producer, has seen Proper's recordings well received on the radio from far and wide and has now led to Proper joining up with bespoke indie label Otto Raw Recordings who will be releasing their debut LP in the Spring of 2017.

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

Originating in the downtown No Wave scene and inheritors of the collision between rock, free jazz and the avant garde, Ut was conceived to explode the rigidity of conventional rock groups. Songs are constructed through collective improvisation and each member plays all the instruments and rotates the role of singer/director. This would result in sometimes lengthy discussions on stage between songs to the point that this was one of the things they were internationally known for in the 80's.

After a pause for 1991 to 2010, Ut is back for live dates.

Originally created in a haze of booze and other substances, the self proclaimed ""Tesco Value Prodigy"" quickly became known in the Industrial & niche electronic circuits for their unhinged live shows and rowdy - yet catchy - songs. Their first 2 albums '[m=1294956]' & '[m=1294951]' garnered equal parts fascination and bewilderment with songs like 'Circuit Board Rammed Up My Arse', 'There's Been A Violent Assault On Priory Way' & 'Petrol Bastard Are Fucking Shit'. It was around this time that a meta tribute act was created called [a3735793], where electronic musician (and friend of the band) [a2331649] would don a horse mask and cover their songs with a blend of hardcore, glitch and gabba (in the years since becoming its own project with appearances on BBC radio and a healthy back catalogue).

In 2013 the band's antics all came to a head with the album '[m=2453704]', where Ben & Jon would get kicked from the studio after only one evenings recording, having taken far too many narcotics and done unspeakable things to a drum kit. 'Terrible Problem' was swiftly removed from their back catalogue (though since re-uploaded online and pressed onto limited edition CD-r) and led to the duo sobering up, Ben getting into weight-lifting and Jon into writing his experiences on the blog 'Sober Punks'. Some of the songs would resurface in their 2014 album '[m=1765710]' re-recorded and mastered by [a18190] of [a28378].

2016 would become one of their most productive outputs, performing live alongside Johnny Violent at - what was at the time - the last Resistanz Festival (it returned in 2020), as well as a number of EPs, a best of compilation and the album '[m=1294946]', which featured special guests [a1119074] & [a3182717]. In 2018 Petrol Bastard would announce that the project had run its course, with Ben focusing on other musical outputs and feeling that the age of ""edgy music"" was coming to an end. Their final gig was recorded and posthumously released on CD and digitally as '[m=2957236]'. 

Between 2017 & 2020 a set of four mixtapes would be released on Soundcloud created by music journalist [a6382802]. Commissioned by Petrol Bastard, these mixtapes would include well known tracks, deep cuts, remixes and rarities the band had created over the years.

In 2020 the EP '[m=2453317]' manifested online, along with an ongoing slew of songs and the compilation '[m=1789326]'. Between 2021 and 2023 there would be a number of fan favourites re-recorded and released on the group's Bandcamp, and although they stated no new material would be created, the duo toured the length and breadth of the UK as a alt. Manatee act. Since then new songs have been recorded and released, as well as working with synth-pop act [a59548], [a7957270] of DOA, Techno act [a121782], Crust Punk band [a4292858] & [a930763].

In 2021 & 2023 Petrol Bastard produced remixes for the xmas songs '[m=2925769]' & '[m=2931856]' by [a8051889]. In 2024 they would return to Resistanz Festival, including a fresh recording of 'Vinnie Vinnie Vinnie' on the festivals' accompanying soundtrack."

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Citing Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Mötley Crüe as key influences, it’s no wonder that Kerrang! Magazine has hailed them as “tooth-and-nail, testosterone-powered rock.”. Their philosophy “Rock ’n’ Roll is all about energy. All about creating an adrenalin rush” is reflected in their intense live shows, as anyone who witnessed their storming homecoming gig at the Montreux Jazz Festival would certainly tell you.
The band was also handpicked as main support at HIM’s final UK show in December 2017 at the Camden Roundhouse, which speaks for itself.

Their commitment to writing songs with killer riffs that grab you and refuse to let go, and huge chorus hooks that mark them as instant classics, is reflected in their highly praised debut album, ‘Ticket to Rock’. Their second studio album, rightfully self-titled 'Daxx & Roxane', showed the world they have what it takes to continue on the right tracks. Released in the middle of the world's lockdown, it ended up on many shelves around the globe, from the UK to Japan, from Australia to the USA.
In the past 3 years, they started collaborating with world-known people from the industry. To mention just a few, they worked with Brit Award-winning producer Pedro Ferreira (The Darkness, Meatloaf, The Stereophonics) and legendary Don Airey (Deep Purple) on the single 'Interstellar', with the video being exclusively premiered on Planet Rock.

With songs that have collectively spent over 50 weeks on the Planet Rock playlist and a host of 9 and 10 out of 10 album reviews, singles being played all over the world on more than 80 radio stations, both albums have proven being worth a listen.
Hard Rock Hell Mag might just be right in suggesting that, “Daxx & Roxane are on the fast track to Superstardom…”

They were signed to Island Records and were highly rated by critics, especially for Chris Spedding's guitar work.
The original line-up consisted of Fraser (bass, piano), Snips (real name, Steve Parsons) (vocals), Chris Spedding (guitar) and Marty Simon (drums).
Snips had previously fronted a Hull-based band called Nothingeverhappens.

In January & February 1973, Sharks embarked on a UK tour, playing clubs and universities. 
To promote the band, whilst touring, Chris Spedding customized his Pontiac Le Mans, fitting a shark fin on the roof and fibreglass teeth on the grille.

Their debut album, First Water, was released in 1973 to critical acclaim, but Fraser left shortly afterwards and the band began searching for a replacement. 
Mick Jagger recommended bass player Busta Cherry Jones from Memphis, Tennessee, who joined in July 1973, 
along with the ex-Audience keyboard player, Nick Judd.

A new UK tour with this line-up began in September 1973 and ran through until March 1974, 
when their second album, Jab It in Yore Eye, was released. 
The band then toured the United States during April and May 1974, travelling in the same bus used by the Beatles on their first American tour in 1964.

The first two albums of the band were described as a mixture of woozy blues and hard rock.

On their return to the UK, they began recording their third album (produced by John Entwistle of the Who), with the working title Music Breakout, in June 1974. 
However, Simon was unhappy with the recording and was replaced by Stuart Francis. 
Jones then decided to return to the States, selling one of Spedding's guitars, which he stole, to pay for the flight. 

With Island Records not keen on the original master recordings for the third album, financial support was withdrawn and the band folded in October 1974.
The album had an unofficial release in 2016, under the title Car Crash Tapes.

Spedding continued his session work and solo career, 
whilst Snips joined Ginger Baker in the Baker Gurvitz Army and then went solo himself, before beginning a successful career as a film and TV composer.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

What they played was soon to become the first example of the second wave of doom metal, which mixed elements of other uber-heavy genres such as death and black metal. 

""Towards The Sinister"" was the band's first recording ever, an early demo which immediately got them a deal for their first real release, the classic EP ""Symphonaire Infernus Et Spera Empyrium"". ""As the Flower Withers"", the band's very first full length, followed in 1992, allowing the group to gain more popularity. ""Turn Loose The Swans"" and ""The Angel And The Dark River"" (released in 1994 and 1996 respectively) followed the original album's success, but took the band's style further, mixing all sorts of different musical styles together. 

Despite My Dying Bride's quite evident commercial success the band never stopped experimenting (1998's ""34.788%...Complete"" demonstrating this more than any other release) and has now settled with it's own original style which differs quite a lot from other band's, even though it has given birth to many pioneers (and some say a whole subgenre!).

On June 27, 2008, the band announced that due to Sarah Stanton's pregnancy she has been replaced by Katie Stone. Stone left the band only a year later, she was replaced by Shaun Macgowan.

Dale's father, [a=Jim Monsour], released several singles and an LP, ""Surfer's Choice"", (most of which were recorded live) on [l=Deltone Records].  The band's repertoire varied between Dick Dale-penned instrumentals and R&B and pop-flavored vocals tracks (usually cover songs) sung by Dale.  The group was signed by Capitol Records in 1963.  Apparently, there were frequent line up changes in the Del-Tones.  On the albums released by Capitol, Dick Dale was mostly accompanied by studio musicians.  

With 1963's ""Checkered Flag"" and 1964's ""Mr. Eliminator"", Dick Dale & His Del-Tones switched their focus from surfing to cars, as was the trend at the time, but Dale returned to surfing for ""Summer Surf"" (also released in 1964), his last record for Capital. In 1965, after being diagnosed with rectal cancer and frustrated with the music industry, Dick Dale retired from music.  However, Dale would return to music in the 1970s, reviving the Del-Tone name and performing around southern California.  Dale eventually dropped the Del-Tone name altogether and released several albums as a solo artist.  Although Dick Dale owned the rights to his old music, including the records on Capital, the old albums remained out of print for a number of years, with only selected tracks appearing on several different ""Greatest Hits"" compilations.  Eventually, [l=Sundazed Music] reissued the band's early records in 2006 & 2007.

Born: 25 May 1958 in Sheerwater (Near Woking), Surrey, England, UK. 

English singer, songwriter, and previous leader of two bands: [a=The Jam] and [a=The Style Council]. In England, he is recognised as something of a national institution yet, because much of his songwriting is rooted in English culture, he has remained essentially a national rather than an international star. 

He was a central figure in the Mod revival. As the leader of [a=The Jam] he fronted the most popular British band of the punk era, influencing legions of English rockers that ranged from his mod-revival contemporaries to [a=Smiths] in the 1980s and [a=Oasis (2)] in the 1990s. 

During the final days of The Jam he developed a fascination with [l=Motown] and soul music, which led him to form the sophisti-pop group [a=The Style Council] in 1983. As The Style Council’s career progressed, Weller’s interest in soul moved towards an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which led to the gradual erosion of his audience and the eventual split of The Style Council in 1990.

Weller launched his solo career in 1992 and by the mid 1990s, he had released three successful albums which were both critically acclaimed and massively popular in England. 

Then contemporary bands like [a=Ocean Colour Scene] were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad-rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans that had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career.

Son of [a=John Weller (2)]. He married [a=Dee C. Lee] in 1987; divorced in 1998. Father of [a=Leah Weller] and [a10310152] (with Dee C. Lee). He became involved with [a=Samantha Stocks] until 2008. He married [a=Hannah Andrews] in September 2010."

His music is primarily based around the Amen break, gabber, plunderphonics, jungle and drum'n'bass. Like other similar breakcore acts, Shitmat is his artist crossover with people not normally associated with breakcore or other electronic music genres, such as his heavy metal fans.

His music, also known as ""mashcore"", is known for his humorous use of unartistic samples and deliberate use of clichés. Since 2004, Shitmat has released eight of his EPs and six of his studio albums co-owned by Planet Mu and Wrong Music. His sophomore album Full English Breakfest captured the fantasy and atmosphere of the burgeoning breakcore/mashup scene by blending jungle blast beats, gabber influences and ragga vocals. ""Agriculture Ardcore"", for example, from Full English Breakfest Volume 5, is based on the theme song from the British radio soap opera ""The Archers"". His first album, Killababylonkutz, is an album that incorporates the clichés of the ragga jungle scene, with all tracks based on the same Ragga sample (Babylon Bwoy by Baby Cham). The Lesser Spotted Burberry EP is a wry homage to the British Chav subculture, referencing brands like Burberry and Argos that are often associated with it. During live performances, Shitmat himself is often seen wearing a Burberry baseball cap, adding to the parody.

He is also one of the co-founders of his Wrong Music, a collective/record label based in Brighton, England. "

His Crystal Machine project was also an early example of the use of laser lighting whilst in concert. 

His influence are not fully recognized by the mainstream media, but his influence is huge among musicians and those deeply in the knowledge of his career, including Steve Hillage and Jean Phillipe Rykiel. His solo career took off when he left Gong in 1975, using the name Crystal Machine and being a pioneer in the use of the laser lightning show. Crystal Machine was released in 1977. This ""Light Work"" with long-time partener Patrice Warrener, has totally changed the world of Light Shows & Illumination, with the Introduction in the early '70's of laser light in his Crystal Machine performances, as well as the introduction of Giant Image projection, with the ""HOLD-UP"" as early as 1976.

His success was followed by many others till the present as well as his participation as a player in Hawkwind in the late 70s to early 80s and who Blake continues to perform with today whilst living in France. Tim's attitude to electronics has profoundly marked the sound of electronic and rock music from the late '70's to this day, resulting in a discography of more than 25 titles, including 7 solo albums.

Despite beeing very seriously injured in a car accident in 2004, Tim is clearly totally fit and continues to be part of the touring and recording set up with Hawkwind, (with whom he performs on Theremin and 'Virtual Lead Guitar).

Tim continues to collaborate with Patrice on projects using his CHROMOLITHE POLYCHROMIC ILLUMINATION SYSTEM for illuminating buildings, including York Minster, Arche De Triumph and Lyon to name a few. He continues to perform Crystal Machine periodically, the last and most spectacular of these performances was in 2006 when he teamed up with Jean Phillipe Rykiel in 2006. It was recorded at Exeter Phoenix on 2nd Sep 2006 and initially released as a download, and is now currently being reworked for release. This recording of Tim and Jean-Philippe Rykiel sees them performing together for the first time in 30 years

In the early 1980s together with Milčo Mančevski he formed Bastion, one of the first electronic bands in the then Socialist Republic of Macedonia within SFR Yugoslavia. Subsequently, he went on to play with one of the most famous Macedonian bands Leb i sol, recording two albums and touring extensively around the Balkans and the rest of Europe.

In the 1990s, Kiril moved to Australia and began experimenting with music, combining ethnic Macedonian music and electronic beats. This led to his first solo release, Synthetic Theatre, an EP received extremely well by Australian independent radio stations.

In 2000, American label Tone Casualties released his album Homebound, which continued the concept of blending Macedonian ethnic instrumentation and electronica. It received excellent reviews from critics around the world, including individuals from the United States, Canada, UK, Spain and Japan. Croatian Playboy Magazine voted it the best album of the year from the former Yugoslavia.

After returning to the Republic of Macedonia, he composed the film score for Milčo Mančevski's Dust, as well as for the films Bal-Can-Can and The Great Water. He performed concerts around Macedonia and abroad, including performances at the international Exit Festival. He was also involved in composing additional music for the 2007 Milčo Mančevski film Shadows.

Several of Džajkovski's compositions were featured on the critically acclaimed Australian miniseries, Underbelly.

Following the appreciation and support of their music by Hip-Hop luminaries such as Kool Herc, DJ Jazzy Jay and Grandmaster Flash, their music has been used since the 1980s in loops and samples by some of the genre's leading artists. It has also been featured in films.

Cymande reformed and have been playing live since around 2010."

They were signed to Island Records and were highly rated by critics, especially for Chris Spedding's guitar work.
The original line-up consisted of Fraser (bass, piano), Snips (real name, Steve Parsons) (vocals), Chris Spedding (guitar) and Marty Simon (drums).
Snips had previously fronted a Hull-based band called Nothingeverhappens.

In January & February 1973, Sharks embarked on a UK tour, playing clubs and universities. 
To promote the band, whilst touring, Chris Spedding customized his Pontiac Le Mans, fitting a shark fin on the roof and fibreglass teeth on the grille.

Their debut album, First Water, was released in 1973 to critical acclaim, but Fraser left shortly afterwards and the band began searching for a replacement. 
Mick Jagger recommended bass player Busta Cherry Jones from Memphis, Tennessee, who joined in July 1973, 
along with the ex-Audience keyboard player, Nick Judd.

A new UK tour with this line-up began in September 1973 and ran through until March 1974, 
when their second album, Jab It in Yore Eye, was released. 
The band then toured the United States during April and May 1974, travelling in the same bus used by the Beatles on their first American tour in 1964.

The first two albums of the band were described as a mixture of woozy blues and hard rock.

On their return to the UK, they began recording their third album (produced by John Entwistle of the Who), with the working title Music Breakout, in June 1974. 
However, Simon was unhappy with the recording and was replaced by Stuart Francis. 
Jones then decided to return to the States, selling one of Spedding's guitars, which he stole, to pay for the flight. 

With Island Records not keen on the original master recordings for the third album, financial support was withdrawn and the band folded in October 1974.
The album had an unofficial release in 2016, under the title Car Crash Tapes.

Spedding continued his session work and solo career, 
whilst Snips joined Ginger Baker in the Baker Gurvitz Army and then went solo himself, before beginning a successful career as a film and TV composer.

For Nordic Giants the performance is the thing, and as those who have seen the live show will attest, it is a visceral experience that goes beyond the normal descriptors. Each mind-blowing performance involves a chosen few short films, which are soundtracked live with atmospheric soundscapes.

“Air whistles and whines around my ears, Distant echoes drift through endless minds, And magnetised to empty thoughts” 
Largely instrumental, A Séance Of Dark Delusions reflects the inspired musical experimentation and atmosphere of SigurRós, 65daysofstatic, Bjork and Pink Floyd. Nordic Giants bring a heavy orchestral brutality through progressive guitar, drum and brass, which are paired with beautiful and haunting electronics as they warp loops and end of the world samples through pattered keys.
“The hollow sound resonates from morbid tone, And aloft the music goes, Notes bend and warp as the swell rolls” 
When they pull lyricism from the human world, Nordic Giants enlist the vocal features of artists, Saturday Sun (‘Dissolve’), Nadine Wild Palmer (‘Futures Dark’), Freyja (‘Give Flight To The Imagination’), and Beth Cannon (‘Rapture’). 
“Unborn thoughts sleep silently in the mind, A heavy cushion of warm unblemished noise, The heart beats slowly in time with the dull thud of drum”

The band had this to say about the signing “We are honoured and excited about Becoming part of the candlelight family. We are extremely proud of the album we have out together and can't wait for everyone to hear it. It's going to be an exciting new year for us!”

Thrash metal has been pumping our veins full of hot adrenalin for the last three decades and regardless of commercial peaks and troughs, it continues to be the true fire that burns within heavy metal’s immortal heart. Exploding out from the deceptively genteel streets of Norwich, England, riff-wielding die-hards Shrapnel are one of the finest new bands to proclaim their devotion to keeping the thrash flame blazing.

Formed in April 2009, this five-man wrecking crew began their campaign of destruction disgusted with the lack of a vibrant local metal scene. Driven to provide what few others seemed to be doing, Shrapnel pooled their myriad influences and came up with a sound that revolves around formidable core of pure-to-the-bone thrash and speed metal, but that never fails to keep one eye on the future of the genre too. Proudly citing the likes of Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Exodus as influences, the band have also assimilated elements of everything from traditional heavy metal to modern death metal. The result is a thrilling lesson in neck-wrecking sonic violence."

A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Steve Whitehouse: Vocals and Upright Bass
Steve Eaton: Guitars
Adam Seviour: Drums

Frenzy are a 3 piece band, formed in the August of 1983, during the successful revival of the Rock-a-Billy music scene around that time. Steve Whitehouse, the founder member of the group, had already found success with his previous two outifts, most notably ' The Sharks ', another 3 piece Rock-a-Billy band who had released an album and various other ditties since their formation in 1981. Indeed, Steve has been actively involved in music since 1980. Citing musical differences, Steve left The Sharks to pursue his destiny with Frenzy.

Frenzy came to be in a music shop in Bristol, when Steve and an old friend, Simon Brand, were playing around with guitars and double basses one Saturday afternoon. Steve, 17 at the time, approached Simon about playing guitar and the rest, as they say, is history. Using old contacts and a new demo tape, Frenzy soon clinched an album deal and commenced recording on the first of ten albums to date. Merv Pepler, now of Ozric Tentacles and Eat Static fame, completed the line-up on drums.

The 3 piece soon found out they had strong song-writing abilities, creating early anthems like Robot Riot, Hall Of Mirrors, Frenzy, Cry or Die and Sweet Money. The group soon found themselves propelled to the top of their scene. Mostly bypassing support slots, Frenzy became a headlining act within a year of forming, making regular trips to London and other major U.K. cities. On top of all this, the agency that took The Sharks into Europe took Frenzy on, arranging sell-out club dates throughout Holland and Germany.

Frenzy's popularity had not gone un-noticed by some of the larger independent record labels, and soon Frenzy had been signed by ID Records in London. The new album, ' Clockwork Toy ', hit the independent charts like a rocket, and the single, ' I See Red ', went Top 10 in 3 weeks. Reaching a high spot of number 3, the single remained in the top 30 for 27 weeks. The album hit Number 8 and stayed there for 6 weeks, during which time Radio 1 picked up on Frenzy's success and played I See Red no less than 21 times. Spun by DJ's such as Janice Long, John Peel, Andy Kershaw, Bruno Brooks and Steve Wright.

In a career spanning 20 years, Frenzy have tasted the big time touring the world, reaching places such as Holland, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain. Radio and T.V. appearances became commonplace, and a deal was signed in Japan for simultaneous releases of Frenzy albums in both Japan and North America.

The band has undergone several line-up changes over the years. Musicians have come and gone as they do, and inevitably a little influence of each band member has stayed, making Frenzy a rich mixture of musical cultures. It is safe to say the group still uses the Rock-a-Billy thing as it's foundation, but also Blues, Heavy Rock and Punk can be heard. The music scene has changed but Frenzy are still going strong. In December of 2002, Frenzy released their 10th album, ' Dirty Little Devils ', an album they are most proud of. Twelve classic Frenzy tracks that have received much critical acclaim. The band have not heard a single negative comment from anybody. The whole package is selling like hot cakes. Currently the trio are recording their 11th album, a 21st anniversary special addition cd, and are still making regular trips abroad to headline festivals.


Steve Whitehouse has been dubbed ' King of the Slap Bass ' by followers and peers alike, and backs up his playing abilities with a powerful voice and energetic live performance. Steve recently took part in a Terence Higgins Trust Aids Project, which saw him contributing his bass playing to an album which included Sham '69, Sting, Elton John, The Revillo's, The Meteors and many others. Now back with The Sharks as well, Steve say's, "" I just can't leave music alone.....it's in the blood, being on stage is what i live for.....""

Steve Eaton has been with the band 5 years. He is an accomplished guitarist, who also plays for Punk outfit ' Far-Cue '. Steve has played for a number of different styled bands, which has given him a rich insight into a variety of different techniques. His input into Frenzy is invaluble. On stage he is a man possessed, and off stage has struck up a great song-writing partnership with Steve Whitehouse.

Rob Chapman has been playing drums for 17 years and comes from a varied musical background. He has played Soul, Rock n Roll, and Heavy Rock with his last venture before joining Frenzy, being part of a comedy trio, ' Stumpy, Ginge and Tubs ', a skillful musical unit who were much in demand. Rob has been a member of Frenzy since May 2002, and as well as being a solid player, provides much welcomed comic relief whilst on the road.

SikTh formed in late 1999, but consolidated their line-up in March 2001. That line-up consisted of dual vocalists Mikee Goodman and Justin Hill, guitarists Dan Weller and Graham Pinney, bassist James Leach and drummer/percussionist Dan Foord.

On 8 May 2007, it was announced that vocalists Mikee Goodman and Justin Hill would be leaving the band at the conclusion of the July 2007 ""The Black Summer Starts Here"" UK tour set, due to their ongoing projects and producing careers. Mikee Goodman's and Justin Hill's final performance in SikTh was at the Carling Academy, Islington, London on 14 September 2007 (this was a rescheduled show).

On 27 May 2008, SikTh announced that the band had decided to split due to numerous factors. The main reasons cited for their breakup was the inability to find a replacement for Mikee and Justin, as well as commitment to other projects.

In late 2013 the band reunited again.

As stereotypical visions of people and places go, the good folks of Doncaster aren't exactly at the top of the list when thoughts turn to embracing new, experimental music. Indeed, having spent the occasional stag night in DN1 and its dens of iniquity also known as night clubs, the nearest anyone could expect to come to encountering alternative music would be the ""Indie half hour"" in Seventh Heaven, where Oasis, Arctic Monkeys and Stereophonics are the so-called alternative. Thank heavens for small mercies then, as 93MillionMilesFromTheSun not only manage to dampen stereotypes, but obliterate them.

Another key element of 93MillionMilesFromTheSun's extensive make-up is that not only do they express a desire to take their sonic experimentation one step further, but they also never lose sight of the fact that beneath all the reverb and delay lay actual songs that would sound just as affecting stripped down.

93MillionMilesFromTheSun are firmly established on the worldwide shoegaze scene, with several albums and EPs to their name, 93MillionMilesFromTheSun sound like your wildest dreams and most vivid nightmares rolled into one. Their blistering live sets have been compared to the likes of Spacemen 3, Can, A Place To Bury Strangers, The Telescopes (who've they've played back up band for) and can go from spaced out Slowdive to full on Motorhead at the drop of a delay pedal.

Spearheading Blitz's ultra-chic clientele were Steve Strange and DJ Rusty Egan, one time drummer with the Rich Kids. Seeking to record music of their own to fit in with the club's regular playlist (a steady diet of David Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Roxy Music), Strange and Egan were offered studio time by another Rich Kids alum, guitarist Midge Ure. In late 1978, this trio recorded a demo which yielded the first Visage single, an aptly futuristic cover of Zager & Evans' ""In the Year 2525.""

Adding Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie as well as three members of Magazine -- bassist Barry Adamson, guitarist John McGeoch, and keyboardist Dave Formula -- Visage signed to Martin Rushent's Genetic Records to release ""Tar,"" in September of 1979, followed a year later by their self-titled debut LP. The album yielded a major single in ""Fade To Grey,"" an instant club classic which heralded synth-pop's imminent commercial breakthrough. The follow-up, ""Mind of a Toy,"" was a Top 20 hit. Next came their sophomore album, 1982's ""The Anvil."" Midge, John, Dave and Billy left in 1983. ""Beat Boy,"" was Visage's 1984 release, the band now consisting of Steve Strange, Rusty Egan, Steve Barnacle and Gary Barnacle. In 2013, Visage returned with the line-up of Steve Strange and Steve Barnacle, with new members Robin Simon (ex-Ultravox guitarist) and Lauren Duvall (on vocals).

Australian poet, guitarist, singer, composer and performance artist [a=Daevid Allen] moved to Paris in 1960. Inspired by the emerging 'Beat Generation' of writer's works he'd discovered whilst working in a Melbourne bookshop he moved into a room in Paris's 'Beat Hotel' and spent time around the city's Latin Quarter. There, he rubbed shoulders with [a=Terry Riley] and [a=William S. Burroughs], gaining free access to the area's jazz clubs. Influenced by the music philosophies of [a=Sun Ra] he formed the [a=Daevid Allen Trio], a free-jazz outfit which performed in Burroughs' theatre pieces based on that writer's novel 'The Ticket That Exploded'. 

In 1961 Allen travelled to Canterbury, England, where he met 16 year-old [a=Robert Wyatt] (who was the son of his landlord). Their mutual interest in jazz resulted in a few gigs, in London in 1963, as the Daevid Allen Trio (with [a=Hugh Hopper] on bass and [a=Mike Ratledge] occasionally guesting on piano). Around the same time, Wyatt formed the [b][a=Wilde Flowers][/b] with the Hopper brothers, Hugh and Brian Hopper, with [a=Kevin Ayers] on vocals.

The impetus behind the formation of [a=Soft Machine] occurred in a meeting of Daevid Allen and Kevin Ayers with Texan millionaire Wes Brunson in Deya, Majorca, on Easter Sunday 1966. Brunson agreed to put up the money for a new band, which allowed the group to buy equipment and rent a rehearsal room near Canterbury. The original line-up consisted of Robert Wyatt on drums and vocals, Mike Ratledge on keyboards, Daevid Allen on guitar and Kevin Ayers on bass and vocals. From May 1966 they gigged as Mister Head (aka Mr Head) and became [b]Soft Machine[/b] in August 1966.

The name was taken from a William S. Burroughs novel 'The Soft Machine' (part of The Nova Trilogy), with agreement from the author. The title The Soft Machine encapsulates the Human Body, and the main theme of the book - as explicitly written in an appendix - concerns how control mechanisms invade the body. One poem, entitled Mens (Man, as in 'human'), by Dutch-American hematologist and poet Leo Vroman starts with the line: ""Man is a soft machine...""

Mike Ratledge says of this : ""... Soft machine was a generic term for the whole of humanity, and we were all soft machines... I guess our basic assumption was that what we liked, everybody else was going to like as well, that we all had things in common, and therefore we all are soft machines, and we were all going to like Soft Machine music. It might have been a false assumption, but I hope it's true"".

In January 1967, the band's first single release, [i][b][m16803][/b][/i], was recorded.. Celebrating its release on February 22nd 1967 the band gave a press conference at The Speakeasy, performing that evening at The Roundhouse as the opening act for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience] - where Hendrix jammed with them on bass. 

Allen recalls their introduction to The Speakeasy by [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], the promoter, producer, founder of the Crawdaddy Club and original manager of both [a=The Yardbirds] and [a=the Rolling Stones]; “He would take us there and ply us with whiskeys on the expense account. We’d meet all the big stars at the time. It was like being at court, only a rock ‘n’ roll court. ‘Cause [a=the Beatles] were there, the Rolling Stones were there – everybody, all the big names, would gather at the Speakeasy at this particular time.” [From the book 'Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous' by Graham Bennett].

Three months later, a collection of demos was recorded at DeLane Lea Studios with producer [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], but not officially released until 1971 as two compilations on the French [l=BYG Records] label. At that time, Soft Machine had already become something of a 'cult' band on the London psychedelic scene, gigging at places like the Zebra Club, The Marquee, The Roundhouse, UFO (Underground Freak Out club) and Middle Earth. Light shows were also developed with Mark Boyle's Sensual Laboratory. On April 29th, 1967, they took part in the '14 Hour Technicolor Dream', an event set up by the underground paper 'International Times', which also featured [a=Pink Floyd], [a=the Move], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Crazy World of Arthur Brown], [a=Tomorrow (2)], [a=Mothers of Invention], [a=Velvet Underground] and artists such as [a=Alan Ginsberg] and [a=Yoko Ono].

During the summer of 1967 the band toured France, performing at psychedelic events along the Cote d’Azur such as [a=Jean-Jacques Lebel]’s “Sunlove Happening” and [l=Eddie Barclay]’s “La Nuit Pschedelique”. For three weeks they provided daily musical “transmissions hallucinatoires” for wildly popular performances of “Le Désir Attrapé par la Queue”, a Pablo Picasso play produced by Lebel at the Festival de la Libre Expression outside Saint-Tropez. A legendary performance of “Do It Again” helped Soft Machine to make an enormous impression in France and, by the end of the Summer of Love, they became the favorite band of the French avant-garde. 

On the way back Daevid Allen was refused re-entry to England and stayed in France, moving on to various projects before forming [a=Gong] two years later, while Robert Wyatt, Mike Ratledge and Kevin Ayers decided to carry on Soft Machine as a trio.

In February 1968, Soft Machine embarked on a three month US tour (opening for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience]), recording their first album during their touring schedule in New York in four days in April 1968, with production handled by Tom Wilson and former [a=Animals] bassist and Hendrix producer [a=Chas Chandler]. Although quickly made and not particularly well-recorded, the band's eponymous album [i][b][m=16766][/b][/i] (1968) is now considered a classic of the extraordinarily creative post-psychedelic and pre-progressive period of the late 1960's.

The band split up in December 1968, re-formed in February 1969 and carried on until the late 1970's through many line-up changes and leaving no original member onboard. It re-formed briefly in 1980 and 1984. Robert Wyatt formed [b][a=Matching Mole][/b] in October 1971. ""Matching Mole"" is a clever mis-pronounciation of ""La Machine Molle"", the French title of William Burroughs' novel ""The Soft Machine"".

158676,35090,393177,UK,Nico (3),Behind The Iron Curtain,1986,0.0,16,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Avantgarde'],"Nico was a German singer, songwriter, musician, model and actress, born in Köln (Cologne) on 18 October 1938. She died in a bicycle accident on Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Spain, on 18 July 1988. According to her autobiography, her Catholic father Wilhelm Päffgen was an archeologist, stemming from a wealthy Bavarian brew master dynasty. But that can´t be correct: Gisela Päffgen proved that there wasn´t any relative named ""Wilhelm Päffgen"" - but an employee called ""Hermann Willhelm Päffgen"". Nico´s father died in WWII in 1942, and her mother Margarete (née Schulze, 1910-70) moved to Berlin-Schöneberg. Due to the heavy bombings, they soon moved again, to Lübbenau in Brandenburg, a small town in the eastern part of Germany.

After the war, mother and daughter moved to Berlin where Nico, aged 15 and already 175 cm (5'9"") tall, was discovered by photographer Herbert Tobias while she worked as a sales person at the KaDeWe department store. He supposedly gave her the nickname Nico after his lover, the Greek movie maker Nikos Papatakis. At first, she called herself both Christa Nico and Nico Otzak, but settled for Nico. The modelling career soon set off for the statuesque brunette-turned-blonde, which allowed her to work in Berlin, Paris, London and Rome. Already in the late 1950s she had an unprecedented modelling career for a German (with a contract with the Eileen Ford Agency), which enabled her to buy a house for her mother (already suffering from Parkinson's) on Ibiza in 1962. And it was in Rome where she had her first movie appearance as 'Nico' in [a463623]'s 'La dolce vita'. In 1959 she moved to Paris where she had an affair with [a=Alain Delon] and in 1962 gave birth to her only son, the troubled [a949333] whose father never acknowledged him.

In London she met [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Brian+Jones+(5)]Brian Jones[/url] and recorded her first single [r1171100], produced by Rolling Stones manager [a=Andrew Loog Oldham]. While modeling in New York, [a=Bob Dylan] introduced her to [a=Andy Warhol] and [a39766]. She sang three songs on the Velvet Underground's debut LP and played roles in several Warhol films. Following the release of her debut album, [m35096], her friend [a=Jim Morrison] encouraged her to write her own material.

She toured extensively in Europe, United States, Australia and Japan in the 1980s. After a concert in Berlin in June 1988, she went on holiday in Ibiza to rest.

Vega began his career as a visual artist, gaining notoriety for his ""light sculptures"" eventually opened his own lower Manhattan gallery space, which he dubbed the Project of Living Artists. The Project served as a stomping grounds for the likes of the New York Dolls, Television and Blondie as well as the 15-piece jazz group Reverend B., which featured a musician named Martin Rev on electric piano. Soon, Vega and Rev formed Suicide, whose minimalist, aggressive music - a fusion of Rev's ominous, repetitive keyboards and Vega's rockabilly snarl - helped pave the direction for the electronic artists of the future. 

Suicide disbanded in 1980, and both Vega and Rev undertook solo careers. Vega's self-titled 1980 debut and his 1981 effort Collision Drive continued to explore the fractured rockabilly identity he had established in his earlier work. 1983's Saturn Strip, produced by longtime fan Ric Ocasek, marked Vega's debut for Elektra Records; corporate relations soured during production for 1985's Just A Million Dreams, however, and at one point the label even attempted to remove the singer from his own studio sessions. Vega teamed up with Martin Rev and Ric Ocasek again in the late eighties to produce and release the third Suicide album, A Way of Life (1988). Shortly thereafter, Vega met future wife and music partner Elizabeth Lamere while piecing together sound experiments that would evolve into his fifth solo album, Deuce Avenue (1990). Deuce Avenue marked his return to minimalist electronic music, similar to his work with Suicide, in which he combined drum machines and effects with free-form prose. 

Over the next several decades he would release several more solo records and perform and release albums with Suicide. In 2012, Vega suffered a stroke. That, and problems with his knees, led him to focus on less physically demanding art, such as painting, however, he continued to perform at selected concerts and work on the music that led to his final studio album 'IT', which was released posthumously on July 14 on Fader. The album was produced by Alan Vega, Liz Lamere, Perkin Barnes and Jared Artaud of New York City band The Vacant Lots. 

The album cover and inner sleeves featured Vega's original artwork. Two posthumous art shows ""Dream Baby Dream"" at Deitch Gallery and ""Keep IT Alive"" at Invisible-Exports exhibited Alan Vega's work in New York City. In 2021, Sacred Bones Records releases 'Mutator', the lost Alan Vega album produced and mixed by Liz Lamere and Jared Artaud, the first in a series of unreleased and rare material from the Vega Vault. Vega had died in his sleep on July 16, 2016, at the age of 78."

Crywank started in 2009 with Jay Clayton attempting to do some folk-punk influenced acoustic music with no previous experience playing guitar. The first album ""James is going to die soon"" was inspired by a painful break up. Jay stated that ""I wrote these songs out of frustration and sadness and they ended up making me feel a lot better, I hope they have a similar effect on you"".

In 2012 Crywank released their second album 'Narcissist On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown'. Described as ""a collection of paranoid songs mostly about me trying to understand my own sadness along with the concept of sadness as a whole. It was fuelled by self help books and pot.""

In late 2012 Dan Watson joined Crywank on percussion, and in early 2013 they released tour demos for their third album 'Tomorrow Is Nearly Yesterday And Everyday Is Stupid' which was released in October 2013.

Since 2013, the band has expanded their discography to a total of 8 albums, including 2016's 'Don't Piss On Me, I'm Already Dead' and what was slated to be their final album, 2020's 'Fist Me 'til Your Hand Comes Out My Mouth'. The band announced their breakup in 2020 and are planning on completing their history together after their final worldwide tour."

Ellefsen started his musical career as bass player in Norwegian black metal band Emperor, but having been kicked out from the band led him to pursue a solo career as Mortiis. The music was initially synthesizer-based ambient soundtracks and he is often considered as the progenitor of the so called dungeon synth style. During the mid-1990's Mortiis also had various side projects (Vond, Fata Morgana and Cintecele Diavolui) that he released through his own self-produced Dark Dungeon Music. With the release of ""The Smell of Rain"" in 2001 he abandoned the ambient/dungeon synth style and moved into more song oriented territory and started to mix electro and synth pop with heavy guitars and also performed lead vocals. At this point Mortiis was also formed as a band for the first time, yet Ellefsen is the only constant member of the group. With ""The Grudge"" Mortiis took the music further into industrial rock direction. In 2020 Mortiis started to perform again the early dungeon synth material.

Formed in 1998 by Neil Jones and Neil Sheasby, the band started with a deep love for Northern soul and Motown, which led them to create a sound that pays homage to their influences while carving out their unique voice in modern soul. With a tight rhythm section, brass-heavy arrangements, and rich vocal harmonies, Stone Foundation quickly gained a reputation for their electrifying live performances. Their early albums, like To Find the Spirit, laid the groundwork for a growing fan base and industry respect, setting them apart as torchbearers of authentic British soul.
In recent years, Stone Foundation has collaborated with a range of prominent musicians, most notably Paul Weller, who has contributed to and produced several of their tracks. Albums such as Street Rituals and Everybody, Anyone showcase the band’s evolving sound, blending socially aware themes with a soulful optimism that resonates with audiences across generations. With each release, Stone Foundation continues to expand their influence, merging classic soul textures with modern sensibilities and solidifying their place in the UK’s contemporary music landscape.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

Thrash metal band influenced by the NWOBHM, Hardcore and Progressive Rock. Voïvod are easily identifiable by their use of unusual time signatures, dissonant guitar chords and lyrical themes influenced by post-apocalyptic literature, cold war politics and science fiction.

Founding members Jean-Yves Thériault alias [a=Blacky (2)] (bass) and Denis Bélanger alias [a=Snake (6)] (vocals) departed the band in the early 1990s (though Bélanger would return and leave the band several times until the mid 1990s), guitarist Denis D'Amour alias [a=Piggy] and drummer Michel Langevin alias [a=Away] forged ahead with new member Eric ""E-Force"" Forrest on bass and vocals. Forrest departed in 2001 and Voïvod went on hiatus for a year. The band reformed in 2002 with Denis ""Snake"" Bélanger returning on vocals and ex-[a=Metallica] member Jason ""Jasonic"" Newsted performing bass duties in the studio. 

Voïvod found itself on hiatus once more as guitarist Denis ""Piggy"" D'Amour was diagnosed with cancer of the colon, he passed away in 2005.

In 2009 the band released its twelfth studio album [r=1922763], which features the last music written and recorded by D'Amour.

Currently, Voïvod continues to perform live and still releases albums to critical acclaim. Their album [m1425025] reached number 8 of the Best Metal albums of 2018 in Rolling Stone.

Founded as ""The Earwigs"" in the spring of 1964, the group featured [a=Vincent Furnier] [later known as [a=Alice Cooper (2)]] on vocals,  [a=Dennis Dunaway] on bass, and [a=Glen Buxton] on guitar. They were shortly after joined by [a=John Tatum] on rhythm guitar and [a=John Speer] on drums and became [a=Spiders] in the fall of 1965. [a=Michael Bruce] replaced Tatum on guitar in 1966. The band relocated to Los Angeles in March 1967, changed their name to [a=The Nazz] in April. Fellow Phoenix musician and friend [a=Neal Smith] moved in with the band in September 1967 and replaced Speer as drummer later that fall. By March of 1968 the band changed their name again, becoming [a=Alice Cooper] to prevent confusion with [a=Todd Rundgren]'s group [a=Nazz].

Lead singer Furnier took on the identity of Alice Cooper onstage and the band went on to become one of the most popular rock bands of the early seventies.  Their overblown stage presence basically created shock rock and was hugely influential on the rock scene that followed.

The band split in 1974, initially taking a hiatus with several members working on solo projects.  Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper in 1975, and launched a successful solo career.  Bruce, Dunaway and Smith went on to form [a=Billion Dollar Babies], named after the most popular Alice Cooper album."

The group has no permanent group line-up, and Johnson has collaborated with a wide range of musicians, changing personnel from project to project.
The The began recording in 1979/1980 and released their first single “Controversial Subject” in 1980. The first album release came in 1983, the critically acclaimed “Soul Mining"", which featured guest appearances from [a=Orange Juice (3)] drummer [a=Zeke Manyika], [a=Jools Holland], [a=Thomas Leer] and [a15025].
Johnson followed with a new album entitled “Infected” in 1986, recording again with Zeke Manyika, plus singer [a=Neneh Cherry], and a number of session musicians. Four singles were released from the album, with ""Heartland"" being the most successful, reaching 29 in the UK Chart. The album was accompanied by a full length video “Infected: The Movie” which was shot on location in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Johnson toured the world extensively with the movie. 
In 1988, Johnson re-formed The The as a four piece band, having recruited ex-[a=The Smiths] guitarist [a=Johnny Marr], bassist [a=James Eller] and former [a=ABC] drummer [a=David Palmer] as full time band members. This line-up recorded the album “Mind Bomb”, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and featured the band's highest charting single to that time, ""The Beat(en) Generation"" hitting 18 in the UK chart.
In 1989 keyboard player [a=D.C. Collard] was added to the line-up and the band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called “The The Versus The World”, culminating in three sold out gigs at London's Royal Albert Hall at the end of the tour. 
In 1990 the studio EP “Shades of Blue” was released. 
In 1993, the five-piece line-up (Johnson/Marr/Collard/Eller/Palmer) recorded The The’s fourth album “Dusk”, which debuted at No. 2 in the UK. Another world tour followed, the “Lonely Planet” tour. Johnson relocated the band to America, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by guitarist [a=Keith Joyner] and bassist [a=Jared Michael Nickerson]. Harmonica player [a=Jim Fitting] (formerly of [a=Treat Her Right]) joined the band in early 1993. Palmer left the band partway through the tour and was replaced by ex-[a=Stabbing Westward] drummer [a=Andy Kubiszewski]. The reshuffled band headlined the main stage at the 1993 Reading Festival.
Johnson then permanently relocated to New York, and The The's next project was 1995's “Hanky Panky”, an album that consisted entirely of [a=Hank Williams] cover versions. “Hanky Panky” was recorded by a new The The group, this time consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, guitarist [a=Eric Schermerhorn], bass guitarist [a=Gail Ann Dorsey], and drummer [a=Brian MacLeod]. Their cover version of ""I Saw The Light"" hit No. 31 in the UK chart.
In 2000, The The, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, bassist [a=Spencer Campbell] and drummer [a=Earl Harvin], released its sixth album “NakedSelf” and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour, “The Naked Tour”, lasting 14 months. “NakedSelf” remains The The's final released studio album to date.
Since 2003 the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations.
In April 2014 The The announced that on June 30th 2014 a re-mastered, re-packaged version of ""Soul Mining"" would be released to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of its original release.

The album garnered awards and critical acclaim from Rolling Stone, American Songwriter, NPR and countless others. His follow-up album, “Tenderheart,” gave Outlaw his first foray into self-producing and further evolved his “SoCal Country” sound by introducing more elements of Pop and Rock music. Also a critical success, “Tenderheart” was heralded as one of the year’s best country albums, supported by a full tour of North America and dozens of shows in Europe."

Founded in the beginning of the 1980's as pure rockabilly band

Long before terms like Psychobilly and Neorockabilly became common , The Deltas had already started spreading their own brand of high-energy Rock`n´Roll. The original lineup was Steve Bongo (vocals, drums), Captain Pat Marvel (guitar) and Little John (bass) and the trio recorded a demo tape in 1980, loaded with 50´s Rockabilly obscurities like Who Told You?, My Babe or Your Wildcat Ways. A year later they'd already got quite a reputation to be one of the wildest live acts and most talented rocking bands out there. Roy Williams, who had just started his own record company, contracted the Deltas and recorded the now classic Boogie Disease album with them in the Pathway Studios. He introduced them on the back sleeve of the longplayer as ""-wilder than the Polecats-crazier than The Meteors"". The album sold well and The Deltas became very busy touring the UK and the rest of Europe, playing small clubs as well as some of the big RnR weekenders. 

Some years later, the lineup was enlarged to a five-piece outfit with well-known ex-Polecat Boz Boorer (g) & John Buck (d) and the band released their more weirder, more diverse second album, Mad For It (1986), on ID Records, followed by another studio output Tuffer Than Tuff (1988) , a four track EP entitled You Can´t Judge A Book(1988) and a live album on the Link Records Live and Rockin´ (1989) series. 

Their unique blend of high-power Rockabilly, Blues and pure Rock`n´Roll energy still attracts both Psychobilly and Rockabilly followings all over the world and the band has also been included on many essential Psychobilly compilation albums, such as The Magnificent Seven and Hell's Bent On Rockin´ .

Some say they were moderately successful. Their most popular songs were '5705' and 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire'.

In the early 1970s Lol Mason, Steve Broughton, Max Thomas and Chris Dunn were playing folk music in the Birmingham area. They toured the clubs of the Midlands until, towards the end of 1975, they decided to turn professional. Meanwhile Broughton had begun to write songs. They were offered a recording contract by Phonogram Records on condition that they change their name (they were called ""Back In the Band"") and add drums and electric guitar. This prompted them to recruit Roger Kent and Mike Slamer.

Their first albums were City Boy (1975) and Dinner At The Ritz (1976). It was not until 1978, that they had their first hit with the song '5705'. The single reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.

Most of City Boy's albums were labelled and distributed by Vertigo Records, also known as PolyGram and Polydor.

Unable to secure a contract with any of the major companies, the band split up in 1982. Lol Mason formed The Maisonettes in 1982.

In the Philippines, the group was briefly popular for another song, ""Speechless"", the track from the band that played there. In 2000, Jorn Lande covered ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" with Ronni Le Tekro on guitar and Sid Ringsby on bass.

In August 2008, several City Boy albums, Book Early, Young Men Gone West, Dinner at the Ritz and the band's self-titled debut, were reissued. "

Sunset Sons are a band brought together by a love of music, surfing and snowboarding. They formed when Bournemouth-born singer Rory was singing cover songs on the piano at a bar in the French surfing resort of Soorts-Hossegor, where he worked washing dishes. His repertoire – everything from Coldplay to D12 to Queens Of The Stone Age – intrigued Newcastle native Jed. Along with two other friends the pair formed a touring covers band, roaming the Alps and playing to winter holidaymakers. The band then started writing songs themselves, and found themselves in a flurry of record label hype. Music industry bosses were coming to Val d'Isère to watch them play. “We were told they rarely leave London,” says Australian bassist Pete, “but there they were, up in the mountains with the snowboarding crowd, who can get pretty wild.” Two years later, sitting outside the very same beach bar and with a collection of their own original material, they signed their deal with Polydor Records. The plan now is to take the songs on the road, both in Britain and abroad. And, of course, to find time to squeeze in some surfing."

714834,532353,3882129,Europe,Wild Turkey,Stealer Of Years,1996,0.0,14,['Album'],['Rock'],['Blues Rock'],"After playing for Jethro Tull from 1967 to 1970 (he recorded three albums), bassist [a=Glenn Cornick] left the band and formed Wild Turkey with the following musicians: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass),  [a=Graham Hedley Williams] (Guitar), [a=Tweke Lewis] ( Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Drums) and [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (vocals). After a short period of time, the line-up was changed, Weathers and Williams left, replaced by [a2067822] (Guitar and Voice) and [a=Jeff Jones (2)] (Drums). This line-up features the album ""Battle Hymn"" on [l=Chrysalis Music], dated 1971 in Hard-Rock style with Progressive and Blues-Rock veins. The electric guitar and vocals are the protagonists, supported by a solid rhythm section and the record alternates more pushed tracks with other more melodic. The feedback is positive for both critics and audiences, thanks in part to their excellent live performances supporting bands such as Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, Procol Harum, Yes, Ten Years After and Zz Top. Despite the success of the first album and the live band changed again, Blackmore left the group replaced by [a=Mick Dyche] (Slide Guitar, Guitar and vocals) and [a=Steve Gurl] (Piano) added to the five. The sextet released a single called ""Good old days"", containing an unreleased B-side: ""Life Is a Symphony"", before the album ""Turkey"" also in 1972, in the hope of confirming and improving the success of the first work, but it was not so. The record is less incisive than the previous one, despite the excellent technical skills of the musicians and the addition of keyboards, they churn out a good record but that has a lesser impact than the pfirst. After a couple of years without any new record production and having had other changes in the line-up, [a=Bernie Marsden] (Guitar) replaces Dyche and [a=Kevin Currie] (Drums) takes Jones's place and in the mid of 1974 Wild Turkey disband, each member takes different musical path. Until 1996, when [a=Glenn Cornick], supported by the band's historical members, give Life at the Wild Turkey's second era, reforming the group and recording the third album 22 years after their dissolution. The reunion of ""Stealer of Years"" on [l=HTD Records] involves: [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica), [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass, Mandolin, Penny Whistle), [a=Tweke Lewis] (Electric guitar and acoustics, Backing Vocals), [a=Brian Thomas (25)] (Drums) and [a=Lee Morris (10)] (Keyboards) as guest. The sound differs from the 70s Turkey, oriented more towards blues-rock than the hard-rock of the first records. Well arranged and performed, more melodic tracks alternate with others more in the Rock vein for a pleasant return on the scene. The band seems to be ready to walk the stage again, instead the following studio album takes another 10 years, during which only two albums containing live recordings from the previous period are released: ""Final Performance"" in 2000 and ""Live in Edinburgh"" in 2001 by [l=Audio Archives] label. In 2002, a collection containing a repertoire of studio recordings from the 1970s was released by the same label. In 2006 they came out ""You & Me In The Jungle"" produced on [l=Wild Turkey Music Ltd] and the artists involved are: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass), [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Harmonic), [a=Mick Dyche] (Guitar, Bass, Voice), [a=Steve Gurl] (Keyboards), [a=Clive Bunker] (Drums), Graham Williams (Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Percussions, Vocals). Again the sound of the album differs from the first two, the tracks are different from one to another by genre, some more Blues, others more Rock, passing through Boogie moments or more Melodics, always maintaining an high-level technique in the performance. The latest album released by Wild Turkey is the ""Live at Wellington 1973"" also on [l=Audio Archives].

In 1991 they released Blood from Stone a much heavier hard rock album which is also classic for its genre although it didn't have a great success. After seven years of silence Dare changed their line up , Darren Wharton decided to start producing Dare's albums in his own studio from this point on. In 1998 Calm Before the Storm was released with a new sound of unique classic rock with balanced electric and acoustic gutitars and a multilayered production . In 2001 their next album Belief was released with a major change in the band's sound into more atmospheric classic rock along with celtic inlfluences . Dare established a really unique and trademark sound along with very emotional lyrics . In 2004 Dare released Beneath the Shining Wate"" with a darkier and more sentimental laid back sound than Belief which was followed by a live DVD release Power of Nature: Live in Munich.
One of the most famous former members of Dare is Brian Cox in an Episode of Carpool (available on iTunes and Youtube he told Robert Llewellyn he joined because he lived up the road from Darren and left because they had a fight on tour in Berlin.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

Their second album, Tracks, followed the next year, but despite critical acclaim, internal tensions in the band resulted in a breakup in 1973 before the group's third release, Old Soldiers Never Die. (Their unreleased 1970 album was released in 1996 as Home from Home.)

They crawled from the wreckage, blinking and confused – it was the 21st Century and the world need a lift. Fed up with shoe gazing, introspection and everyday rock stars, two men met in a shady bar in Leeds-POLLY PHLUID and TIM 'BERLAKE' JEFFS. Between them they hatched a plan to bring big, big riffs, ebola-catchy melodies and the glamour of confusion back to the live circuit. Looking for partners in crime for this deconstruction of music, they searched the world for like-minded souls. They found their bass player in the skeletal underworld of Gaudi’s Barcelona, he’s name was MIGUEL LUQUE and he was ready to take up the challenge. Next stop was New Zealand, where they found their drummer NISH GONSALKORALE hidden deep in the mysterious mountains, just waiting to unleashed.nReturning to Leeds, they found their rhythm rooting through bins for plectrums and old copies of Kerrang. Luring him in with pizza and the 'Appetite for Destruction' vinyl, they claimed KC DUGGAN as one of their own. The circle was complete, the riffs were large and the melodies to-die-for –ladies and gentlemen I give you...THE IDOL DEAD."

In 1970 Stan Webb had a falling-out with Mike Vernon which resulted in the group being dropped by their record label.

Born and raised in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Soares took part in a singing contest presented by the renowned Brazilian musician [a=Ary Barroso], and received the highest marks. In the late 1950s, Soares spent one year touring Argentina with Mercedes Batista. Soares became popular with her first single ""Se Acaso Você Chegasse"", on which she introduced the scat à la [a=Louis Armstrong] (although she said that she listened to American music at that time), adding a bit of jazz to samba. She moved to São Paulo, where she performed at theaters and night clubs. Her husky voice became her trademark. After finishing her second album, A Bossa Negra, Elza went to Chile to represent Brazil in the 1962 Football World Cup. Her outgoing and over-the-edge style fascinated audiences in Brazil and abroad.

In the 1970s, she toured the U.S. and Europe. She has been singing for more than 40 years. In 2000, she was awarded ""Best Singer of the Millennium"" by the BBC in London, where she performed in a concert with [a=Gal Costa], [a=Chico Buarque], [a=Gilberto Gil], [a=Caetano Veloso] and [a=Virgínia Rodrigues]. That same year, she played a series of avant-garde concerts directed by José Miguel Wisnik in Rio de Janeiro.

Soares scored a number of charts hits in Brazil throughout her career; some of the bigger hits include: ""Se Acaso Você Chegasse"" (1960), ""Boato"" (1961), ""Cadeira Vazia"" (1961), ""Só Danço Samba"" (1963), ""Mulata Assanhada"" (1965) and ""Aquarela Brasileira"" (1974).

A number of Soares's albums have also been re-released on CD in remastered editions: 1961's A Bossa Negra (containing her major hit of that year, ""Boato"") and 1972's big band backed Elza Pede Passagem (produced by [a=Dom Salvador]) being two of her most acclaimed releases. Elza Pede Passagem produced no major hit singles of the size of previous releases when originally released in Brazil; nevertheless, it is now considered a classic and representative of the ""samba-soul"" sound of the early 70s.

In 2002, her Do Cóccix Até O Pescoço album release earned her a Grammy nomination. The album received outstanding reviews in the music press and featured a who's who of Brazilian artists collaborating with her; Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, [a=Carlinhos Brown] and [a=Jorge Ben Jor] to name just a few. The release kickstarted a number of successful tour dates around the world. Two singles from the album were also promoted to Brazilian radio, ""A Cigarra"" and ""Bambino"", both were backed by promotional videos.

In 2004, Soares released her Vivo Feliz album to great acclaim. It contained the single, ""Rio de Janeiro"", a homage to her city of birth. While not as successful in sales as her previous release, the album carried on the theme of mixing samba and bossa with modern electronic music and effects. The album featured collaborations with groundbreaking artists such as [a=Nando Reis], [a=Fred Zero Quatro] (leader of manguebeat band [a=Mundo Livre S/A]) and [a=Zé Keti].

More recently, Soares teamed up with Jair Rodrigues and a number of contemporary samba artists such as Seu Jorge for the old school flavoured Sambistas multi artist album which was released in 2009. In 2016, A Mulher do Fim do Mundo was released internationally with the translated title Woman At The End Of The World.[2] She also had the honour of performing at the opening ceremomy of the 2016 Rio Olympics."

However, that strategy also yields melody, as the old-fashioned voodoobilly of Busted Lip and the vintage psychedelic-pop of Handle Bars prove. If Blood Feast winks a bit too obviously at mainstream U2-esque arena-rock, and the hypnotic lullaby Seedgazer is too mellow to truly engage, a case of unrestrained madness fuels the pounding gargatuan (but way too brief) White Flag Riot and the gloomy garage rant of New World. Eccentric nuances pop up everywhere in the brutal and raw arrangements, bestowing a sense of maximum instability onto the songs."

Spearheading Blitz's ultra-chic clientele were Steve Strange and DJ Rusty Egan, one time drummer with the Rich Kids. Seeking to record music of their own to fit in with the club's regular playlist (a steady diet of David Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Roxy Music), Strange and Egan were offered studio time by another Rich Kids alum, guitarist Midge Ure. In late 1978, this trio recorded a demo which yielded the first Visage single, an aptly futuristic cover of Zager & Evans' ""In the Year 2525.""

Adding Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie as well as three members of Magazine -- bassist Barry Adamson, guitarist John McGeoch, and keyboardist Dave Formula -- Visage signed to Martin Rushent's Genetic Records to release ""Tar,"" in September of 1979, followed a year later by their self-titled debut LP. The album yielded a major single in ""Fade To Grey,"" an instant club classic which heralded synth-pop's imminent commercial breakthrough. The follow-up, ""Mind of a Toy,"" was a Top 20 hit. Next came their sophomore album, 1982's ""The Anvil."" Midge, John, Dave and Billy left in 1983.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

His distinctive fretless bass sound and melodic playing style were a trademark of the band's sound. 

He emigrated to the UK from Cyprus in the early 1960s and met the three other founding members of Japan at Catford Boys' School in London.  Japan split in 1982, bowing out after a successful world tour and accompanying album, ""Oil On Canvas.""

Inside and outside Japan, Mick developed a distinctive and original bass sound instantly recognizable as his own. Mick was mainly a self-taught musician and many feel he forever changed the perception of how the bass is played and heard.  His rubbery, unique playing led best friend and Polytown band mate David Torn to say of Mick, ""It's as if Bootsy Collins was from Morocco.""  He also played woodwind instruments, mainly clarinet and saxophone, among many others.

Mick was a celebrated sculptor as well as an author and chef; he later qualified in psychiatry. He spoke several languages and in 2009 published his autobiography, ""Japan and Self Existence.""

After Japan, Mick worked in many areas of music, experimenting in jazz, ambient and prog, and continued to create his own indefinable music as a solo artist and in collaboration with other great musicians, including ex-members of Japan.

His first solo album, ""Titles,"" and the first Dalis Car collaboration, ""The Waking Hour,"" give those new to his music a good place to discover it."

10343,14318,232169,US,Tangerine Dream,Green Desert,1986,38.48,4,"['LP', 'Album']","['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Ambient', 'Berlin-School', 'Krautrock']","Founded by the late [a=Edgar Froese], Tangerine Dream is perhaps the premier exponent of ""electronic rock"" music of the ""Berlin School"". From their ""free-rock"" beginnings in the nascent ""krautrock"" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional ""rock"" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.

Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the ""krautrock"" twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and ""freak out jamming"" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the ""Berlin School"". Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.

The original line-up included Paul Gilmartin (drums), Paul Nash (guitar), Steve Rawlings (voice), Lyndon Scarfe (keyboards), and Tim Wright (bass).  After their 1983 album [i]Heaven Is Waiting[/i], Scarfe left and was replaced by David Whitaker (formerly with [a210939]).  The band released two more singles on Arista - ""Say It Again"" (produced by [a20942]) and ""Hold On"" (produced by [a41642]) - and plans were announced for an album of older tracks ('Heaven Again') re-recorded in a more danceable, radio-friendly fashion, which never came to fruition.  Instead, the band left Arista and demoed new songs, which were released in 1986 as their final album, [i]Looking Through[/i], once again on their own label.  
Steve Rawlings started [a40935], while the other band members continued for some time as Johnny in the Clouds, which never released any recordings.

At the end of 2009, Paul Gilmartin, Paul Nash, and David Whitaker met up for the first time in 24 years and decided to reform the band; initially, Steve Rawlings also agreed to rejoin the band.  Over the next nine months, instrumental tracks were recorded, and in October 2010, Rawlings briefly met with the band in the UK, but returned to America after recording just one vocal track.  Plans changed when, after that initial meeting, the band lost contact with Rawlings.  In January 2011, vocalist Maethelyiah (of [a520865])  recorded vocals for all thirteen tracks, and the official news of her joining the band was revealed the following May with the release of the reformation album [i]Change of Skin[/i].  
Bassist Martin Roberts joined the band before the release of [i]Scarey Tales[/i] in February 2013.  A year later, the band issued a statement that Gilmartin and Roberts had unexpectedly resigned from the band, resulting in the cancellation of a series of tour dates and Paul Nash being the sole founding member keeping the rights to the band name. David Whittaker had already left after the release.
The remaining band carried on without them, recruiting Iain Hunter (drums) and Jack Cooper (bass).  Their sixth studio album, [i]VI[/i], was released in September 2015.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid.

Songs are reorchestrated and recomposed, the contours of these songs are re-colored, in the same way a colorist would do in a movie or comic book. Although the arrangements of the songs are completely new, you can call it ‘an acoustic live remix’ or ‘an inverse Karaoke’. 

The orchestra is characterized by its members, an eight-piece outfit, among them; Kobe Proesmans (percussion, calabash), Aarich Jespers (percussion, flapamba), [a=Sep François] (melodic percussion, hammered mbar), [a=Wim De Busser] (grand piano, prepared piano, keys), [a=Tim Vandenbergh] (doublebass, el.bass), [a=Gerrit Valckenaers] (bass clarinet, stones, mirrors, glass bowls, electronics), [a=Jeroen Baert] (violin), [a=Karel Coninx] (viola)

The Colorist invites singers they admire into their world and whose music they feel a strong connection with; previously, they had the honour to work with [a=Sumie Nagano] (Japan/Sweden - Bella Union) 2014, [a=Cibelle] (UK/Brazil - Crammed Disc) 2014 and [a=Emiliana Torrini] (Iceland - Rough Trade) 2015. The Colorist’s last collaboration with Miss Torrini received raving reviews in the Belgian press and concerts sold out in almost all venues. This collaboration is extended into a series of upcoming international concerts and the release of a live recording.

His distinctive fretless bass sound and melodic playing style were a trademark of the band's sound. 

He emigrated to the UK from Cyprus in the early 1960s and met the three other founding members of Japan at Catford Boys' School in London.  Japan split in 1982, bowing out after a successful world tour and accompanying album, ""Oil On Canvas.""

Inside and outside Japan, Mick developed a distinctive and original bass sound instantly recognizable as his own. Mick was mainly a self-taught musician and many feel he forever changed the perception of how the bass is played and heard.  His rubbery, unique playing led best friend and Polytown band mate David Torn to say of Mick, ""It's as if Bootsy Collins was from Morocco.""  He also played woodwind instruments, mainly clarinet and saxophone, among many others.

Mick was a celebrated sculptor as well as an author and chef; he later qualified in psychiatry. He spoke several languages and in 2009 published his autobiography, ""Japan and Self Existence.""

After Japan, Mick worked in many areas of music, experimenting in jazz, ambient and prog, and continued to create his own indefinable music as a solo artist and in collaboration with other great musicians, including ex-members of Japan.

His first solo album, ""Titles,"" and the first Dalis Car collaboration, ""The Waking Hour,"" give those new to his music a good place to discover it."

While her songs are shaped by both pain and joy; there is a hopefulness and inspiration pervading these tracks which will move and motivate every listener to follow their dreams and take hold of their future happiness.

Fresh from supporting Shane Filan on his successful 10 date UK Tour and having played such iconic venues as Ronnie Scott’s bar, London, in 2017 Nikki will be embarking on a 32 date UK tour supporting Sam Bailey.

Hailing from Oxford (although it’s hard to pin her down now that she lives on the road in a freshly converted van) Nikki Loy is a true adventurer.

Known for her sensational vocals Nikki’s voice can move you to your very core, carrying such maturity in her tone that coupled with depth and emotion of her lyrics her performances regularly inspire fans to follow her example and pursue their own dreams. Nikki brings a wealth of musical experience that includes busking, festivals, Hillsong music college in Australia, writing a column for The Oxford Times and writing 52 songs in 52 weeks.

She has supported a host of stars such as jazz great Janette Mason, Americana artist Lauren Pritchard, Decca Artist Krystina Myles, and Irish pop folk singer Wallis Bird and many more.

With a growing back catalogue of two albums, two EPs and a live album ...and an also impressive resume of gigs including Ronnie Scott’s Bar, London, the New
Theatre in Oxford and the Cobden Club, London, Nikki is an established musician well known and well loved across the UK. Her influences in the early years were blues and soul but her growing interest in music introduced her to Country and Americana, and as a sponge for fresh inspiration she is passionate about electronica and pop too. As a result the music that pours out of Nikki is a unique blend of all that poured in.

She has also co-written for a well know Saatchi & Saatchi ad campaign - and the award winning video for her single ‘Can I Keep You’ was chosen by the BBC to be part of their Music Video Festival, screened on big screens in town centres across the UK, also reaching the final of the UK Songwriting Contest. 

Of herself Nikki says... 

I sing, I write songs, for a very long time I have been a painter and an illustrator. Some moments I am a blogger and a designer. I’m always a daughter, a sister, a lover, a friend. One label is not enough.

I like freshly brewed coffee, peanut butter on toast, peppermint tea and mango sorbet. I prefer a mostly plant based diet and feel all wrong if I don’t eat an avocado everyday. I love sunshine, but I really love fat green leaves and they need lots of rain, so I appreciate the rain. I love the smell of a forest after a downpour. I like staying home with my man, and tearing up the stage with my musician friends. I like keeping myself to myself and I like meeting new people. I love dressing up. I love to be inspired and feel creative but also to feel grounded and alive. Sometimes I like to collaborate but mostly I like working alone. I write songs, take photos and paint pictures to record life and bless others.

I sing because I can’t help myself, it’s the overflow of my life.

I am also a big supporter of other dreamers, of local independent businesses and people who grow stuff and love the planet. We all just want the world to be a better place! :0) I value personal growth and being a life long learner. I believe we are all one in this great universe and that consciousness is the key to creating a wonderful future for humanity. I believe there is abundance for all, if we could only work together.

Like Ron Dicianni, I trust that God (Universal Consciousness) will take my works and like stars, fling them out into the universe to those who might need them.

Love,


Nikki Loy Signature"

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

The same year, the band cut their self-titled debut album, which was produced by [a=Ian Paice] and [a=Roger Glover] and saw Dio credited under his real name, Ronald Padavona.

Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

Mitchell and Greig were then almost immediately replaced by former [a1057516] drummer Frank Beard and Billy Etheridge respectively, finalising their classic line-up when Dusty Hill, another former member of American Blues, replaced Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units.

Despite the Tanzanian government short-lived ban on soul (both music and dancing) inspired by their Ujamaa policy in 1969, Sunburst grew as a band and developed their own musical direction which they later called Kitoto Sound, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of the band members. Lyrical themes included black pride and colonial oppression – the band even played a gig for visiting civil rights heroine Angela Davis.

After June 1973, Sunburst gained a national audience through a live session for the state-owned Radio Tanzania, a crucial means for domestic bands to air their work. A month later, they won a band competition in Dar Es Salaam and their popularity in Tanzania grew further. They began recording singles in Kenya, standing apart from the predominantly rumba, jazz or taarab styles sung in local languages at the time. Sunburst were not the only local band to draw on soul and jazz but most others did not release their music commercially.

In 1974, Sunburst met Zambian musician Rikki Ililonga from Zamrock group Musi-O-Tunya and he invited them to Zambia. Meeting their later manager, car company employee Peter Bagshawe, they embarked on an ill-fated tour with Kenyan funk band Matata before working on a first full album in 1976 in Lusaka with new band members. The LP came out at the height of the Zamrock scene led by bands like Witch and Ngozi Family but Sunburst offered a more intricate sound as musicians born in six different countries tapped into a multitude of styles, languages and stories. “Our songs support freedom struggles and encourage peasants and workers to work harder,” singer James Mpungo recounted. “Our songs also criticize our people for allowing themselves to be too westernized.” After a handful of further singles for Tanzanian state label TFC, including the popular ‘Banchikicha’, the band split, frustrated by living on “bare minimum earnings” from their music."

Later band members included Neil Finn's brother [a247008], [a437425] and Americans [a418822] and [a847062]. 

Mark Hart who had toured with the group joined as a permanent member in 1993. Founding drummer Hester left in the band in May 1994 citing family reasons. He briefly returned for their ""Farewell to the World"" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996 and also played on three new tracks recorded for the album ""Recurring Dream"" (1996). His replacement was Peter Jones who remained with the group until they disbanded in 1996.

On 26 March 2005, Hester died by suicide. In 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums in 2007 and 2010.

In November 2016 they were inducted into the ARIA (Australian Recording Industry Association) Hall of Fame.

On 9 December 2019, Neil Finn unveiled via his official web site that the band's new line-up - alongside himself and Seymour - would add [a55974], [a592970] and [a842515]. As a result, Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod would no longer participate.

Although other New Zealand solo acts have topped the US charts, the group hold the distinction of being the only New Zealand band to have made it to #2 in the US Billboard Singles chart, with their single ""Don't Dream It's Over""."

Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Ellefsen started his musical career as bass player in Norwegian black metal band Emperor, but having been kicked out from the band led him to pursue a solo career as Mortiis. The music was initially synthesizer-based ambient soundtracks and he is often considered as the progenitor of the so called dungeon synth style. During the mid-1990's Mortiis also had various side projects (Vond, Fata Morgana and Cintecele Diavolui) that he released through his own self-produced Dark Dungeon Music. With the release of ""The Smell of Rain"" in 2001 he abandoned the ambient/dungeon synth style and moved into more song oriented territory and started to mix electro and synth pop with heavy guitars and also performed lead vocals. At this point Mortiis was also formed as a band for the first time, yet Ellefsen is the only constant member of the group. With ""The Grudge"" Mortiis took the music further into industrial rock direction. In 2020 Mortiis started to perform again the early dungeon synth material.

Ultra-Violence are an Italian thrash metal band from Turin, Italy. Formed in 2009, their members currently consist of Loris Castiglia (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Andrea Vacchiotti (lead guitar), Andrea Lorenti (Bass), and Francesco ""Frullo"" La Rosa (drums).

The band signed with the Italian label Punishment 18 Records in 2012. They released their debut EP ""Wildcrash"" in the same year and their first album ""Privilege To Overcome"" one year later. The album received positive approval from all over the world and was included in a large amount of magazines and websites as one of the best thrash metal albums of 2013. That led them to play a good amount of live shows in Europe catching the ear of English extreme metal label Candlelight Records and soon after the band agreed to join them.

Their second album ""Deflect The Flow"" was released in 2015 taking the band to a new level and expanding their fanbase. One month later they played at Metalitalia.com Festival in Italy on the same stage as bands like Testament, Exodus, Fleshgod Apocalypse and Onslaught.

In 2016 they faced their first lineup changes as their former bass player Roberto ""Robba"" Dimasi and former drummer Simone Verre left the band. It took months to put the new lineup togheter but this allowed the band to come back stronger and more determined than ever before.

Right after that Ultra-Violence were back on the road playing shows and festivals all around Europe supporting bands like Discharge, Angelus Apatrida, Tokyo Blade and Rotting Christ. They also reached Japan for a couple of shows with Skull Fist.

The band's new album ""Operation Misdirection"" will come out on July 2018 via Candlelight/Spinefarm records.

For Nordic Giants the performance is the thing, and as those who have seen the live show will attest, it is a visceral experience that goes beyond the normal descriptors. Each mind-blowing performance involves a chosen few short films, which are soundtracked live with atmospheric soundscapes.

“Air whistles and whines around my ears, Distant echoes drift through endless minds, And magnetised to empty thoughts” 
Largely instrumental, A Séance Of Dark Delusions reflects the inspired musical experimentation and atmosphere of SigurRós, 65daysofstatic, Bjork and Pink Floyd. Nordic Giants bring a heavy orchestral brutality through progressive guitar, drum and brass, which are paired with beautiful and haunting electronics as they warp loops and end of the world samples through pattered keys.
“The hollow sound resonates from morbid tone, And aloft the music goes, Notes bend and warp as the swell rolls” 
When they pull lyricism from the human world, Nordic Giants enlist the vocal features of artists, Saturday Sun (‘Dissolve’), Nadine Wild Palmer (‘Futures Dark’), Freyja (‘Give Flight To The Imagination’), and Beth Cannon (‘Rapture’). 
“Unborn thoughts sleep silently in the mind, A heavy cushion of warm unblemished noise, The heart beats slowly in time with the dull thud of drum”

Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer].

Grand Tour was born from a long held fascination with the cold war years and the nuclear stand-off between the super powers – the film “On the Beach” was a huge influence to the music as well, and many of the musical ideas flowed from the visual imagery of the movie.

Hew was joined first by local guitarist Andrew Young, whose background was in electronic and rock music and who had played with a number of bands – Andrew was keen to make the move into the prog rock genre, and he and Hew worked away at the material as song ideas were gradually developed.

Hew and Andrew were joined in 2007 by Joe Cairney, former vocalist with the then dormant Comedy of Errors. Joe had had a long and illustrious singing career with the Errors and was keen to get back to singing after a gap of many years. Initially he had got in touch with Abel Ganz, who were struggling to find a new vocalist at that time; when that didn’t work out he was quickly snapped up by Hew to work on the Grand Tour vocals.

With Hew, Andrew and Joe working away at the music, the whole project was given a huge boost by the addition of drummer Bruce Levick in 2009. Bruce and Andrew had been corresponding for some time on the internet but had never actually met until they teamed up in Grand Tour! Bruce’s drive gave the project a whole new impetus, and all the tracks were gradually reviewed with the addition of his drumming.

In 2010 Andrew was replaced by Joe’s old friend and former Comedy of Errors guitarist Mark Spalding, who agreed to join up after a brief listen to the existing demos. Mark’s powerful and varied style of playing is now one of the major features of Grand Tour.

This line-up has recorded the first Grand Tour album, “Heavy on the Beach”, released on the 2nd of February 2015."

The band was formed in 1993 as ""[a3007400]"" by Alexi Laiho and Jaska Raatikainen. Different sources tend to categorize them stylistically in different ways, but according to the lead singer and guitarist Alexi Laiho, ""it's just metal and that's it"".

In 1997, Inearthed made a record deal with a small Belgian label to release their first album ""Something Wild"", but before the release the band was contacted by [l=Spinefarm Records], who also wanted to work with the band. Since they were already signed to another label, they had to fake a split-up and change the name to be able to release the album through Spinefarm. They chose ""Children of Bodom"" as the new name, inspired by the unsolved Lake Bodom murders, which took place in Finland in 1960 (teenagers camping next to the Lake Bodom were slaughtered by a maniac).

In November 2019 Raatikainen, Seppälä and Wirman announced that they were leaving the band, which also marked the end of Children of Bodom. Their final performance was in the Helsinki ice hall on December 15, 2019. Since he wouldn't be able to legally continue performing under the ""Children of Bodom"" banner, Alexi Laiho formed ""Bodom After Midnight"" in March 2020.

One year later, a split with their friends Lodo was out. Released in 2,014 by Marchalenta Records and Discos Macarras, contains two original songs of ten minutes long, more doom metal oriented (influenced by funeral doom) and a cover of Pentagram. The cd digipack was released by Thid I Rex.

In October 2017, their second LP came. “Death May Die”, with a new singer on board was again on top of doom releases and the vinyl version released by Lay Bare Recordings was sold out in the band's bandcamp really quick. The reviews were unanimous, with the highest rates the band ever reached. At the same time, they released a cover of “For my fallen angel” by their beloved My Dying Bride. This cover was included in a compilation by doom-metal.com.

In early 2,018, the line up changes come again and Julian Velasco (guitar), Tano Giménez (bass) and Miguel Fernández (drums) decided to continue as a trio. They wrote a new album in less than two months and asked Ayla Mae-Coghlan to sing as a session member. In search for constant evolution, the band experimented again (as they did in every album), with new sounds and production and the result is “Vegvísir”, 5 new songs where the band find their own way to make things happen, a collection of beautiful melodies, dark and eerie ambients and melancholic feelings.
The album, released in late November 2019 by Tormo Records was recorded at Red Records, mixed in Siete Barbas Estudio in Barcelona and mastered by René Rutten himself from The Gathering/Habitants.

The constant evolution was a trademark of the band, in search for the most pure form of honesty in their music, running away from trends, and “Vegvísir” was the final result of letting their feelings come out."

It was started by Toru with High School friends Alex and Ryota after each of them got their musical instruments. After that, Taka joined as their vocalist and they focused on performing shows in the Tokyo area.

In 2006 they independently released 2 mini albums. Because of their albums sales, their participation in relatively large festivals that summer and their energetic shows in the outskirts of Tokyo, they were noticed by a foreign record company.

In March 2007 Tomoya officially joined the group and the band finally made their major debut by releasing their first single 内秘心書(Naihi Shinsho) on April 25th.

The band’s name, One Ok Rock, came from “one o’clock,” the time that the band used to practice on weekends. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between r’s and l’s, they changed “o’clock” to “o’crock” (or “o’krock”) which then was separated to become “ok rock”.

On April 5th, 2009, Alex was arrested for allegedly groping a female prep school student. They were going to release the single 「Ａｒｏｕｎｄ　ザ　ｗｏｒｌｄ　少年」on May 6th but this was cancelled. The song was also going to be used for the drama ‘God Hand Teru’ but was replaced. Also, a nationwide tour was cancelled because of the incident. On May 15th, it was announced the Alex has left the group and the other 4 members would continue activites in the summer without him.

ONE OK ROCK continued as a four-member group and made a comeback with a live concert tour that started on September 5, 2009, titled Overcome Emotion. Their first release afterwards was their fourth single, “Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer”, on February 3, 2010. The band followed up with their fourth album, Niche Syndrome, which was released on June 9. Their next single, “Answer is Near”, was released on February 16, 2011.

The band released their first double A-side single “Re:make/No Scared” on July 20, 2011, the latter song being the main theme for the Black Rock Shooter: The Game video game. The band’s fifth album, Zankyo Reference, was released on October 5, 2011. Their latest single, “The Beginning”, which is used as a theme for the live action movie adaptation of the Rurouni Kenshin manga, was released on August 22, 2012."

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond. However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG. Phil Mogg and Andy Parker were still members of UFO by 2019, when the band began what they called a farewell tour.

1991. Acid Death at their first steps in recording, perform an independent production of their first mini LP called “Balance Of Power”, a piece of work that was to remain on the shelf and see the light many years later when the band had dissolved in the form of free downloading.

1993. The year they release their first official work, the EP “Apathy Murders Hope” by the Greek independent label MOLON LAVE recs, providing the first evidence of the Progressive Death Metal path that the band was to follow a few years later.

1995. Two years later, a split-LP is recorded and released with Spanish Extreme Metallers AVULSED. The band has already lost the opportunity of a very good record deal with a famous label of that time due to military services.

1998. The first full length album “Pieces Of Mankind” is recorded and released, showing the Progressive character that is to be followed by the band. ACID DEATH were walking a tightrope between Death Metal and Fusion/Jazz and the first negative arrows began to come… The album remains forgotten and scorned to domestic record store shelves, but the re-release of 1999 by the English fledgling label Copro Recs/Casket Music makes it “Album of the Month” in a VERY well-known English magazine, which is radical and unheard-of for a Greek Metal band, that season…

2000. The swansong “Random’s Manifest” full length album is released by the already established BLACK LOTUS recs making the name of ACID DEATH affirmed and applauded by the European press and made fun-of in their own country! The provocative cover of the album is censored and the CD is removed from the German market… For the first time the foundation of the band start grinding unusually strange…

2001. After 12 years and 4 official releases, the band announced its disband while being in the studio for the pre-production of their third full-length.

2008. “Pieces Of Mankind” is to be the first among the “Greek Metal Scene-40 Most Distinctive Album of all Time” as voted by the editors of the Greek RockHard Magazine.

2009. 18 years after its recording, the first -unreleased- mini LP of ACID DEATH sees the light in the form of a free downloading as a “gift” to those who had appreciated the band all the past years.

2011. “Life After Death”… A case not rare, but with an another application. The name of the band is strengthened and boasted while practically ACID DEATH “…are non-existent for over 10 years”. The band announces its return, officially on January 11th.

2012. On June 1st, reunited ACID DEATH release their 3rd album and 5th official release, titled «Eidolon» , by Austrian NOISEHEAD Records. The album gains great reviews and comments from everywhere, giving the band the second chance it deserved. ACID DEATH arrange and finance their first tour after the reunion, on Greek soil.

2013. The material from band’s split LP from 1995 is re-recorded and re-released as independent free digital EP titled “MisleD 2013”. In the same year, on METAL DAYS Festival-Band Competition, ACID DEATH gain position #7 among more than 600 bands from all over the world and their appearance at METAL DAYS fest 2013 is realized.

2014. The first European tour after band’s return is a fact. The Witch Hunt European Tour together with US Death Metal legends MASTER.

2015. ACID DEATH sign a 5-year contract with German 7hard/7us Media Group GmbH and band’s 6th official release, the album «Hall Of Mirrors» sees the light on September 11th, gaining excellent reviews and comments from press and fans. For many, this is the most integrated and powerful work ACID DEATH have ever done.

2016. English Copro Recs/Casket Music re-releases band’s first 2 albums, “Pieces Of Mankind” and “Random’s Manifest” that were completely sold out the previous years. The albums are re-mastered, including bonus material from the time they were originally recorded and released. At the same time, “Hall Of Mirrors”, becomes #5 in the article “Greeks Do It Better - 70+ most inspired albums by Greek bands for the years 2015-16” by the Greek Metal Hammer magazine. (issue #337/May 2016)

2017. After 25 complete years ACID DEATH’s “Balance Of Power” album, actually band’s very first, physically unreleased and “lost” recording, is scheduled to be released for first time on its official form, on March 10th, by the independent label Floga records. The same season, ACID DEATH’s first ever digital single “Life And Death – feat. Jon Soti” from Hall Of Mirrors album, released by 7hard/7us, is reaching position #11 at German Amazon (charts/new releases). It is the first time that ACID DEATH enter charts with a release…

After some months and one e.p. they changed their name to Pop Will Eat Itself (PWEI) and earned attention from the indie scene for their first e.p., The Poppies Say Grrr! on Chapter 22. At the time they played short, fast, slightly psychedelic punk-pop tunes and went on with that for three more e.p.'s before starting to incorporate house and hip hop beats and samples on Beaver Patrol. By autumn 1987 PWEI released their first album, Box Frenzy, with some tunes leaning towards new wave, some towards hip hop and acid house. A drum machine called Dr. Nightmare was installed and Graham Crabb took the second microphone.

After the 12"" Def.Con.One PWEI signed a deal with RCA and released Can U Dig It? in 1989, which would be the first of 12 PWEI singles going UK top 40. In the same year their seminal second album This Is The Day...This Is The Hour...This Is This! appeared to public and critical acclaim for its witty fusion of rock and electronic music.
PWEI opted for an even more electronic, slightly darker and moodier approach on Cure For Sanity, their third album, which appeared in 1990 alongside PWEI's alternative soccer world cup theme, Touched By The Hand Of Cicciolina, a fusion of dub and acid house.

Electronics took a backseat on 1992's The Looks Or The Lifestyle, when Fuzz Townshend was brought in as a drummer. PWEI reinvented themselves as grungey groovers and released Get The Girl! Kill The Baddies! as their highlight single. PWEI had been sacked by RCA at the time the single went number 9 in the UK in early 1993.

The band signed with Infectious in the UK and Nothing in the US and released R.S.V.P., Ich Bin Ein Auslander, and Everything's Cool as singles in 1993 and 1994. The tunes displayed a development from where they had left towards dark industrial rock. The mixture on their fifth album Dos Dedos Mis Amigos was received well and won the band many new fans.

Nonetheless, the band only released the remix album Two Fingers My Friends after that and collapsed upon the departure of Graham Crabb in 1996. Crabb released an album as Golden Claw Musics, Richard March went on to form Bentley Rhythm Ace, Fuzz Townshend went solo, and Clint Mansell has done film soundtracks. In 2005, a reunion tour and new songs were announced, but the reformation fizzled out by the end of the year.

In 2010, in the wake of the dissolution of Vile Evils, Graham Crabb announced his intention to reconstitute PWEI.  By 2011, Crabb had recruited new band members, and PWEI released a new album, New Noise Designed By A Sadist, and went on tour.

Initially making his mark in 90’s group Derrero, Ash has continued to quietly release albums under the Pulco banner for the best part of fifteen years in amongst the chaos and busyness of his regular life.

During his time in Derrero the band released 3 critically acclaimed albums and toured with the likes of Super Furry Animals, Catatonia, Sebadoh and Granddaddy as well as collaborating on the film ‘Beautiful Mistake’ with John Cale. The band also recorded three sessions for the legendary John Peel .

Unpredictable and innovative, Pulco music is made with intentionally minimal means, just one microphone and an iPad. His autobiographical sketchbook style has characteristically diverse influences from Lou Barlow & Pavement to R. Stevie Moore and outsider art .

A prolific bedroom recording enthusiast, Pulco creates a musical patchwork of poetic fragments, found sounds,  household instrumentation and delightfully off kilter melodies that deserves to be in a genre of its own

Pulco is experimenting for your enjoyment, not your discomfort ‘

His teen years were spent in a wide variety of ensembles and stylistic settings – classical, jazz, pop and rock – often 4 or 5 days a week throughout his schooling. Mainly performing on french horn at this time but also on piano and self taught electric guitar and bass. He also developed an enthusiasm for computer music, composing & arranging extensively using sequencing software and home recording equipment.

Al earned his degree in music from Colchester institute in 1993 and a teaching certificate the following year from Bretton Hall. Whilst studying for his degree he held the piano chair in the university big band as well as continuing to play orchestral french horn.

After completing formal studies Al became a part time instrumental teacher for Devon Youth Music. At the same time he started to build a reputation as an electric bass player, musical director & arranger amongst the local soul & big bands, spent several years with world music improv band Rifiki and a short spell with heavy rock band Aesculus Hipp. With the collapse of the teaching arm of the music service in 2004 Al took the opportunity to become a full time self-employed musician and to expand his skills into playing double bass as well.

Since then Al has run a jazz jam session at the Globe in Exeter for 3 years, an improvisation / composition workshop called The Other Compass, the E.S.P. jam session in Bristol and the successful Blue Vanguard Jazz Club with Coach York & Craig Milverton since 2011.  His own bands (Monkey’s Uncle, Time Wasters, Power of Time Monkeys, Mother Popcorn, the Art Trip and most recently ​The Al Swainger Q'tet) have always met with critical approval and delighted audiences.

Al's reputation as a sideman is formidable and is well known as someone able to slip easily into any context and sound like he's been doing it all his life at a moment's notice. He has been awarded 5th place in the British Jazz Awards three times from 2012-14. See below for a full rundown of collaborations through the years.

He continues to break new ground as a freelance artist and has released albums with the Art Trip (Music of Art Pepper), art rockers Grice (Alexandrine), omni-fusion trio Snow Giants (UN), his own solo project Pointless Beauty (A Lonely Vigil / After & Before / Shall Brothers Be) and Biophosmos : The Music of Chick Corea.​"

Quach composes visual guitar-based soundscapes and experimental music that goes beyond the typical song structure. By exploring his guitar as a tone generator, he furthers the boundaries of his instrument with the use of multiple effect processors & real-time loop-samplers, alternating the guitar signal’s shape and tone, blending textures over textures, merging a wide combination of sounds together and developing the melodies hidden in these walls of sound. Concrete musical ideas are often generated by the re-interpretation, the decomposition and the reconstruction of its own improvisations.

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

'Southern Rock' band out of Florida in the mid 1980's. Members included Ron Perry (lead vocals), Richard Smith (bass guitar), and Bobby Ingram (lead guitar) of Molly Hatchet.
As to the history of Jacksonville's China Sky, it's an ugly story, but not an uncommon one in the music industry. Band works hard and plays hard. Demos are created and pitched to unsuspecting labels. Interest is fleeting and rejection ensues. Then in a glimmer of hope, a major label takes interest, and China Sky records their debut. Airplay follows and interest begins to swell. Then the shit hits the fan. Label and management drop the ball with little to no support, including tour appearances. The band sinks and dissolves, another victim to the prostitution that is the music biz. But don't feel sorry for China Sky, they may finally be getting their revenge.
By the interest of many fans of the band and classic rock in general, that first album was a cult classic. And songs began to resurface on the Internet. Original members, vocalist Ron Perry and bassist Richard Smith, are a bit mystified by the interest, but take to writing once again. Behold, another label takes interest in UK's Escape Music, and China Sky's II emerges."

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768].

This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

Follow up 'Strange News From The Sun’ was released in 2015 on the UK based label Wonderfulsound. 'Arrangements swell and swirl with orchestral flourish as Nev channels Lee Hazlewood and Ennio Morricone to create his own unique sound.'

Inspired by the rain-drenched streets of Manchester and the sun-beaten canyons of America lies Nev third album ‘Broken Flowers’ released in 2017. A deeply cinematic, string-soaked album rich in atmosphere and brooding ambience that dwells somewhere in the mythical deserts of a Sergio Leone or Wim Wenders movie.

2019 sees the release of Nev’s fourth album ‘River’s Edge’. 'After all these years it feels like I finally know what I'm doing. For some reason I had this image of the River's Edge in my head - a promised land where I wanted to be.'

With nods to the late, great Scott Walker, Neil Young and Tom Waits, River's Edge looks to the mythical LA music scene but viewed through a very English lens. 'There is a pastoral quality to the songs on this album - they're all about the hidden places I love discovering in the English countryside. The songs are my way of working out what's going on in the world. Finding some sense in all the crazy madness. I hope people can come and join me in this special place and find some repose."

Died: 04 October 1970, Los Angeles, California, USA.

[b]Joplin[/b] was the eldest of her siblings [a3565868] and [a3565870], and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where she began painting and listening to blues artists [a=Bessie Smith], [a=Leadbelly], [a=Big Mama Thornton] and [a=Odetta] with the other rebellious kids in her neighborhood. She graduated high school in 1960, and in 1962, she quit university in the middle of her studies. The university then ran the headline, ""She Dares To Be Different"" in the student newspaper.

She went to San Francisco in 1963, first living in North Beach and later, Haight-Ashbury, where she begun the drug and alcohol habits that would tragically end her life. During this period, she recorded a session with [a=Jorma Kaukonen] that later appeared as the bootleg ""The Typewriter Tape"". Noticeably suffering from her addictions, she returned to Port Arthur in May 1965 and 'straightened up' for a year, enrolling as a sociology major at Lamar University.

In 1966, at the invitation of [a=Chet Helms] whom she'd known as a teenager, she returned to California and was recruited as the singer for [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] in June, appearing at the [l=Avalon Ballroom] in San Francisco during her first public performance with them. In August 1966, the group signed with [l=Mainstream Records] and recorded an album. However, it was not released until a year later and in the meantime, with very little reward, they moved with the [a=Grateful Dead] to a house in Lagunitas, California. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drug use.

Joplin and the band signed with [a=Albert Grossman] in November 1967 and released [r559560] in 1968. This release was the culmination of a year in which Joplin had wowed audiences at the Monterey Pop Festival, the Anderson Theater in New York, the Wake For Martin Luther King Jr concert with [a=Jimi Hendrix] in New York and on TV's prime-time Dick Cavett Show. Joplin then left the band after a Family Dog benefit gig in December 1968 and formed a back-up group, the [a=Kozmic Blues Band], releasing an album in September 1969. The group disbanded three months later, with Joplin again suffering from her addictions.

After taking time out in Brazil with close friend Linda Gravenites (wife of Bay Area musician [a=Nick Gravenites] from 1962-1970), who was her costume designer and praised by Joplin in the May 1968 issue of Vogue, Joplin returned to America and formed the [a=Full Tilt Boogie Band], which began touring in May 1970. She also appeared in reunion concerts with [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] at this time. She then began recording a new album in September 1970 with producer [a=Paul A. Rothchild].

By Saturday, October 3rd Joplin had already laid down a number of takes at [l=Sunset Recording Studios] in LA, including ""Mercedes Benz"". On the following day she failed to appear and John Cooke, the road manager of Full Tilt Boogie Band, drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel where Joplin was staying. There he found her dead on the floor of her room, the result of a seizure caused by a heroin overdose.

Joplin was cremated and her ashes scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean. Her unfinished recordings were assembled and the result was the posthumously released [r755239] in 1971. It became the biggest selling album of her career.

Their debut single ""Natural Born Bugie"" became a  hit in the UK Singles Chart and was  followed by the album As Safe As Yesterday Is, which rose to number sixteen in the UK album charts. Their second album, Town and Country was released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of USA. This album featured a more acoustic sound and songs written by all four members.

During 1970 Humble Pie switched to A&M Records who released  the album Humble Pie, later that year which alternated between progressive rock and hard rock. In 1971 A&M released Rock On, and a simultaneous release of a Humble Pie concert recorded at the Fillmore East New York, entitled Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore. Rock On and Performance both went gold and the loud and epic ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" was an FM radio hit in the USA, propelling the album up the charts. 

Frampton left after Rockin' the Fillmore was recorded and was replaced by Dave ""Clem"" Clempson. Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasizing Marriott's blues and soul roots. They recorded the album Smokin', along with two singles ""Hot 'n' Nasty"" and ""30 Days in the Hole"". It was the band's most commercially successful record and reached #6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. A&M then realeased Lost and Found which combined two previous  albums as one. Looking for a more authentic R&B sound, Marriott hired three female backing singers, The Blackberries and the more focused Thunderbox was released in 1974 and Street Rats a year later. In 1975, joined by keyboardist Tim Hinkley, Humble Pie played a Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.

During 1979 Steve Marriott revived Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley, adding Bobby Tench vocalist and guitarist from The Jeff Beck Group and American bassist Anthony ""Sooty"" Jones. Fool for a pretty face proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records. They recorded the album On to Victory which was released in 1980 . Humble Pie toured USA as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill and recorded the album Go for the Throat. At the beginning of this tour Marriott crushed his hand, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a duodenal ulcer forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates. Soon afterwards this line up disbanded.

Drummer Jerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1989 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley, Shirley was the only original performing member. The band began performing concerts and was based in Cleveland, Ohio USA. This time the line up included vocalist Charlie Huhn, who also played lead and rhythm guitar. While Huhn and Shirley were the only permanent members of the group several other musicians appeared from time to time including Wally Stocker formerly of Rod Stewart's band and Cleveland guitarist Alan Greene. They developed a strong reputation as a live act in USA but never released any official studio recordings. They  appeared in the line-up at the Woodstock Festival's 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was broadcast live on national television in the United States and other countries. 

During 1991 when it had appeared that a reunion featuring Frampton and Marriott would happen, Shirley put Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley on hold. After Marriott's death Shirley revived his band which dissolved in 1999. He re-formed Humble Pie again in 2001 with a line up including the original bass player Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench and a new rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell. They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album Back on Track, which comprised new songs and was released by Sanctuary in 2002. A brief tour of UK and Germany with Company of Snakes followed. 

Humble Pie appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the London Astoria during 2001. The concert featured a one of re-union line up of Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley. 

Shirley's 2001 version of the band dissolved in 2002 when Greg Ridley fell ill."

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Notable instruments: Projectron - A device built by Alan Parsons as an analog sample playback device, similar in general concept to a Mellotron. The Projectron consisted of a 24-track tape machine, with each playback channel routed to a voltage controlled amplifier; each VCA was in turn gated by a key of an attached keyboard. The device was used on the albums I Robot, Pyramid, and The Turn of a Friendly Card. But preparing tapes was a cumbersome process and the device was maintenance-intensive, so as soon as a Fairlight CMI became available to Parsons, he switched his sampling activities to that. Parsons scrapped the Projectron sometime after 1980, and no photos of it are known to have survived."
