The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid.

153073,188161,1965407,US,KISS,Sonic Boom,2009,130.93,30,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Glam', 'Heavy Metal']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

The band was formed in Birmingham, England in 1969 by guitarist John Perry (who died shortly after and was replaced by [a=Ernie Chataway]), bassist [a=Bruno Stapenhill], drummer [a=John Partridge (2)], and singer [a=Al Atkins], who created a band name from Bob Dylan's song '[i][r=3881740][/i]'. In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Drummers John Ellis and [a=Chris Campbell (30)] replaced Partridge. Later, in 1973, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Campbell, respectively. A song from the last show with Atkins and Campbell and three from Halford and Hinch's first were released in 2019 on the compilation [m=1794713]. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018. For the Firepower tour he was temporarily replaced by Andy Sneap, making Hill and Halford the only remaining members from the band's early era."

Born 21 December 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
Died 4 December 1993 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Playing in local Chicago punk clubs, the group self-released their debut album, ""Mo' Money, Mo' 40'z"". The band got their first real break when front man Tony Lovato sent the band's album to Goldfinger's John Feldmann who helped them get signed to Maverick Records, and produced their major-label debut, ""Wasting Time"", which was released in July 2000. Since then the band has released three more albums on Maverick —2001's ""Destination Unknown"", 2003's self-titled disc, and 2005's ""Photographs""—and toured the world as part of the Warped Tour.
Tensions between the band members about the musical direction of the band, growing up, starting a family and not wanting to tour as much caused the band to break-up in 2006, and Mest announced their breakup, as well as a farewell tour entitled ""So Long and Thanx for the Booze"".
After spending some time off, Lovato was inspired to start writing music again. He joined up with new guitarist Mike Longworthand new drummer Lil Rich Gonzales. The end result was a series of pop-punk songs that paid tribute to Mest's past, but pushed the band forward into the future. They released a new album, ""Not What You Expected"". Lovato asked Tom Denney from A Day To Remember to co-write a song with him. The track is ""Radio (Something To Believe)"" and is an ode to all the bands that the duo grew up listening to. Jeremy, from A Day To Remember, jumped in the studio to record a part for the song."

The King Diamond band was formed in 1985 by Danish vocalist King Diamond following the break-up of his previous band, [a=Mercyful Fate].  The original line-up consisted of Diamond, his former Mercyful Fate bandmates Michael Denner (guitar) and Timi Hansen (bass), and Swedes Mikkey Dee (drums) and Andy LaRoque (guitar).  This line-up lasted for two albums before Denner and Hansen departed, the first of many line-up changes for the band.  To date, LaRoque is the only musician besides King Diamond to appear on every King Diamond band release.

With the King Diamond band, Diamond traded the occult-based and blasphemous lyrics of Mercyful Fate for a gothic horror approach.  Almost all of the lyrics on King Diamond's albums revolve around a specific story.  Only the band's debut, ""Fatal Portrait,"" and 1995's ""Spider's Lullaby"" stray from this formula, although, even in those cases, several of the songs on the albums feature lyrics that are related to each other.  In 2003, Hungarian vocalist Livia Zita was brought onboard to provide female vocals.  It marked the first time that King Diamond worked with another vocalist on any of his projects (excluding any guest appearances he made on other artists' projects).  King and Livia were later married.

The group saw their commercial success reach its peak in the mid and late 1980's, and their second album, ""Abigail"" is considered a heavy metal classic.  The group was also a target for parents' and watchdog groups who objected to King Diamond's image and what they perceived to be questionable content (although the latter was mostly based on the King's work with Mercyful Fate and his personal connections to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan).  The band has continued to work steadily, although they have been on hold in recent years because of King Diamond's health issues, which include back surgery in 2007, and a triple-bypass in 2010."

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Bradford (bass) as a glam / heavy metal band.

Donny Hart left in 1982 (for the first time), and Terry Glaze abandoned his guitar and became a full-time singer. Later in 1982 Tommy D. Bradford left as well, being replaced by Rex Brown.

In early 1986 Terry Glaze left, and first was replaced by Matt L'Amour on vocals in winter 1986, later by Rick Mythiasin, and later by David Peacock who was the band's vocalist from late spring 1986 to October 1986.

Later David Peacock left and was replaced again by the band's original vocalist Donny Hart, who left in late 1986 and was replaced by Phil Anselmo.

Pantera released four albums in the 1980's (the fourth one, ""Power Metal"" from 1988 features new vocalist, Phil Anselmo). Their early work did not achieve commercial success. In 1990 Pantera released their commercial debut album ""Cowboys from Hell"". Pantera would go on to release two extremely successful albums; ""Vulgar Display of Power"" and ""Far Beyond Driven"". In 2003, three years after Pantera's last studio album, ""Reinventing the Steel"", the band split up after troubles with vocalist Phil Anselmo committing to the band — officially split on November 24th 2003.

On December 8th 2004, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed onstage — while performing with [a=Damageplan] at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, USA — by Nathan Gale, a schizophrenic former U.S. Marine.

Vinnie Paul Abbott passed away on June 22th 2018.

Formed by guitarist Kirk Hammett & drummer Tom Hunting (who initially handled vocals as well). The group was rounded out by guitarist Tim Agnello and bassist Carlton Melson. The line up shifted several times in the early years.

1982 - 1985

In 1982, Exodus included Kirk Hammett and Gary Holt on guitars, Paul Baloff on lead vocals, Geoff Andrews on bass and drummer Tom Hunting. This lineup recorded the band's 1982 demo.

In 1983, founding member Kirk Hammett left Exodus to join Metallica and was replaced by guitarist Rick Hunolt and Rob McKillop replaced Andrews on bass. This line-up recorded and released their debut album, ""Bonded by Blood"" in 1984 (released in 1985).

1986 - 1991

Shortly before the recording of ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" in 1987, Paul Baloff was replaced by Steve ""Zetro"" Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for the San Francisco band Legacy (later known as Testament). Baloff later went on to form the band [a=Piranha (9)].

In 1989, the band released ""Fabulous Disaster"" which garnered good press and, eventually, a major label deal.  That same year, Tom Hunting departed, leaving the group with no founding members.  In 1991 the band released their first live effort, ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", which featured new bassist Mike Butler.

1991 - 1998

After the release of ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", the band toured sporadically for a year and released another studio album, ""Force of Habit"". This album was a departure for the band, containing several slower, ""heavier"" songs with less emphasis on the speed/thrash basis of their older material.  Unable to match the commercial success of some of their peers and dealing with internal stresses and problems, Exodus split in 1994.

After a few dormant years, Exodus released only another live album in 1997 titled ""Another Lesson in Violence"" and featuring the return of vocalist Paul Baloff and new bassist Jack Gibson. Exodus disintegrated again, partly due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

2001 - 2004

In 2001, Exodus reformed again, initially to play the Chuck Billy benefit, the ""Thrash of the Titans"" mega concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local gigs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. In February 2002, Paul Baloff suffered a seizure/stroke from which he eventually died. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments.

Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004's ""Tempo of the Damned"" released on Nuclear Blast.

2005 - Present

In 2005, Hunolt decided to leave the band to concentrate on his family life. He was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also left, citing strong personal objections over some of Holt's anti-Christian lyrics as well as anxiety issues. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph who had previously played with Forbidden, Slayer and Testament.  Souza also left under disputed terms in 2005. 
He was replaced intitially by Steev Esquivel (ex-Defiance and Skinlab) and then later by Rob Dukes whose first recorded performance for the band is 2005's ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine"". 

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007.  In 2012, Rick Hunolt returned in a guest role, filling in for Gary Holt on several live dates while Holt toured with [a=Slayer].  In 2014, Steve Souza returned to the group. He departed again in January 2025, with Rob Dukes returning as vocalist.

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

Regarded as the 'King of Pop,' Michael Jackson was not only a legendary entertainer but also a global icon whose cultural impact reshaped music, dance, and the very fabric of modern society. A visionary singer, songwriter, producer, and performer, his revolutionary work in music videos and sound set new standards for artistic expression, while his groundbreaking choreography continues to inspire artists and performers worldwide. Beyond entertainment, Jackson’s influence spans over 60 academic fields, including economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, cultural studies, medicine, law, and even zoology. His contributions have been the subject of extensive academic research, with studies on topics ranging from the psychology of stardom and human-computer interaction to post-colonialism, biomechanics, and vitiligo awareness. Universities and scholars worldwide explore his work as a transformative force in both popular culture and social change. His ability to unite diverse audiences across continents, with messages of unity, love, and equality, solidified his status as the greatest entertainer of all time. Jackson’s legacy transcends borders, making him one of the most studied and celebrated figures in modern history, whose unprecedented academic influence and far-reaching global impact continue to resonate across generations.

Jackson began his career as the youngest member of [a=The Jackson 5] and started his solo recording career in 1971. Brother of recording artists [a=Jackie Jackson], [a=Janet Jackson], [a=Jermaine Jackson], [a=La Toya Jackson], [a=Marlon Jackson], [a=Randy Jackson], [a=Rebbie Jackson] & [a=Tito Jackson], as well as uncle of [a=3T]. Michael Jackson’s musical achievements are unparalleled, with over 500 million records sold worldwide as a solo artist and 150 million sold as a member of the Jackson 5, solidifying his place as the best-selling solo artist of all time. His groundbreaking albums, including Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, and HIStory, cemented his status as one of the most influential and successful musicians in history. Jackson's innovative approach to music videos, live performances, and genre-blending tracks revolutionized the entertainment industry and left a lasting imprint on global pop culture. His ability to fuse rock, pop, R&B, and soul into chart-topping hits set new standards for creativity and performance. Throughout his career, he became a pioneering force in music, influencing countless artists across various genres. His music continues to resonate with a global fandom spanning nearly 200 countries, and his impact on the evolution of pop music and entertainment as a whole remains immeasurable. Today, it is commonplace for artists to be compared to Michael Jackson, a testament to his enduring legacy

Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 (as performer).

On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he had found Jackson in his room, not breathing and with a barely detectable pulse, and that he administered CPR on Jackson to no avail. After a call was placed to 9-1-1 at 12:21 p.m., Jackson was treated by paramedics at the scene and was later pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center."

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

Cradle of Filth was founded in 1991 as a death metal act, however quickly transitioned to being a second-wave black metal band by the release of their debut album. Since then, the band's musical style has gradually evolved to encompass a wide variety of influences including death, black, gothic and heavy metal. The band's lyrics and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, mythology, occultism, and horror films and have both drawn a fair amount of controversy over the course of their career. The exact sub-genre the band plays is difficult to classify and is often a subject of debate.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

Mike handled drums and vocals while Malefic took care of guitar and bass, but due to lack of funding and only 20 minutes of recording it was not worthy of being distributed. After that incident Mike left. 

In 2001 Xasthur became a one-man project.

On August 28th, 2009, Malefic announced that he would release albums on his own label called Disharmonic Variations, and Xasthur will never release split releases anymore.

On March 26, 2010, Malefic announced that ""Portal of Sorrow"" would be the final Xasthur release and that his next project would be outside the metal genre.

In 2015 Scott announced that the name Xasthur will be used for his new acoustic project.

The band eventually recorded their debut official release, the EP titled ""As Jerusalem Burns...Al' Intisar"" which allowed them to slowly spread through the underground. Unfortunately for the group, their fame slowly got bigger and eventually leaked into the mainstream as newspaper started talking about this unusual Satanist cult. Authorities eventually wanted to arrest the band's progress and they were forced to live the holy cities, as each member slowly moved to the Europe. Lord Curse was unable to move and the band was forced to continue without him. 

In 1999, Absu's Proscriptor joined the band as session drummer for the recording of the band's next release, ""Djinn"".

(Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.) The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years.

The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.

Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers. Another noteworthy aspect of W&C's sound is the absence of drums.

Cradle of Filth was founded in 1991 as a death metal act, however quickly transitioned to being a second-wave black metal band by the release of their debut album. Since then, the band's musical style has gradually evolved to encompass a wide variety of influences including death, black, gothic and heavy metal. The band's lyrics and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, mythology, occultism, and horror films and have both drawn a fair amount of controversy over the course of their career.

In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Drummers John Ellis and [a=Chris Campbell (30)] replaced Partridge. Later, in 1973, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Campbell, respectively. A song from the last show with Atkins and Campbell and three from Halford and Hinch's first were released in 2019 on the compilation [m=1794713]. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018. For the Firepower tour he was temporarily replaced by Andy Sneap, making Hill and Halford the only remaining members from the band's early era."

Jucifer's G. Edgar Livengood and G. Amber Valentine are known for their brutal beauty and fiery intensity on stage and have enjoyed the fruits of their labor as they garner an ever-increasing buzz and the most loyal of fan basses.

Jucifer's first foray in the studio back in 1995 produced songs that would be released on a fan-funded, independently released 7"", Superman B/W Licorice. 1996 saw the duo embarking on their first tour and completing work on their first full-length, Calling All Cars on the Vegas Strip, which didn't see a release until a friend helped fund another independent release in 1998. Calling All Cars..., and the radio singles it produced, caught the attention of Capricorn Records who signed the band 1999 and who would later re-issue Calling All Cars....

The band spent most of '99 writing and recording their Capricorn debut, I Name You Destroyer, and hit the road touring throughout most of 2000 and 2001 in anticipation for its release which wouldn't come for almost two years after its completion. The release of what was to be a 'tour-only' EP, Lambs, did see its release in 2001 but was available in stores as well. 2002 saw the over-due release of I Name You Destroyer. In its wake was a frenzy of critical acclaim and back-breaking touring with Jucifer taking only two months off the entire year.

Jucifer recorded another EP, War Bird, in July of 2003. War Bird would see its release in March of the following year as the band began to compile material for their next full-length. 2004 also saw the release of the band's first home video / DVD, A Partridge In A Pear Tree via AmberVillain Films. The band continued to work on their next full-length, If Thine Enemy Hunger in between performing regularly throughout 2005.

In April of 2006, Jucifer inked a deal with Relapse Records with If Thine Enemy Hunger being their debut release for the label. In 2007, Jucifer finally realized their desire to write and record a double LP worth? of songs based on the French Revolution. This album, L?utrichienne, focuses mainly on French Queen Marie Antoinette, who was executed by guillotine at the height of the revolution, and her relationship with Louis XVI. L?utrichienne, Jucifer's sophomore release for Relapse, will see a March 18th 2008 North American release date, March 24th internationally. Livengood and Valentine have domesticated the term road-warriors by becoming road-homemakers. In 2001, the two purchased a Winnebago that would later replace their stick-n-mortar home allowing them to play shows consistently and consecutively throughout North America.

They've played with such diverse artists as VIC CHESNUTT, THE MELVINS, CHIMAIRA, HIGH ON FIRE, MASTODON, MIKE WATT, MAN OR ASTROMAN, DYSRHTHMIA, ROYAL TUX, BURIED INSIDE and many, many more over the course of their 10+ year touring career. The list of bands they have been compared to reads with similar diversity; MINOR THREAT meets THE CARPENTERS, SLAYER to SLEEP, VERUCA SALT to MY BLOODY VALENTINE, sprinkled with a little PIXIES, PORTISHEAD, PANTERA, NIRVANA and NAPALM DEATH.

Chosen by Alternative Press in 2004 as one of the top 100 bands to watch, Jucifer has a rare ability to bring together fans of almost every genre. Their devotion to intensity and disdain for stylistic rules tends to inspire strong reactions. The dichotomy between Jucifer's lulling, melodic passages, high-volume sludge and brutal machine gun off-time (not to mention the contrast of female vocals alternately siren and banshee) may not appeal to those who like hearing the same old rock music recycled again and again. Amber and Edgar bleed doom, pop, noise and majesty.

Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band.

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009.

Following his departure from synth-metal band Spineshank in 2004, frontman Jonny Santos felt he wanted to move in a different direction musically and start from scratch. Silent Civilian was thus formed and the band faced trouble from the start after experiencing several line-up changes and departing from their original record label Corporate Punishment Records.

The band signed with Mediaskare Records and released their debut record, Rebirth of the Temple, on May 2, 2006. Receiving generally positive reviews, the album has sold more than 25,000 copies since its release in the United States. The band continues to tour supporting the record as Santos one day wants to establish the band as a headlining act. Their line-up consists of Santos (vocals and guitar), Rudy ""Fyto"" Perez (guitar) and Stan Derby (bass). Drummer Chris Mora left the band in late December 2007 due to ""personal reasons"".
Jonny Santos, who is best known as the vocalist and song writer for the Grammy Award nominated synth-metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt it was time to move on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.[1]

Realizing he wanted to start a band from scratch, Santos placed an ad for a drummer on the social networking website MySpace. After receiving a large number of e-mails, Santos received an e-mail from Chris Mora with a video of him drumming. Santos thought ""You can’t be for real, dude"" and asked Mora to come down for the first audition. 10 minutes into the audition Mora was hired as the drummer. Santos auditioned for an Australian band that moved to America called Cryogenic. Although he thought the band was not for him, he met the band's bassist Henno. As Cryogenic and Mudrock, who were working together, had both lost their vocalists, Henno contacted Santos and asked him to join the band, to which Santos accepted. Ryan Ready, who Santos had known since high-school, was recruited as the second guitarist. The band's original name was announced as Silent Civilians, which originates from the world's climate change by that people have opinions on life and politics and they do not voice their beliefs, living in a nation full of 'silent civilians'.[1]


Label and line-up changes
Silent Civilians signed to Corporate Punishment Records in January, 2005 and began work on their debut album, Rebirth of the Temple. However, in May Santos announced they left CPR for reasons he was unable to discuss. The band began talking to several labels after this and pushed the release of their debut to late 2005 or early 2006. The album was recorded at Undercity Recordings, with production duties handled by former Machine Head and Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader, and co-production handled by his partner, Lucas Banker. The band also announced they had changed their name to Silent Civilian.[2] In June, guitarist Ryan Ready left the band due to personal reasons, not relating to the band. Santos sought a replacement, and the following day to Ready's departure set up auditions. Tim Mankowski, who Santos had known for 15 years and played in the band Basic Enigma with him, was hired as the new guitarist.[2]

In November 2005, the band signed with Mediaskare records and planned a tentative release for their debut album for February 21, 2006. At this time, the band had three demo versions of the songs ""Lies in the House of Shame"", ""Divided"" and the title track, ""Rebirth of the Temple"".[3] Mora and Santos were involved in the writing process of the album. While Mora was at work, Santos was at home writing riffs and would create roughly three to four 'skeletons of songs' a week. When Mora finished work, he would help Santos with arrangements, the body of the song, and track it that night and record the vocals and melodies the following day. 30 songs were primarily written for the album as Santos wanted fans to get their moneys worth. 16 songs were recorded that included two cover versions of the thrash metal band Slayer's ""War Ensemble” and Death Angel's ""Seemingly Endless Time"". Although neither cover songs made it onto the album. The length of the CD is 64 minutes, which features the video of the album's title track, and an exclusive 10 minute documentary on the creation process of the album.[4]

Rebirth of the Temple
Silent Civilian released their debut album Rebirth of the Temple on May 2, 2006. Blabbermouth.net reviewer, Scott Alisoglu, thought ""on virtually every track, the group meshes attacking riffs, searing solos, brutal drumming, and melody-drenched bombast"". Although he did not believe it was a 'grand slam', he thought it was a ""pleasant surprise and strong first effort"".[5] Charlie Steffens of KNAC described the album as ""goddamn electric"",[6] while Greg Maki of live-metal.net awarded the album a perfect 10 out of 10 selecting it as his ""best album I have heard so far in 2006.""[7] As of June 5, 2007, Rebirth of the Temple has sold 25,000 copies.[8]

The video for the first single, ""Rebirth of the Temple"", was directed by Scott Culver and was filmed at Santos' childhood home. Santos invited 50 friends over for a party and posted a bulletin that read ""If you’re in the L.A. area, if you’re a Silent Civilian fan, show up at this address"" two hours before filming. This resulted in another 30 people turning up. Static-X front-man Wayne Static, Stone Sour drummer Roy Mayorga and Logan make appearances in the video.[1]

Tim Mankowski departed the band and Henno broke his ankle on an on-stage mishap. The band continued to tour as a three-piece as they sought for a replacement guitarist and bassist as soon as possible — Henno was able to perform on a bar stool temporarily. While touring with Nothingface Santos had met guitarist Marcus Rafferty, who he became friends with and recruited him to replace Mankowski after an audition. Touring partners Bleed the Sky assisted in replacing members for live shows. Bassist Disco Daylen took to the stage replacing Henno and guitarist Kyle Moorman assisted with the replacement of the guitarist by playing half the set and Rafferty would play the other. Santos asked Rafferty if he knew any bass players who were interested in a position, he contacted a friend of his, Stan Derby, who replaced Disco after one month.[4]

In a July 2006 interview with Live-Metal.net, Santos stated the band was planning on recording a tribute EP of cover versions on old Bay Area music, including such bands as Sacred Reich, Death Angel, Exodus and Testament. The band is touring on The Sweet Revenge Tour with Kittie, It Dies Today and Bring Me The Horizon and by the end of the year Santos hopes to establish the band as a headlining act.[4] On December 28, 2007 in a statement released to Blabbermouth.net, Mora explained his departure from the band was based on personal reasons.[9]

A few rehearsal tapes were made and members were kicked. In 1999, after more were kicked out, Malefic found a person called Mike. They did a split MCD with Orosius. Mike handled drums and vocals while Malefic took care of guitar and bass, but due to lack of funding and only 20 minutes of recording it was not worthy of being distributed. After that incident Mike left. 

In 2001 Xasthur became a one-man project.

On August 28th, 2009, Malefic announced that he would release albums on his own label called Disharmonic Variations, and Xasthur will never release split releases anymore.

On March 26, 2010, Malefic announced that ""Portal of Sorrow"" would be the final Xasthur release and that his next project would be outside the metal genre.

In 2015 Scott announced that the name Xasthur will be used for his new acoustic project.

Born out of the ashes of [a=Hellhammer (2)] in June 1984, Celtic Frost was started by Tom G. Warrior (aka Thomas G. Fischer, Vocals/Guitar) and Martin Eric Ain (Bass). Never ones to keep treading the same ground for long, the band progressed from proto-black metal (""Morbid Tales"") to incorporating more classical influences (""To Mega Therion"") and then displaying a more avant-garde streak (""Into The Pandemonium""). In 1988, Warrior fronted a new line up (drummer Stephen Priestly, who played on ""Morbid Tales"" was the only member besides Warrior to have any previous connect to the band) for ""Cold Lake"". Criticized as ""glam metal"" by many of the group's fans, the band's credibility took a huge hit. Blame was later assigned to guitarist Oliver Amberg, who composed much of the album in place of an allegedly uninterested Tom G. Warrior.  Martin Eric Ain returned for 1990's ""Vanity/Nemesis"", but the group folded shortly after.

In the early 2000's, Warrior (now calling himself Thomas G. Fischer) and Ain regrouped with guitarist Erol Unala and drummer Franco Sesa.  Fischer and Ain also revived the [l=Prowling Death Records] imprint, which had previously been used to issue the Hellhammer demos.  Prowling Death would issue the group's new recordings by licensing them through [l=Century Media], starting with 2006's ""Monotheist"" (although the Prowling Death imprint is not featured on the release).  Erol Unala left the group shortly after the release of ""Monotheist"".

Although there were plans to follow up ""Monotheist"", Thomas G. Fischer announced his departure from Celtic Frost in April 2008, citing ""the irresolvable, severe erosion of the personal basis so urgently required to collaborate within a band so unique, volatile, and ambitious"", although he later stated that his friendship with Ain was still intact.

On September 9, 2008, Martin Eric Ain and Tom G. Fischer announced the definite end of Celtic Frost via the band's official homepage.

Final Lineup (2008):

    * Tom Gabriel Fischer – vocals, guitars, programming (1984–2008)

The newly-formed band sought to be the heaviest band ever from Richmond, and took inspiration from traditional doom metal bands (Black Sabbath, Cathedral, Pentagram, Grief, Electric Wizard, Goatsnake), grimy sludge (Sleep, Eyehategod, Cavity) and early metal (Bathory).
The band self-released an EP, ‘The Kingdom’, in 2007, and followed it quickly with their first proper full-length ‘Sigillum Luciferi’ in 2008. Recorded with acclaimed producer Sanford Parker (Minsk, Rwake, Pelican, Nachtmystium), ‘Sigillum Luciferi’ is an ugly, agonizing set of misanthropy set to music. Slight bits of psychedelia had wormed into the massive riffs woven throughout the band's inhuman screams.
Sporadic gigging followed the release before the band holed up in a Richmond warehouse to write the follow-up. Winter 2008 was brutal, the warehouse was filthy and unheated, and the band slowly labored forward with the writing between hospital visits and bouts of near-insanity. By winter 2009/2010, the band had signed to Relapse Records and returned to Chicago, IL, enlisting Parker once again to record the follow-up to ‘Sigillum Luciferi’, ‘Ritual Abuse’.  This was a psychedelic doom album with five tracks of sludge, at some points suffocating and claustrophobic, at others warped and hallucinogenic.
Upon its release, the band embarked on two North American and European tours, lasting almost four months. No sooner did these road warriors return home than they hit the road with Buzzoven and brought their doom to L.A.’s Scion Rock Fest.

Benea Reach was formed on 22 March 2003 by drummer Marco Storm and vocalist Ilkka Volume of Selfmindead fame. They were joined by Morten (bass guitar), Tor (guitar), Erik (guitar), and Anders (Digital Audio). This original incarnation of the band only lasted a year and disbanded. During this time a live demo EP had been recorded.

In 2004 the pair gathered four new members, most notably Christer Espevoll, formerly of [A=Extol]. The band recorded a demo of the song ""Pandemonium"", which was distributed among different record labels. After receiving good responses the band signed a deal with [l=Tabu Recordings] and released their first full-length Monument Bineothan which got the band nominated in the 35th Annual Spellemannsprisen for the metal category against [A=Enslaved], [A=Gorgoroth], and [A=Keep of Kalessin]. In August 2007 the band announced on their website that they would soon be recording their follow-up to ""Monument"" with acclaimed Danish producer Tue Madsen.

On 26 December 2007 via the band's official Myspace, Benea Reach announced their forthcoming album Alleviat, which was released in Scandinavia February 2008.

Around October until November 2008, Benea Reach embarked on tour with The Chariot and The Satire. 

On 14 May 2009 the band confirmed via their official Myspace the departure of guitarist Håkon Sagen, earlier that year.

In October 2009 the band toured India, with concerts at The Great Indian Rock Festival in Pune, Delhi and Bangalore from 23–26 October and at Thomso '09 Cultural Festival of IIT Roorkee on 31 October.

On 11 January 2014, Benea Reach announced that they would be disbanding after their last scheduled shows in March.

ORBS is the coming together of friends with the common goal of opening up their minds to every creative possibility in and outside of each song, challenging the common perception of how a song should be structured, and providing an opportunity for the members to explore common interests in matters of science and wanting to better understand and build a better relationship with the nature/animal community.

Mouth of the Architect formed in 2003 with the lineup of Jason Watkins, Gregory Lahm, Dave Mann, Alex Vernon, and Derik Sommer. They released their first album Time and Withering in 2004 to positive reviews.

Soon after the band released a split with label mates Kenoma in 2006, Vernon left, leaving Lahm to record all the guitar parts on their second album The Ties That Blind which was released in August, and featured Brent Hinds of Mastodon on guest vocals on one track, and bass from Brian Cook of Botch, Russian Circles, and These Arms are Snakes. To support The Ties That Blind, the band toured extensively around the United States, first with These Arms Are Snakes in late 2006, then with 400 Blows and Unsane in May and June 2007.

Their latest album, Quietly, was recorded after Lahm in turn left the band, with Vernon returning alongside newcomer Steve Brooks to jointly handle guitars and vocals, with Kevin Schindel providing bass. Soon after the release of the album by Translation Loss Records, Vernon left yet again, with Schindel filling the guitar void.

Schindel, Vernon, Mann and Brooks have been members of the band Twelve Tribes at various points in the past.

260864,231316,2173050,US,Destruction,Metal Discharge,2003,66.03,18,['Album'],['Rock'],['Thrash'],"Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Weil am Rhein (Germany). 

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

647594,340323,3999628,US,Hell,Human Remains,2011,66.0,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"British NWOBHM band from Nottingham formed in 1982.  During the band's initial run, they garnered much notoriety for their over-the-top performances but struggled to attract label attention, releasing only one obscure single and handful of demos.  A record deal was signed with [l=Mausoleum Records] in 1986 but label went bankrupt mere weeks after the agreement was made, leading guitarist Kev Bower to quit the band. The band replaced Bower and continued on briefly but the 1987 suicide of guitarist/vocalist David G. Halliday effectively ended the band.

Hell had had a profound effect and influence on Andy Sneap: aside from being a fan of the band, he had learned how to play guitar from David G. Halliday and the two formed enough of a friendship that Halliday left both his equipment and the rights to his music to Sneap in his will.  Sneap would co-found the band [a=Sabbat (2)] in the mid 1980s and later become a very prominent and in-demand record producer.  Sneap eventually became reacquainted with the surviving original members of Hell and, in 2008, the band decided to regroup, with Sneap taking up Halliday's guitar duties.  Initially, the band started working with Sabbat's vocalist Martin Walkyier but it was quickly decided that he was not the right fit.  Instead, band ended up recruiting Kev Bower's younger brother, David (a professional actor known by his stage name David Beckford) to handle the vocals.  In 2011, Hell released their first full-length, ""Human Remains"", which consisted primarily of music composed during the band's initial run.  A follow-up, ""Curse and Chapter"", was released in 2013. 

The band quietly split at the end of 2017 after a final run of gigs without making an official statement, disappearing as fast as they returned."

For 51 years the band consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard and bassist and co-lead vocalist Dusty Hill, who was replaced (at his request) by the band's bass technician Elwood Francis after Hill's death on July 28, 2021. The band were formed by former [a684681] members Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell with bassist Lanier Greig, which form they recorded debut single [m329083]. Mitchell and Greig were then almost immediately replaced by former [a1057516] drummer Frank Beard and Billy Etheridge respectively, finalising their classic line-up when Dusty Hill, another former member of American Blues, replaced Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units. ZZ Top also ranks 80th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units."

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

In the beginning their music was described as a fusion between metalcore, nu metal, industrial metal and groove metal, with additional elements of melodic death metal, to form a style the band themselves have described as ""Future Fusion Metal"".

After losing not one, but 2 frontmen and a touring frontman within 5 years, most bands would have called it quits. But not these guys, oh no. They recruited French singer Guillaume Bideau and together they took the band to new heights, releasing the critically heralded album ‘Passenger’ in early 2007.

Relentless touring and hard work got them to the point of a well-respected metal band, but their big break came when they got a chance to open for the mighty Metallica. They played their hearts out during this gig in Denmark and pleased the gods of heavy so much that they were asked to open on a leg of Metallica’s European summer tour. This was a dream chance for any band, but for mnemic it was the chance to show Europe just what a force of heavy metal awesomeness they really are. 

Right now, MNEMIC are either going on hiatus or breaking up. Only future will tell...

The music is at once modern, organic, and other-worldly; songs are stirring sonic journeys channeling the rhythms of the earth and the resonance of the human voice with the synthetic sounds of machines, amplifiers, chaos, and effects. Founded in Peoria in 2002, Minsk has been cultivating sonic exploration and deeply spiritual and emotional outpourings since its inception. The early years were furtive; harboring a locally produced demo (enitled 'Burning'), a West Coast tour, an appearance at the inaugural Templars of Doom Festival in 2004, and a contribution to a Peoria-themed compilation, If It Plays. In early '05, while recording it's first full length ('Out of a Center Which is Neither Dead Nor Alive') at Volume Studios, the band's producer Sanford Parker (PELICAN, UNEARTHLY TRANCE, RWAKE) joined on bass guitar, and the final lineup fell into place. Out of a Center?was released later that year on At A Loss. 2006 saw the band touring from coast to coast in support of Out of a Center? performing with acts as diverse and inspiring as BRUTAL TRUTH, HIGH ON FIRE, BORIS, SUNN0))), TORCHE, PIG DESTROYER, RWAKE, ASSCHAPEL, and BARONESS. Overwhelming press in the likes of Kerrang, Decibel, The Village Voice, Punk Planet, coupled with the band's work ethic and ground-shaking live shows generated an excitement that carried over into SXSW 2006 and the Emissions from the Monolith Festival. By mid-year, MINSK signed with Relapse, and the sophomore full length was underway. The summer and fall found the band pouring over new material and hammering out their Relapse debut, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment at Volume Stduios once again w/ Parker at the helm. Transcending the current crop of heavy music imitators, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment bleeds MINSK's tribal convictions with an atmosphere of total psychedelic delirium. Hypnotic percussion thunders beneath thickly layered guitars as synths and samples provide a backdrop for searing melodies and deeply spiritual vocal ruminations. Superbly produced by bassist/vocalist Parker, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is a profound and provocative experience that will have an intense and lasting impact on all who dare approach.. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment has moved MINSK further into the world of the psychedelic and the progressive. Perhaps more organic and musical than the previous efforts, The Ritual Fires?delves deeper into sophisticated tribal motifs, vocal melodies, and psychedelic passages. Deeply passionate lyrical ruminations about personal struggle, mental illness, societal and generational guilt, the suicidal urge, and philosophical destruction and re-growth echo the sentiments of the varying moods and textures of the hour-long journey. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is scheduled for release by Relapse Records on February 20, 2007. Early tour plans include a trip to SXSW 2007 and an April East Coast tour with brothers/label mates RWAKE. Also in the works are a split 7"" of Roky Erickson covers with label mates UNEARTHLY TRANCE."

Aeternus stands as the creators of an extreme music-style that is defined best as dark metal.
Fast, aggressive, intense and brutal, yet calm and beautiful at times. The lyrics within the realm of Aeternus are to be dark as the music. Thoughts and emotions are usually the main key element behind their darkened lyrics. Bringing up atmospheres of warriors and battles and the mystic and mighty powers of nature. 
In 1994, Aeternus released their one and only demo: ""Walk My Path"", which sold around 400 copies in the underground scene.
In 1995 Aeternus signed a small contract with the Czech label [l=View Beyond Records], who later the same year released the legendary ""Dark Sorcery"" miniCD. This material led to the interest from various labels. In 1996, Aeternus decided to sign with the Dutch label [l=Hammerheart Records]. During the years Aeternus have released several albums and became a strong name in the metal scene worldwide.
Aeternus has always been an active live band and have become a well-established live act.
They have toured with bands such as Deicide, Mayhem, Red Harvest, Cannibal Corpse, Emperor, Aura Noir, Marduk, Behemoth, Limbonic Art, etc. After the 2001 album ""Ascension of Terror"", Aeternus departed with Hammerheart Records. Shortly after Aeternus' crushing performance on the Inferno Festival 2002, the band inked a 3-album deal with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Samoth]Samoth's[/url] [l=Nocturnal Art Productions]. Only one records was released under the NAP banner in the end.
In March 2006 the band released their 6th full-length album through new label mates [l=Dark Essence Records]. The album, entitled ""HeXaeon"" was recorded in Grieghallen Studios, June 2004 with the legendary Pytten as producer, but not released until 2 years later due to some unforeseen hurdles in the process. In February 2006 Erik also decided to throw in the towel after a good 13 years in the band. Shortly after Erik’s departure Aeternus re-emerged as a 4 piece band, introducing 2 new members to the world at the first live appearance in nearly 3 years at Hole In The [l=Sky Festival Bergen].

""Bat Out of Hell"" has sold more than 43 million copies worldwide. After 35 years, it still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the best selling albums of all time.

Although he enjoyed success with ""Bat Out of Hell"" and ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell"" and earned a Grammy Award for 'Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance' for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native US. However, he retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for the number of weeks overall spent on the charts as of 2006. He ranked 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

He was one of the best-selling artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million copies. He has also appeared in over 50 movies and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona.

Two demos, ""Anno Mortiri Domini"" and ""Upon the Viking's Stallion"", were made the following year and soon the band was signed to Napalm Records where they released their first full-length album, ""Lugburz"", which featured Pazuzu, in 1995. After the release Trifixion was kicked out of the band and since then the band focused on keyboard elements rather than drums which was shown on the following album ""Minas Morgul"" which was also released in 1995. 

""Dol Guldur"", the third album, followed in 1997 and once again the lyrics were inspired by Tolkien themes. The EP ""Nightshade Forests"" was also released that year and contained songs that didn't make it on ""Dol Guldur"". After two years silence the band then released ""Stronghold"", which featured Tania Borsky, in 1999. ""Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame"" came in 2001 and was followed by the EP ""Lost Tales"" in 2003.

In 2006, Summoning released their 6th full-length album with the sort title ""Oathbound"". Summoning changed the guitar style and moved to a more opened, floating style in contrary to the staccato style of the album and used more choirs than before.

In 2011, Silenius got a heart infarction which nearly brought Summoning to an end, but with the psychical rehabilitation a new flame arose and Silenius started to compose new material along with Protector. In the year 2013, seven years after the last output, ""Old Mornings Dawn"" saw the light of day. The music of OMD got a much clearer sound, focusing more on details than before. The guitars got deeper and became more old school black metal styled than on all albums before.

Thoughts and emotions are usually the main key element behind their darkened lyrics. Bringing up atmospheres of warriors and battles and the mystic and mighty powers of nature. 
In 1994, Aeternus released their one and only demo: ""Walk My Path"", which sold around 400 copies in the underground scene.
In 1995 Aeternus signed a small contract with the Czech label [l=View Beyond Records], who later the same year released the legendary ""Dark Sorcery"" miniCD. This material led to the interest from various labels. In 1996, Aeternus decided to sign with the Dutch label [l=Hammerheart Records]. During the years Aeternus have released several albums and became a strong name in the metal scene worldwide.
Aeternus has always been an active live band and have become a well-established live act.
They have toured with bands such as Deicide, Mayhem, Red Harvest, Cannibal Corpse, Emperor, Aura Noir, Marduk, Behemoth, Limbonic Art, etc. After the 2001 album ""Ascension of Terror"", Aeternus departed with Hammerheart Records. Shortly after Aeternus' crushing performance on the Inferno Festival 2002, the band inked a 3-album deal with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Samoth]Samoth's[/url] [l=Nocturnal Art Productions]. Only one records was released under the NAP banner in the end.
In March 2006 the band released their 6th full-length album through new label mates [l=Dark Essence Records]. The album, entitled ""HeXaeon"" was recorded in Grieghallen Studios, June 2004 with the legendary Pytten as producer, but not released until 2 years later due to some unforeseen hurdles in the process. In February 2006 Erik also decided to throw in the towel after a good 13 years in the band. Shortly after Erik’s departure Aeternus re-emerged as a 4 piece band, introducing 2 new members to the world at the first live appearance in nearly 3 years at Hole In The [l=Sky Festival Bergen].

With an original new sound and groundbreaking records, after Nuno (ex-Massachusetts bands Sinful - from Hudson and Milford, MA. and Viking) joined, the foursome was immediately recognized as innovators in the world of hard rock & roll. The band has described their music as “Funky Metal” in the early days, but it would evolve much more in the mid-90s by blending classic rock influences with post-grunge and alternative rock.

Wikipedia:
Extreme is an American rock band, headed by frontmen Gary Cherone and Nuno Bettencourt, that reached the height of their popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Among some of Extreme's musical influences are Van Halen, Queen, Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin. The band played at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992 and Cherone joined Van Halen in 1996.[8] The band has described their music as ""funky metal"" in the early days, but it would evolve much more in the mid-1990s by blending classic rock influences with post-grunge and alternative rock.
They have released five studio albums, two EPs (in Japan) and two compilation albums since their formation. The band was one of the most successful rock acts of the early 1990s, selling over 10 million albums worldwide.[9] Extreme achieved their greatest success with their 1990 album Pornograffitti, which peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold in May 1991 and double platinum in October 1992.[10] That album featured the acoustic ballad single ""More Than Words"", which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States."

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

The music is at once modern, organic, and other-worldly; songs are stirring sonic journeys channeling the rhythms of the earth and the resonance of the human voice with the synthetic sounds of machines, amplifiers, chaos, and effects. Founded in Peoria in 2002, Minsk has been cultivating sonic exploration and deeply spiritual and emotional outpourings since its inception. The early years were furtive; harboring a locally produced demo (enitled 'Burning'), a West Coast tour, an appearance at the inaugural Templars of Doom Festival in 2004, and a contribution to a Peoria-themed compilation, If It Plays. In early '05, while recording it's first full length ('Out of a Center Which is Neither Dead Nor Alive') at Volume Studios, the band's producer Sanford Parker (PELICAN, UNEARTHLY TRANCE, RWAKE) joined on bass guitar, and the final lineup fell into place. Out of a Center?was released later that year on At A Loss. 2006 saw the band touring from coast to coast in support of Out of a Center? performing with acts as diverse and inspiring as BRUTAL TRUTH, HIGH ON FIRE, BORIS, SUNN0))), TORCHE, PIG DESTROYER, RWAKE, ASSCHAPEL, and BARONESS. Overwhelming press in the likes of Kerrang, Decibel, The Village Voice, Punk Planet, coupled with the band's work ethic and ground-shaking live shows generated an excitement that carried over into SXSW 2006 and the Emissions from the Monolith Festival. By mid-year, MINSK signed with Relapse, and the sophomore full length was underway. The summer and fall found the band pouring over new material and hammering out their Relapse debut, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment at Volume Stduios once again w/ Parker at the helm. Transcending the current crop of heavy music imitators, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment bleeds MINSK's tribal convictions with an atmosphere of total psychedelic delirium. Hypnotic percussion thunders beneath thickly layered guitars as synths and samples provide a backdrop for searing melodies and deeply spiritual vocal ruminations. Superbly produced by bassist/vocalist Parker, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is a profound and provocative experience that will have an intense and lasting impact on all who dare approach.. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment has moved MINSK further into the world of the psychedelic and the progressive. Perhaps more organic and musical than the previous efforts, The Ritual Fires?delves deeper into sophisticated tribal motifs, vocal melodies, and psychedelic passages. Deeply passionate lyrical ruminations about personal struggle, mental illness, societal and generational guilt, the suicidal urge, and philosophical destruction and re-growth echo the sentiments of the varying moods and textures of the hour-long journey. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is scheduled for release by Relapse Records on February 20, 2007. Early tour plans include a trip to SXSW 2007 and an April East Coast tour with brothers/label mates RWAKE. Also in the works are a split 7"" of Roky Erickson covers with label mates UNEARTHLY TRANCE."

The band toured across the West Coast extensively for the first three years, sharing the stage with prolific electronic, hip-hop, and experimental artists, such as [a=Daedelus], [a=Busdriver], [a=The Album Leaf], [url=https://discogs.com/artist/18128]DJ Nobody[/url], [a=Daddy Kev], [a=The Gaslamp Killer], and [a=Totimoshi]. In June 2006, Zechs Marquise self-released their live demo [i]34:26[/i] EP.

In March 2009, Zechs Marquise traveled overseas, opening on the [a=Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group]'s European tour. The original drummer, [a=Michael Farraro], left in early 2008, soon after completing the band's studio sessions for the debut album, causing Marcel to switch to drums; his youngest brother, [a=Rikardo Rodriguez Lopez], joined the group on keyboards. Zechs Marquise signed with [b][l=Sargent House][/b] artist management agency, which also co-managed Omar's private imprint [b][l=Rodriguez Lopez Productions][/b], the following month. In August 2009, their debut album, [i][m=371288][/i] CD/2×LP, came out on RLP, distributed in Europe by [l=Willie Anderson Recordings]. The band continued extensively touring the United States, solo and opening for [a=Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group] and [a=RX Bandits]. Their sophomore album, [i][m=434052][/i], was released in September 2011. Zechs Marquise has been on a lengthy hiatus since 2013.

5125,8304,319209,US,Foetus,Flow,2001,62.8,11,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock']","['New Wave', 'Industrial']","[b]Foetus[/b] is a main solo project and 'one-man band' of Australian polystylistic composer, multi-instrumentalist, experimental sound artist and producer [a=J.G. Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

Cudi first gained major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi (2008). The mixtape caught the attention of American rapper-producer Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint in late 2008. Cudi has since gone on to launch his own record label imprints, the now-dissolved Dream On and current independent label, Wicked Awesome Records. Initially a rapper, Cudi has since added singer, songwriter, record producer, guitarist, music video director and film composer to his repertoire.

As of 2018, Cudi has released six studio albums as a solo artist. In 2008, his debut single ""Day 'n' Nite"", led him to prominence, reaching the top five of the Billboard charts. Cudi's debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009) was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2010, he released Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, which was preceded by ""Erase Me"" and ""Mr. Rager"". Later that year, Cudi formed a rock band, now known as WZRD, with his long-time collaborator Dot da Genius, releasing one eponymous debut album, in early 2012. The album debuted at number one on the Top Rock Albums chart.[4][5] In April 2013, Cudi released Indicud, which became his highest-charting album on multiple charts. In February 2014, Cudi unexpectedly released his fourth album, Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, exclusively to digital retailers with no promotion. In 2015, Cudi released his rock album Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven to negative reception. In 2016, he returned to hip-hop with his sixth album, Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin' to critical acclaim. Cudi later released a joint album with West under the eponymous name Kids See Ghosts.

Kid Cudi has sold over 5.2 million digital singles and has worked with numerous prominent artists in the music industry, including Jay Z, Mary J. Blige, David Guetta, MGMT, Shakira, Snoop Dogg and Michael Bolton, among others. With his originality and creativity, as well as the emotion he conveys in his music, Cudi has amassed a large cult-like following among high school students, college students and stoners alike. In 2010, Cudi ventured into acting when he began starring in the HBO series How to Make It in America. Cudi has since appeared in several feature films, including Goodbye World, Need for Speed and Entourage. In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as One Tree Hill, The Cleveland Show and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. In 2015, he was the bandleader on the IFC series, Comedy Bang! Bang!.

Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums.

After a landmark appearance at the Monterey Pop festival, their debut album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Are-You-Experienced/master/24497]Are You Experienced[/url] was released in September 1967.

A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

After losing not one, but 2 frontmen and a touring frontman within 5 years, most bands would have called it quits. But not these guys, oh no. They recruited French singer Guillaume Bideau and together they took the band to new heights, releasing the critically heralded album ‘Passenger’ in early 2007.

Relentless touring and hard work got them to the point of a well-respected metal band, but their big break came when they got a chance to open for the mighty Metallica. They played their hearts out during this gig in Denmark and pleased the gods of heavy so much that they were asked to open on a leg of Metallica’s European summer tour. This was a dream chance for any band, but for mnemic it was the chance to show Europe just what a force of heavy metal awesomeness they really are. 

Right now, MNEMIC are either going on hiatus or breaking up. Only future will tell...

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

After a standout performance at the famous CBGB in Manhattan, New York the band signed with Elektra Records. They gained nationwide exposure with their debut album, Laced, in 1999. The album featured a guest appearance by Cypress Hill rapper B-Real. The band played Warped Tour 1999, Woodstock 1999, and Ozzfest 2000, and toured with Godsmack, Machine Head, and Powerman 5000.

Reveille's follow-up album, Bleed the Sky was released in 2001. The album featured appearances from Taproot singer Stephen Richards and Cold singer Scooter Ward; the collaboration for which Reveille achieved Billboard success with their song ""Inside Out (Can You Feel Me Now)"". Also in 2001 the group received the Boston Music Award for ""Rising Star"" and then embarked on a tour with Static-X. The following year Bleed the Sky was nominated for Boston Music Award's ""Album of the Year"".

In 2002, their original guitarist, Greg Sullivan, decided to leave the band citing ""creative differences"". He was replaced by Chris Turner. Though initially announcing the band would be releasing a third album through Elektra Records, once again enlisting the help of producer Howard Benson, this album never saw release and they soon departed the label. Singer Drew Simollardes claimed Reveille had been pressured to make more accessible radio-oriented music by the label, stating ""Our biggest problem was always battling with people at the label. They were kind of trying to market us to 12 year old girls and it didn't work. That was our big problem with them.""[1] Reveille did one tour with Sevendust before breaking up in 2003.[2] Their final show was the ""3rd Annual Hometown Throwdown"" at the Palladium in Worcester, Massachusetts on December 28, 2002 where they performed two live new songs titled ""Your Life"" & ""Nothing No One"" that was originally supposed to be for their third album."

Shortly after, UT parted ways with original drummer [a1105762] and replaced him with [a604158].

To coincide with their full United States tour with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/341539-Electric-Wizard-2]Electric Wizard[/url] in 2002, Unearthly Trance released a limited tour CDr entitled [r=6428413]. Following that release, [r=897103] was released on 7"" vinyl via [l65717]. The band unleashed their first proper album, [m=13066], in the fall of 2003. It was recorded with ""drone magus"" [a214033], who assisted in the subsonic mixing.The CD was released in Europe by [a254674]'s [l33456] and in the US by [l1102], with a limited vinyl version available the following year by [l65717].

Their sophomore album [m=13120] was released on CD in Europe in November 2004, again through [l33456], who also handled the vinyl pressing this time around. The US CD edition was again put out by [l1102]. Their third full-length and [l3949] debut, [m=13124] was released on April 4th, 2006. To record the album, UT reunited with [a363456] and recorded the main tracks at [a59373]'s studio [l269885]. The band performed a handful of live shows in support of [m=13124]  throughout 2006 and 2007, including a month-long European tour just prior to beginning work on a new album. In the latter half of 2007, the band called up [a363456] once again to record their next full-length release, [m=13129], at his studio [l314641] in Chicago, IL. The album was released on March 19th, 2008.

The music is at once modern, organic, and other-worldly; songs are stirring sonic journeys channeling the rhythms of the earth and the resonance of the human voice with the synthetic sounds of machines, amplifiers, chaos, and effects. Founded in Peoria in 2002, Minsk has been cultivating sonic exploration and deeply spiritual and emotional outpourings since its inception. The early years were furtive; harboring a locally produced demo (enitled 'Burning'), a West Coast tour, an appearance at the inaugural Templars of Doom Festival in 2004, and a contribution to a Peoria-themed compilation, If It Plays. In early '05, while recording it's first full length ('Out of a Center Which is Neither Dead Nor Alive') at Volume Studios, the band's producer Sanford Parker (PELICAN, UNEARTHLY TRANCE, RWAKE) joined on bass guitar, and the final lineup fell into place. Out of a Center?was released later that year on At A Loss. 2006 saw the band touring from coast to coast in support of Out of a Center? performing with acts as diverse and inspiring as BRUTAL TRUTH, HIGH ON FIRE, BORIS, SUNN0))), TORCHE, PIG DESTROYER, RWAKE, ASSCHAPEL, and BARONESS. Overwhelming press in the likes of Kerrang, Decibel, The Village Voice, Punk Planet, coupled with the band's work ethic and ground-shaking live shows generated an excitement that carried over into SXSW 2006 and the Emissions from the Monolith Festival. By mid-year, MINSK signed with Relapse, and the sophomore full length was underway. The summer and fall found the band pouring over new material and hammering out their Relapse debut, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment at Volume Stduios once again w/ Parker at the helm. Transcending the current crop of heavy music imitators, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment bleeds MINSK's tribal convictions with an atmosphere of total psychedelic delirium. Hypnotic percussion thunders beneath thickly layered guitars as synths and samples provide a backdrop for searing melodies and deeply spiritual vocal ruminations. Superbly produced by bassist/vocalist Parker, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is a profound and provocative experience that will have an intense and lasting impact on all who dare approach.. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment has moved MINSK further into the world of the psychedelic and the progressive. Perhaps more organic and musical than the previous efforts, The Ritual Fires?delves deeper into sophisticated tribal motifs, vocal melodies, and psychedelic passages. Deeply passionate lyrical ruminations about personal struggle, mental illness, societal and generational guilt, the suicidal urge, and philosophical destruction and re-growth echo the sentiments of the varying moods and textures of the hour-long journey. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is scheduled for release by Relapse Records on February 20, 2007. Early tour plans include a trip to SXSW 2007 and an April East Coast tour with brothers/label mates RWAKE. Also in the works are a split 7"" of Roky Erickson covers with label mates UNEARTHLY TRANCE."

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

63108,396404,2293336,US,Jars Of Clay,The Long Fall Back to Earth,2009,58.98,14,['Album'],['Rock'],['Pop Rock'],"Jars of Clay began at Greenville College, Illinois, in 1992 (though they weren't using that name at this stage). In those early days, Charlie Lowell and Dan Haseltine were joined by [a=Matt Bronleewe] after discovering they shared similar musical tastes, and began working on various studio projects as well as performing with different college bands. In 1993, Stephen Mason was accepted into the college due to the strength of his audition piece 'Frail' (then an instrumental guitar track), and met Dan because of a Toad The Wet Sprocket t-shirt he was wearing, the two sharing an admiration for that band's unique sound. This original foursome then decided to write and record a song together purely for credit in a recording class. That song, 'Fade To Grey' became popular throughout the college, and the band performed it the 'Underground Cafe'. After the success of this performance, they decided to write more songs to add to their repertoire as well as to continue satisfying their course criteria. They also decided that if they were going to continue performing, they needed to give themselves a name. Charlie recalled a verse from 2 Corinthians 4:7 that included the phrase 'Jars of Clay' and the band decided that this would be a good way to remind themselves to stay humble. In 1994, Jars of Clay was born.

Also in 1994, Charlie suggested to the band that they enter a talent contest he had seen advertised in a CCM magazine. On April 27th, Jars of Clay performed at the Gospel Music Association Spotlight Competition, and met with great popular and critical praise. April continued to be busy as the band released its demo album ""Frail"", (which was limited to a run of 1000 and is now the most highly sought after piece of Jars of Clay memorabilia). This demo, combined with their GMA win, garnered the band a lot of record label interest, and eventually they signed with [l=Essential Records (3)], then a small, fledgling label that nevertheless had the distribution power of both Brentwood Music and Silvertone. By this stage, Matt Bronleewe had decided to leave the band and continue his studies, rather than move with the others to Nashville to record their debut album. This left a hole in the group that was filled when Charlie called an old school friend of his, Matt Odmark, and asked him if he would be interested in the spot. Matt accepted and in May 1995 they released their self-titled debut to massive critical and popular acclaim. The first single to be lifted from the album, 'Flood', became a No. 1 hit on both secular and Christian charts, helping the album go 2x Platinum, and seeing the band tour with the likes of Sting, Sheryl Crowe, Michael W. Smith and PFR.

Jars of Clay are considered to be one of the most creative and artistic bands in the US, and not only amongst Christian audiences. Though their name is not as prevalent in the secular scene as it once was, it is still associated with the very highest of production values and creative output, and the band still maintains a very loyal and dedicated fan base, and have performed all over the world, including Australia, the UK, the Philippines, and Singapore. In 2001, Jars of Clay received Honourary Degrees from Greenville College, since Dan, Charlie and Steve never finished their original degrees. The band has always been open about their Christian beliefs, but do not consider themselves to be a 'Christian' band, more a band whose members are Christians. All four men are now married and most have started families of their own. When touring, the group is expanded to include a drummer (formerly Scott Savage and [a=Joe Porter (2)], currently [a=Jeremy Lutito]) and a bassist (formerly [a=Aaron Sands], currently [a=Gabe Ruschival]), and on occasion has included string players. Jars of Clay continue to be one of the most influential bands in the CCM industry as well as maintaining a high degree of respect in the music industry in general."

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

On August 28th, 2009, Malefic announced that he would release albums on his own label called Disharmonic Variations, and Xasthur will never release split releases anymore.

On March 26, 2010, Malefic announced that ""Portal of Sorrow"" would be the final Xasthur release and that his next project would be outside the metal genre.

In 2015 Scott announced that the name Xasthur will be used for his new acoustic project.

273827,258504,2643756,Europe,Overkill,Ironbound,2010,57.8,10,"['Album', 'Limited Edition']",['Rock'],['Thrash'],"Speed/Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from New Jersey (USA).

The band known for rejecting several names, which includes ""Virgin Killer"", this new band finally settled on ""Overkill"", naming themselves after a [a233658] album.
Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

People from all over the world, from all walks of life and from all age groups have become fans of Blue Man Group's show in New York, Boston, Chicago, Las Vegas, Orlando, Berlin, Tokyo, and Basel.

Blue Man Group is also known for its unique style of music which is played on a variety of invented instruments. Blue Man Group's 1999 debut album, AUDIO was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category. One reviewer called it ""a glorious wall of sound.""

Blue Man Group released their highly anticipated second album, ""The Complex"", which served as a bit of a departure for the enigmatic performers. The subsequent Complex Rock Tour has been hailed as “awesome musicianship enhanced by unadulterated good humor and fun” by The Chicago Sun-Times.

In addition to live shows and music, Blue Man Group has created installations, ""happenings,"" ""unusual ads,"" a number of television-specific performances for ""The Tonight Show"" (several of which were nominated for Emmy awards) and have most recently ventured into toy development.

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

The newly-formed band sought to be the heaviest band ever from Richmond, and took inspiration from traditional doom metal bands (Black Sabbath, Cathedral, Pentagram, Grief, Electric Wizard, Goatsnake), grimy sludge (Sleep, Eyehategod, Cavity) and early metal (Bathory).
The band self-released an EP, ‘The Kingdom’, in 2007, and followed it quickly with their first proper full-length ‘Sigillum Luciferi’ in 2008. Recorded with acclaimed producer Sanford Parker (Minsk, Rwake, Pelican, Nachtmystium), ‘Sigillum Luciferi’ is an ugly, agonizing set of misanthropy set to music. Slight bits of psychedelia had wormed into the massive riffs woven throughout the band's inhuman screams.
Sporadic gigging followed the release before the band holed up in a Richmond warehouse to write the follow-up. Winter 2008 was brutal, the warehouse was filthy and unheated, and the band slowly labored forward with the writing between hospital visits and bouts of near-insanity. By winter 2009/2010, the band had signed to Relapse Records and returned to Chicago, IL, enlisting Parker once again to record the follow-up to ‘Sigillum Luciferi’, ‘Ritual Abuse’.  This was a psychedelic doom album with five tracks of sludge, at some points suffocating and claustrophobic, at others warped and hallucinogenic.
Upon its release, the band embarked on two North American and European tours, lasting almost four months. No sooner did these road warriors return home than they hit the road with Buzzoven and brought their doom to L.A.’s Scion Rock Fest.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

[a266100] was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release."

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

In 2006, Summoning released their 6th full-length album with the sort title ""Oathbound"". Summoning changed the guitar style and moved to a more opened, floating style in contrary to the staccato style of the album and used more choirs than before.

In 2011, Silenius got a heart infarction which nearly brought Summoning to an end, but with the psychical rehabilitation a new flame arose and Silenius started to compose new material along with Protector. In the year 2013, seven years after the last output, ""Old Mornings Dawn"" saw the light of day. The music of OMD got a much clearer sound, focusing more on details than before. The guitars got deeper and became more old school black metal styled than on all albums before.

When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

""Towards The Sinister"" was the band's first recording ever, an early demo which immediately got them a deal for their first real release, the classic EP ""Symphonaire Infernus Et Spera Empyrium"".

""Turn Loose The Swans"" and ""The Angel And The Dark River"" (released in 1994 and 1996 respectively) followed the original album's success, but took the band's style further, mixing all sorts of different musical styles together. 

Despite My Dying Bride's quite evident commercial success the band never stopped experimenting (1998's ""34.788%...Complete"" demonstrating this more than any other release) and has now settled with it's own original style which differs quite a lot from other band's, even though it has given birth to many pioneers (and some say a whole subgenre!).

After much unsigned work under some aliases, the CCO label saw fit to release his debut mini-album, ""Far Away Trains Passing By"". The album became a critical hit and gained more and more listeners through the next couple years as it seeped into the far East and America. Due to strong word-of-mouth and a devoted following, his follow-up album, ""A Strangely Isolated Place"", was an even bigger hit. He has also started branching out with collaborations and remixes with Longview, Mojave 3, I'm Not A Gun, Justin Robertson, The Zephyrs, and more.

The band released five studio albums, earned six Grammy Awards and two Brits, and was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.
One of the early bands Sumner played with was [a=The Phoenix Jazzmen]. He once performed wearing a black and yellow jersey with hooped stripes that bandleader [a=Gordon Solomon] had noted made him look like a bumblebee; thus Sumner became ""Sting"". He uses Sting almost exclusively, except on official documents. In a press conference, he once jokingly stated that even his children call him Sting.
In 1988, he established [l52368].
As one of the world’s most distinctive solo artists, Sting has received an additional 11 Grammy Awards, two Brits, a Golden Globe, an Emmy, four Oscar nominations (most recently for “The Empty Chair” from JIM: The James Foley Story), a TONY nomination, Billboard Magazine’s Century Award, and MusiCares 2004 Person of the Year. In 2002, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors and was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2003, Sting received a CBE from Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for services to music. In December 2014 he received the Kennedy Center Honors, and most recently was given The American Music Award of Merit. Throughout his enduring career, he has sold close to 100 million albums from his combined work with The Police and as a solo artist.
Sting’s support for human rights organizations such as the Rainforest Fund, Amnesty International and Live Aid mirrors his art in its universal outreach.  Along with wife [a=Trudie Styler], Sting founded the Rainforest Fund in 1989 to protect both the world’s rainforests and the indigenous people living there. Together they have held 17 benefit concerts to raise funds and awareness for our planet’s endangered resources.
Received the Polar Music Prize 2017.
In 2019, Sting was honoured at the BMI Pop Awards for his enduring hit single “Every Breath You Take,” which has become the most performed song, with 15 million radio plays, from BMI’s catalog of over 14 million musical works.
In May 2023, he was made an Ivor Novello Fellow.
Sting married actress [a=Frances Tomelty] from Northern Ireland, on 1 May 1976. Before they divorced in 1984, they had two children: Joseph (""[a880220]"") (born 23 November 1976) and Fuchsia Katherine (""[a=Kate Sumner]"", born 17 April 1982). In 1982, after the birth of his second child, he separated from Tomelty and began living with actress and film producer [a=Trudie Styler]. The couple married at Camden Register Office on 20 August 1992.

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

Their first release, the 2003 EP Hunted, was made available only from CD Baby, the iTunes Store, and the band themselves. It was enough to attract the attention of Elektra Records, who released their self-titled album the following July. Unfortunately for the band, however, Elektra's parent company, Warner Music Group, was sold in February 2004 to a group of private investors, who decided to fold Elektra into Atlantic Records, and many of the labels' underperforming acts, including Year of the Rabbit, were dropped from their rosters.

[a266100] was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release."

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002.

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

The same night they were formed they also recorded their first demo, ""The Art of Dying"". It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

A Vast Field of Silence is the Chicagoans fourth LP, and four years in the making. The thematic record is a wordless concept album, based around a recurring melody appearing throughout. Most clearly stated in the album opener ‘Awareness’, the beautiful theme is typical of Outrun the Sunlight, an unusually cinematic and compositionally-heavy group in the genre.

Although anchored to the theme, A Vast Field of Silence is a satisfyingly surprising record, one that is a journey of a listen. Going beyond simply instrumental progressive, the band incorporate elements of acoustic ambient, jazz, post-rock, and metal. Bearing comparisons to Cloudkicker, The Contortionist, and Russian Circles, A Vast Field of Silence is Outrun the Sunlight at their best.
 
The band have a huge depth and range of musical talent at their disposal: Kyle Kunkler (keys) is a professional dance piano accompanist (ballet, modern, and more) and composer, and custom-coded a majority of the synths heard on the album. Luke Angle (drummer) is a professional music instructor, from big-band jazz to math rock via country & western. Phil Kalas (bass) is also a composer, under the name Asleep In The Stars, while guitarists, Cody McCarty and Austin Peters formed the group in 2011, and have known each other since playing together in high school bands from 2008. Austin, aside from Outrun the Sunlight, has also practiced embodiment meditation since 2017, and is the founder of “Simple Being”, which produces recorded meditations with voice and ambient music.
 
With forming in 2011, the band released both Architecture of the Cosmos EP and debut LP The Return of Inertia in the same year. Signing with Rogue Records America in 2012, the duo re-released The Return of Inertia (Vocalist Version) which included vocalists from around the world, plus two bonus tracks. In 2014, the addition of drummer, Pedro Villegas, and bassist, Connor Grant, brought the band to the stage, and they released their second album Terrapin also on Rogue Records. In August 2015, following the release of Live at Electrical Audio EP, the group toured in the east coast United States with Native Construct (Metal Blade Records) and Wings Denied.

In 2016 Outrun the Sunlight went on to perform on Chicago internet music series, Audiotree, releasing the live album Outrun the Sunlight on Audiotree Live. They then released Red Bird independently in 2017, their third LP, the first instance that the group performed together on an album. A band not content to rest, they then released a live in-studio record, Emerge, in January 2021.
 
With the Covid-19 interruption and introduction of a new drummer, Outrun the Sunlight’s newest LP has eventually been four years in the making, from first conception ‘til release – but well worth the long wait.

It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

The band formed by Ralf Scheepers and members of Sinner (Ger) after he left Gamma Ray to (unsuccesfully) audition for Judas Priest. Ralf previously filled in for Helloween on tour in 1986 when Kai Hansen had difficulty continuing as both guitarist and vocalist. After the tour he knocked back the offer of the job full-time (it would of course then go to Michael Kiske).

Primal Fear split with Nuclear Blast in 2006 after Mat Sinner left his job as a label rep with the company in January.

Henny Wolter rejoined Primal Fear in 2007, replacing Tom Naumann for the second time. Naumann's departure has not been clarified. The band's other longtime guitarist, Stefan Leibing, departed in February 2008 to spend more time with his family.

Though the band's first album was a success, Machine Head had a series of albums that earned the band criticism for ""selling out"". With 5 former members, the band nearly disbanded in 2002 after [a=Roadrunner Records] dropped them. The band re-signed soon after and had a stable line-up from 2003-2013, also including former [a=Vio-Lence] member [a=Phil Demmel]. In 2007 Machine Head recieved a Grammy Award nomination for their album ""The Blackening"".

As of 2013 the line-up became unstable again with the departures of 3 long-time members;
[a=Adam Duce] left in 2013 after 21 years
[a=Dave McClain] left in 2018 after 24 years
[a=Phil Demmel] left in 2018 after 16 years

In 2019 Flynn announced a 25th anniversary tour of the band debut album ""Burn My Eyes"", where the band would play 2 sets with 2 tour line-ups; one performing the ""Burn My Eyes"" record in its entirety featuring former members [a=Logan Mader] and [a=Chris Kontos] joining him and Jared, and another set where the band would perform other MH songs, with Robb and Jared being joined by guitarist [a=Wacław Kiełtyka] (of [a=Decapitated]) and drummer [a=Matt Alston] (of [a=Sanctorum]).

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

On their previous album The Walk you will find the song ""Great Divide"" that can be downloaded via the internet and the proceeds of which go to HIV / AIDS and poverty alleviation in Africa.

Staging some of the releases, the band produced both limited and common vinyl, CD's, digital copies, and an Instrumentals-only version of ""Introducing..."".

In 2012 the band announced plans for an third album tentatively titled ""III"" and an experimental cover album named ""EXPERIMEDUCATION VOL. I"".

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

He was a Canadian poet, singer and songwriter. The father of [a290771] and [a1848518].

His first collection of poetry, [i]Let Us Compare Mythologies[/i], was published in 1956, followed by [i]The Spice Box of Earth[/i] in 1961. After traveling throughout Europe, he settled on the Greek island of Hydra, where he stayed for seven years. There he wrote another collection of poetry, [i]Flowers for Hitler[/i] (1964), and two novels, [i]The Favorite Game[/i] (1963) and [i]Beautiful Losers[/i] (1966). In 1967, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk musician. In 1994, Cohen retreated to the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles, beginning what became five years of seclusion at the center. In 1996, Cohen was ordained as a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk and took the Dharma name ""Jikan"", meaning ""silence"".

During his lifetime he recorded 14 studio albums. A tribute [url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Im-Your-Fan-The-Songs-Of-Leonard-Cohen-By/master/3820]album[/url] with 18 songs was released in 1991, featuring [a74500], [a66358], [a31844], [a37859], [a231577], [a107077] and [a45641] among others.

One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone.

Known as ""Van the Man"" by his fans, Morrison started his musical career as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, penning their seminal 1964 hit ""Gloria"". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career. (In 1966 he moved to the USA, first to New York City. In 1968 he lived 9 months in Cambridge near Boston. Early Autumn 1968, he recorded Astral Weeks in New York, then moving to Woodstock. In the spring of 1971 he moved to California, settling in the leafy Marin County town of Fairfax, where he built his own Caledonia Studios. Morrison has moved house a lot. By 1977 he's living in Brentwood near Los Angeles, later it's Sausalito, ... Morrison would revisit Ireland and the UK, e.g. buying a house in Bath, England.)

Van Morrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2000, Morrison ranked #25 on American cable music channel VH1's list of its 100 greatest artists of rock and roll, and in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Van Morrison 42nd on their list of The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The Craving was originally released in 1996, however, it was remastered in 2004 when Dave Mustaine remixed & remastered the Megadeth back catalog. The remaster does not include Lee Ving's original vocal tracks or harmonica parts due to the master tapes being lost. So, instead of tracking down Lee and re-recording his vocals and harmonica, Dave did the vocals and simulated the harmonica on guitar.

The MD in MD.45 is Dave Mustaine's initials backwards and the 45 is Lee Ving's reversed initials in Roman numerals.

Dave Mustaine, wanted to create an album showcasing a different musical style than Megadeth. 

MD.45 History

The first (and only) album released was The Craving in Japan first on May 29, 1996 and in other nations on July 23, 1996.

Almost a decade later, while Capitol Records was releasing remastered versions of Megadeth's back catalog, Dave Mustaine chose to remaster The Craving. According to the liner notes, during the remastering process, it was realized that the vocal track and harmonica track were missing.

To complete the remaster,  Mustaine chose to do the vocals himself and simulate the harmonica parts on the guitar.

Lineup

    * Dave Mustaine - Guitar, Vocals (on remastered)
    * Kelly LeMieux - Bass

Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer.

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009.

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

- Walter Broide: Drums & Vocals
- Gonzalo Villagra: Bass

Formed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Los Natas put the second largest South American nation on the world's stoner rock map almost single-handedly. Coming together in the mid-90's, guitarist/vocalist Sergio Chotsourian, bassist Miguel Fernandez and drummer Walter Broide displayed a distinct Kyuss obsession on their 1996 debut Delmar, which was sung almost exclusively in Spanish. But subsequent releases such as 1999's Ciudad de Brahman and 2002's Corsario Negro (featuring new bassist Gonzalo Villagra) quickly expanded upon this oft-borrowed blueprint, adding sonic elements culled from space rock, psychedelia and even jazz, meshing and elevating them all to heights arguably never scaled south of the Equator. Not content to sit on their laurels, the group's 2003's Toba Trance delved into Indian music over the course of three songs spread over sixty-minutes.

In those early days, Charlie Lowell and Dan Haseltine were joined by [a=Matt Bronleewe] after discovering they shared similar musical tastes, and began working on various studio projects as well as performing with different college bands. In 1993, Stephen Mason was accepted into the college due to the strength of his audition piece 'Frail' (then an instrumental guitar track), and met Dan because of a Toad The Wet Sprocket t-shirt he was wearing, the two sharing an admiration for that band's unique sound. This original foursome then decided to write and record a song together purely for credit in a recording class. That song, 'Fade To Grey' became popular throughout the college, and the band performed it the 'Underground Cafe'. After the success of this performance, they decided to write more songs to add to their repertoire as well as to continue satisfying their course criteria. They also decided that if they were going to continue performing, they needed to give themselves a name. Charlie recalled a verse from 2 Corinthians 4:7 that included the phrase 'Jars of Clay' and the band decided that this would be a good way to remind themselves to stay humble. In 1994, Jars of Clay was born.

Also in 1994, Charlie suggested to the band that they enter a talent contest he had seen advertised in a CCM magazine. On April 27th, Jars of Clay performed at the Gospel Music Association Spotlight Competition, and met with great popular and critical praise. April continued to be busy as the band released its demo album ""Frail"", (which was limited to a run of 1000 and is now the most highly sought after piece of Jars of Clay memorabilia). This demo, combined with their GMA win, garnered the band a lot of record label interest, and eventually they signed with [l=Essential Records (3)], then a small, fledgling label that nevertheless had the distribution power of both Brentwood Music and Silvertone. By this stage, Matt Bronleewe had decided to leave the band and continue his studies, rather than move with the others to Nashville to record their debut album. This left a hole in the group that was filled when Charlie called an old school friend of his, Matt Odmark, and asked him if he would be interested in the spot. Matt accepted and in May 1995 they released their self-titled debut to massive critical and popular acclaim. The first single to be lifted from the album, 'Flood', became a No. 1 hit on both secular and Christian charts, helping the album go 2x Platinum, and seeing the band tour with the likes of Sting, Sheryl Crowe, Michael W. Smith and PFR.

Jars of Clay are considered to be one of the most creative and artistic bands in the US, and not only amongst Christian audiences. Though their name is not as prevalent in the secular scene as it once was, it is still associated with the very highest of production values and creative output, and the band still maintains a very loyal and dedicated fan base, and have performed all over the world, including Australia, the UK, the Philippines, and Singapore. In 2001, Jars of Clay received Honourary Degrees from Greenville College, since Dan, Charlie and Steve never finished their original degrees. The band has always been open about their Christian beliefs, but do not consider themselves to be a 'Christian' band, more a band whose members are Christians. All four men are now married and most have started families of their own. When touring, the group is expanded to include a drummer (formerly Scott Savage and [a=Joe Porter (2)], currently [a=Jeremy Lutito]) and a bassist (formerly [a=Aaron Sands], currently [a=Gabe Ruschival]), and on occasion has included string players. Jars of Clay continue to be one of the most influential bands in the CCM industry as well as maintaining a high degree of respect in the music industry in general."

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

94612,1653,305878,US,The Album Leaf,In A Safe Place,2004,50.97,12,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock']","['IDM', 'Post Rock']","THE ALBUM LEAF has been making its mark as a soft-spoken innovator steadily and surely since 1999. One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

In the beginning their music was described as a fusion between metalcore, nu metal, industrial metal and groove metal, with additional elements of melodic death metal, to form a style the band themselves have described as ""Future Fusion Metal"".

After losing not one, but 2 frontmen and a touring frontman within 5 years, most bands would have called it quits. But not these guys, oh no. They recruited French singer Guillaume Bideau and together they took the band to new heights, releasing the critically heralded album ‘Passenger’ in early 2007.

Relentless touring and hard work got them to the point of a well-respected metal band, but their big break came when they got a chance to open for the mighty Metallica. They played their hearts out during this gig in Denmark and pleased the gods of heavy so much that they were asked to open on a leg of Metallica’s European summer tour. This was a dream chance for any band, but for mnemic it was the chance to show Europe just what a force of heavy metal awesomeness they really are. 

Right now, MNEMIC are either going on hiatus or breaking up. Only future will tell...

273827,106119,1767648,US,Overkill,ReliXIV,2005,50.65,10,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Thrash', 'Speed Metal']","Speed/Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from New Jersey (USA).

The band known for rejecting several names, which includes ""Virgin Killer"", this new band finally settled on ""Overkill"", naming themselves after a [a233658] album.
Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

11606,334654,2849620,US,KMFDM,WTF?!,2011,50.57,11,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Industrial', 'Hard Rock']","Active since 1984, KMFDM are pioneers in the crossover between Techno/Dance/EBM electronics and heavy metal guitar samples. Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."
260864,107395,3572246,,Destruction,Inventor Of Evil,2005,50.55,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Thrash'],"Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Weil am Rhein (Germany). 

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

After the release of the demo ""Horror Infinity"" the band was signed to German Nuclear Blast Records where their first release was the debut album, ""Imperial Doom"". However, there where some disagreements with the label and eventually the band left the label. 

Two years after the release of the demo ""Slaves and Masters"", in 1994, the band was signed to Conquest Music and released their second album ""Millennium"" in 1996 (ironically licensed by Nuclear Blast for the European market). The album was a huge succes and the band then embarked on various tours to promote it. After the release and tours George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher left the band to become a member of Cannibal Corpse. He was replaced by Jason Avery. The band then returned to the studio to record their third album. The result was ""In Dark Purity"" which was released in 1999. 

In 2001 the band returned with the double disc album ""Enslaving The Masses"" which contained remixed songs from past albums (all vocals by George Fisher) on disc one and live songs from various shows on disc two. Unfortunately, Jason Avery had to leave the band because of personal reasons. He was replaced by Sam Molina. In 2002 former tour-only member Patrick Hall (guitar) re-joined the band as permanent member. 

In 2003 former vocalist Jason Avery also re-joined the band. Sam Molina didn't quit but instead he became second guitarist. Same year they recorded and released their fifth album, ""Rise To Power"", which was recorded at Audio Hammer studios in Sanford, Florida.

Ensiferum's black/death/folk metal hybrid was first born in 1995 when Markus Toivonen (guitar), Sauli Savolainen (bass) and Kimmo Miettinen (drums) got together to form an innovative band. The following year, Jari Mäenpää joined as a vocalist (and second guitarist) and the first self-titled demo was released. 

Before releasing their second demo tape in 1999, Jukka-Pekka Miettinen replaced Sauli Savolainen on bass and ex-Arthemesia drummer Oliver Fokin swapped positions with Kimmo Miettinen. The band continued playing and recorded a third demo, ""Hero in a Dream"", which was noticed by underground (and non) magazines which allowed the band to gain popularity and sign a deal with Spinefarm Records. 

Finally, Meiju Enho joined as keyboard player for the band and they were now able to record their epic, self-titled debut ""Ensiferum"" in 2001.

Graveland's style has changed from raw black metal on the early albums to a more epic sound which is inspired by Hammerheart-era Bathory. Lyrically, on the early works Rob Darken was inspired by Celtic beliefs, now he's Wotanism-orientated and calls his music ""epic pagan metal"". Several early releases and interviews with Rob Darken show antisemitic and pro-fascist tendencies.

One of the band logo was done by Christophe ""Volvox"" Szpajdel. This logo appears for the first time on ""Carpathian Wolves"" and was used up to ""Immortal Pride"", however it showed an inverted cross instead the thorshammer. This logo was replaced by a lettering in red Fraktur capitals during 1999 and 2003. Since ""Dawn of Iron Blades"", Graveland uses the shown logo.

All rereleases by No Colours Records after 2001 omit all lyrics in the booklets.

The song ""Spear of Wotan"" was included on the compilation The Night and Fog Vol. 3 which was released by Totenkopf Propaganda in 2007. A shorter version of ""Legion of Giants"" appears on ""No Colours Records Compilaton II"".

German BPjM (Federal Authority for Publications unsafe for the Youth) forbade the sale of 6 Graveland albums in Germany (namely: ""Following the Voice of Blood"", ""Immortal Pride"", ""In the Glare of Burning Churches"", ""The Celtic Winter"", ""Blood of Heroes"" and ""Dawn of Iron Blades"").

In May 2008, German police raided the office of No Colours Records and confiscated about 1500 banned Graveland CDs. After this, the rights to these Graveland's albums on No Colours Records were transferred to Forever Plagued Records.

Graveland played their first concert on 2 April 2016 in Milan, Italy. The second concert, and the first in their native country of Poland, took place on 22 April 2016 during Pomerania Fest vol. 1: Pagan Territory.

Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

The band has worked independently after their departure from Interscope Records, rarely playing live shows, but releasing their own albums on CD as well as online demos and purchasable songs.

Oranssi Pazuzu was formed in 2007 by [a2312967] (vocals, guitar), [a2312969] (drums), [a2312968] (bass guitar), [a2312970] (guitar) and [a2312966] (synthesizers, organ, effects). Oranssi (Orange) in the band's name refers to cosmic energy and the color of the first light rays in the Big Bang, while Pazuzu is a mythic demon of the wind, also appearing in the film The Exorcist.

During 2007-2008, Oranssi Pazuzu wrote songs using means of repetition and improvisation, fusing together various influences ranging from Black Metal to Space Rock. These early songs were recorded in Korjak's family cabin in the late summer of 2008 and released as the group's debut album Muukalainen puhuu by Violent Journey Records in April 2009.

In 2009-2010, Oranssi Pazuzu played shows around Finland and continued to write music that twisted itself towards darker and more aggressive moods. Sometime in early 2010, the band became friends with Marko Neuman (aka MN), a Finnish underground musician, who had an idea of a split album with Neuman's band Candy Cane. In September 2010, Oranssi Pazuzu played their first concerts outside Finland in Germany and the Netherlands. In November 2010, the Candy Cane / Oranssi Pazuzu split was released as a co-operation of two labels Firebox and Verdura Records.

Kosmonument, their second full-length album, was recorded in the old Karhu Manor in March 2011. MN acted as an artistic advisor, while Sami Jormanainen engineered the recordings and the mixing. The band described Kosmonument as a concept album that would summarize the musical ideas of cosmic darkness they had been developing ever since their debut album. In May 2011, Start Records released a vinyl version of Muukalainen puhuu and during the summer the band made a deal with Spinefarm Records regarding their future album. Kosmonument was released on 26th October 2011 as a CD by Spinefarm Records and as a double-lp by Blackspin Music.

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

The demo ""Suidakra Dawn"" was then released in 1995 and in 1997 the self-produced album, ""Lupine Essence"", was released. This lead to a deal with Last Episode. 

In 1998 the band recorded the second album, ""Auld Lang Syne"", and shortly after the release Zacharowski left the band and was replaced by Nils Broß. Several festivals followed and in 1999 the third album, ""Lays From Afar"", was recorded and released. The following year the fourth album, ""The Arcanum"", was released and Germano Sanna replaced Marcel Schoenen as he decided only to write lyrics. After a few live shows in 2001, F. T. replaced Nils and Marcel Schoenen also decided to participate on the next album. Dani and Möller left the band and one day later Lars Wehner (drums) was recruited.

94612,235005,2178695,US,The Album Leaf,A Chorus Of Storytellers,2010,50.05,11,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock', 'Folk, World, & Country']","['IDM', 'Indie Rock', 'Folk', 'Ambient']","THE ALBUM LEAF has been making its mark as a soft-spoken innovator steadily and surely since 1999. One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

259856,12573,2779618,Germany,Borknagar,Empiricism,2001,50.03,10,['Album'],['Rock'],['Viking Metal'],"Progressive metal band from Bergen, Norway.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Ocoai is a 5 piece instrumental band from East Tennessee, formed in the summer of 2006.

Their sound has been called everything from post rock & doom metal to Pink Floyd killing a dinosaur. Whatever the categories they've been put into, mainy they're a loud rock band that loves what they do & the bandmates they're doing it with. Having started as a 4 piece, losing an original member & gaining 2 new ones, Ocoai have a sound that has evolved over its six year life span.
Live, they incorporate guitars, drums, cello, & keys, while in the studio they've been known to include violin, synth, percussion, & many other noise making devices in their music. Whether performing in a club or creating in the studio, Ocoai is making music that they enjoy, regardless of the consequences or categorization. 
They have a debut album, released in 2008, entitled Breatherman. In the early spring of 2010 they released a split with other bands from around their East Tennessee home. It is called Peacecreature, and has music from Panzer, Dormia, and Generation of Vipers. Their most recent album, The Electric Hand was released in the spring of 2011.
Hopefully listeners will gather joy from what they do & spread both the feelings they experience & the music that stirred those emotions. That is what Ocoai is all about.

In 1994 Draugluin (guitar) joined the band and they soon began working on a demo. A lot of material was made but without a drummer it was tough doing it. But in 1995 their first demo ""Ved Ferdens Ende"" was recorded even though they still didn’t have a drummer. After the release Berserk left the band. They finally gained a drummer, Torvus, in 1996 and their second demo ""Possessed"" was recorded. After the release Torvus was kicked out and replaced by Desecrator. Also Diabolus Mort (guitar) came home to Norway after 4 years in the US and joined. 

In 1997 the EP ""Throne Of The Goat"" was recorded and released on Solistitium Records. A year later Nag was in the army and Diabous Mort and Desecrator lost interest in the band. Nag and Draugluin were once again alone, but continued writing material. They were joined by Blod (drums) of Gehenna and Arak Draconiiz (guitar) of Isvind. The promo ""Atum Nocturnem"" was released in 1999 by At War Records. After the promo Drakkar Productions and End All Life Productions got in touch with Tsjuder, and a deal for two albums and tours was signed. At the end of 1999 ""Kill For Satan"" was recorded and in 2000 it was released.

As the band was ready to go on their first tour Blod left because of time limits and was replaced by Anti Christian. After the release of ""Kill For Satan"" Arak Draconiiz moved away from Oslo, and was replaced by Paal. In 2001 Anti Christian had to leave the band because of tendinitis in both arms and Paal also left the band because of his work. Jontho (drums) of Ragnarok then joined the band and together they recorded ""Demonic Possession"" which was released in 2002.

Two of their three initial demo tracks were featured on [m52684], garnering international attention from fans and critics alike, and sparking their career as one of Projekt Records' most successful artists.

At first unsure what to term the unique sound of 'Idylls,' their premier album, many referred to the band as ethereal or darkwave. By their second release,'Ardor,' the band had embraced the newly emerged shoegaze movement. With 'Ever,' the third offering, the band stripped down their sound a bit, while at the same time exploring the beats and synth textures of trip-hop. Their last studio album, 'Flux,' culminated in a unique mix of jungle break beats and rhythms with their earlier ethereal, folk, and world elements. 'Temporal: A Collection of Music Past & Present,' a post-mortem compilation released in January 2000, illustrated how each successive Love Spirals Downwards album incorporated new elements into their basic foundation of atmospheric melodies and ethereal female vocals, while highlighting guest performances from lyricist/vocalists Kristen Perry and Jennifer Ryan Fuller and musicians Rodney Rodriguez, Doron Orenstein, and Jeff Stone.

The band's first two albums were also licensed to German label [l10347], who also featured several unique versions of album tracks on their popular 'Heavenly Voices' compilation series, as well as the [r520990] boxed set.

Primarily a recording project, the duo performed live about a dozen times -- generally in conjunction with Projekt Festivals -- almost all of them acoustically. Love Spirals Downwards' last live show was in 1998.

In 1999, Lum began working with a new collaborator, [a57399], under the shortened moniker of [a54422], initially releasing music on Projekt Records before launching the band's own label, Chillcuts. Over the years Lum has released additional material from Love Spirals Downwards on expanded and remastered versions of all 4 studio albums, plus the 'Sideways Forest,' single, as well as a collection of live recordings. Lovespirals have gone on to release 5 full length albums, a number of singles and EPs, plus numerous collaborations with other artists including Projekt Records founder [a145834], [a62520], [a25043], [a207570], [a14920], [a43420], and [a103011].

Perry founded the band [a285624] in 2002. In 2004 a Melodyguild recording was included on the Projekt Record compilation [r414718], followed by the 4 song EP [m1960582] in 2008. She has also released songs with [a25043] and [a546353], and performed live with [a2318670].

Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Coal Chamber are led by gruff vocalist Dez Fafara and operate in territory somewhere between the traditional hard riffing of Black Sabbath and the sensationalist techno rock of Marilyn Manson. Fafara met guitarist Miguel ""Meegs' Rascon through a classified ad, and they later added drummer Mike Cox and bass player Rayna Foss, the room-mate of Fafara's future wife.

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002. The band was further unsettled when Cox departed the same September. Coal Chamber split in 2003.

Forming in 1999 as Sw1tch, the band played shows around Ohio and released a demo entitled Fuckin' Demo. The songs ""Anymore"", ""Wrongside"", ""Inside"", ""Darkening Days"", ""Last Chance"", and ""Skins"", which appear in their demo versions on this CD, went on to appear on the Subject to Change album. This demo was later re-released on disc two of the ""Ghosts in the Machine"" album in 2006. Since a funk band already had rights to the name Switch, the band had to change their name to Sw1tched, and was later signed to Immortal/Virgin Records. After recording all of the bass for the Subject to Change album, bassist Shawn May left the band for unknown reasons, and was replaced by Chimaira drum tech Jason French. French did play bass on one song on the album, though, since the band re-recorded the song ""Walk Away"" before the album was released.

Switched rose to prominence playing at popular festivals such as Ozzfest in 2002 and on the Vans Warped Tour in 2001 and 2002. Their debut album titled, Subject to Change was released via Immortal/Virgin Records in 2002, and went on to sell over 100,000 records worldwide.

In mid-2003, the group severed ties with both their label Immortal Records and their former management team. Bassist Jason French was replaced by former [a=Stuck Mojo] and [a=Stereomud] bassist [a=Corey Lowery], who would eventually leave the band to join Dark New Day. During the recording phase for their second album, they had planned to adopt a new name, Sky Fall Down, by January 2004 – a reflection on the new direction the band was taking. Instead, the band went on a two-year hiatus, with several members of the band moving on to other projects.

Former bassist Shawn May, who had left the band in 2001 prior to the release of ""Subject to Change"", started a custom bass shop in Michigan. Drummer Chad Szeliga joined Leo in 2004 and then later joined popular post-grunge group Breaking Benjamin in 2005. Bassist Corey Lowery helped form alternative metal group Dark New Day, and later formed Eye Empire. Lead guitarist B.C. Kochmit joined then left hard rock group ""Rikets"" to form his own projects, called ""Tinjen"", ""Shambella"", and ""My Alter-Ego Experiment."" He was the lead guitar player in Dark New Day for a short time, and Eye Empire with Lowery and is currently a member Nonpoint. Vocalist [a=Ben Schigel] found success as a producer working with bands such as [a=Drowning Pool (2)], [a=Chimaira], [a=Breaking Benjamin], Rikets, [a302867] and Allele.

With help from their first manager, [a=Thom Hazaert], now co-president of Californian indie label, Corporate Punishment Records, the group reformed (with a modified lineup) and released their second album titled, Ghosts in the Machine on January 10, 2006. The two-disc album contains rarities, b-sides and demos. The first disc includes eleven tracks that were intended for the band's second Immortal release, while the second disc includes four live songs plus several demos and the unreleased track ""She Blinded Me with Science"". The quality of the first disc can be described as ""rough"" as the tracks weren't yet mastered and still in the demo phase.

A repackaged version of Subject to Change was also released which features the b-side track ""Spread"", the Howard Benson produced alternate versions of ""Walkaway"" and ""Inside"" and the Rick Will mix of ""Inside"". Two videos for ""Inside"" are also included.

Switched declared a second hiatus after Ghosts in the Machine but as of January 2010, according to [a=Ben Schigel], there are no plans to continue with Sw1tched.

Bassist Corey Lowery and guitarist B.C. Kochmit have since formed hard rock supergroup Eye Empire with solo artist Dixie Duncan and former members of Submersed singer Donald Carpenter and drummer Garrett Whitlock."

The band known for rejecting several names, which includes ""Virgin Killer"", this new band finally settled on ""Overkill"", naming themselves after a [a233658] album.
Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

Biography:
Pulse Ultra was initially formed as Head Space in 1997 by guitarist Dominic Cifarelli and bassist Jeff Feldman. Drummer Maxx Zinno was added that same year, followed by vocalist Zo Vizza two years later.

Pulse Ultra's break came in 2000 when the band met Taproot, with Cifarelli later passing on one of their demos to the band. Taproot guitarist Mike DeWolf, through their management team Velvet Hammer, later got the band signed with Atlantic Records.

After a year of songwriting, the band issued their debut album Headspace on July 16, 2002. The band would appear on the Ozzfest tour that year in support of the album's release. Subsequently, the album failed to push the band into the mainstream. In early 2004 the band went back to L.A. to work on the follow up to ""Headspace"". A few months into pre-production, Atlantic Records merged with AOL/TIME/WARNER. This resulted in Pulse Ultra being dropped due to minimal record sales.

At some point during mid-2004, tensions grew between the band and Zo, which soon after would lead Pulse Ultra to look for a new vocalist. In a post on the band's official forum, Zo stated that the split was amicable and they were all on good terms. Despite finding a replacement in Lukas Rossi, the band would disband shortly after. They are now all involved in other projects. Dominic Cifarelli (guitarist) released his debut solo project The Chronicles Of Israfel in 2007."

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

After traveling throughout Europe, he settled on the Greek island of Hydra, where he stayed for seven years.

Playing in local Chicago punk clubs, the group self-released their debut album, ""Mo' Money, Mo' 40'z"". The band got their first real break when front man Tony Lovato sent the band's album to Goldfinger's John Feldmann who helped them get signed to Maverick Records, and produced their major-label debut, ""Wasting Time"", which was released in July 2000. Since then the band has released three more albums on Maverick —2001's ""Destination Unknown"", 2003's self-titled disc, and 2005's ""Photographs""—and toured the world as part of the Warped Tour.
Tensions between the band members about the musical direction of the band, growing up, starting a family and not wanting to tour as much caused the band to break-up in 2006, and Mest announced their breakup, as well as a farewell tour entitled ""So Long and Thanx for the Booze"".
After spending some time off, Lovato was inspired to start writing music again. He joined up with new guitarist Mike Longworthand new drummer Lil Rich Gonzales. The end result was a series of pop-punk songs that paid tribute to Mest's past, but pushed the band forward into the future. They released a new album, ""Not What You Expected"". Lovato asked Tom Denney from A Day To Remember to co-write a song with him. The track is ""Radio (Something To Believe)"" and is an ode to all the bands that the duo grew up listening to. Jeremy, from A Day To Remember, jumped in the studio to record a part for the song."

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

The band known for rejecting several names, which includes ""Virgin Killer"", this new band finally settled on ""Overkill"", naming themselves after a [a233658] album.
Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

The band started out in 2003, self-releasing its debut album (Ludo) that summer on St. Louis vanity label Redbird Records. Over the next two years, Ludo began to make its mark on the music scene outside of St. Louis by touring constantly, playing the Winter X Games, appearing as part of the Warped Tour, and winning contests to play at Austin-based music festival South by Southwest (SXSW) and to have a video produced by Fuse.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

Not to be confused with Angel Dust (later Asmodina) from Darmstadt who released a demo in 1985.

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

Paths of Possession independently released their first CD-r demo, Legacy in Ashes, in 2000.

Following the release of Legacy of Ashes, Erin left the band to join Hell on Earth and was replaced by Brian Ridley (Cancerslug) in 2002. Soon after, Paths of Possession was approached by Keith ""Splattergod"" Suchland (Splattergod Records, Eviscerated Zombie Tampon) about releasing their next CD. It was mutually decided that they and Dark Faith would release a split EP, with each band contributing six songs.

While working on the split, Buttman was asked to join Withered Earth in late 2002, officially doing so in January 2003, resulting in the band going on hiatus and the split being put on hold. Following the release of Withered Earths' Of Which They Bleed, the band broke up and Buttman returned to Tampa and set about resurrecting the dormant Paths of Possession.

As their then vocalist, Bill, had relocated to New York, Buttman asked his friend, George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher (vocalist of Cannibal Corpse) to take over the vocal position. The new line-up then opted to record their six songs in Ozone Studios, St. Petersburg, Florida, finishing in September 2003. The result was entitled The Crypt of Madness and released on Splattergod Records, limited to 1000 copies. Plans were then made between the band and Splattergod to release their full length CD in late 2004 / early 2005.

Soon following the split's release, in early 2004, Richard Brunelle was replaced by current guitarist Jack Goodwin, and drummer Brian Ridley left to rejoin Cancerslug. Nick Goodyear (Dark Faith) stepped in to take over the drumming duties. Paths of Possession debuted their new/current lineup at the second Gathering of Lowlifes Festival on April 9 2005, appearing with the newly reformed Hallow's Eve as well as Dark Faith, Gardy Loo and Eviscerated Zombie Tampon.

It was also during this time that Metal Blade Records owner Brian Slagel, after hearing The Crypt of Madness, approached Fisher about signing Paths of Possession, which came about in 2005. Paths of Possession entered Mana Recording Studios / Razzor Media in St. Petersburg, Florida to record Promises in Blood, with renowned metal producer Erik Rutan. 

They followed this up with 2007's ""The End of the Hour"".

After the release of the demo ""Horror Infinity"" the band was signed to German Nuclear Blast Records where their first release was the debut album, ""Imperial Doom"". However, there where some disagreements with the label and eventually the band left the label. 

Two years after the release of the demo ""Slaves and Masters"", in 1994, the band was signed to Conquest Music and released their second album ""Millennium"" in 1996 (ironically licensed by Nuclear Blast for the European market). The album was a huge succes and the band then embarked on various tours to promote it. After the release and tours George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher left the band to become a member of Cannibal Corpse. He was replaced by Jason Avery. The band then returned to the studio to record their third album. The result was ""In Dark Purity"" which was released in 1999. 

In 2001 the band returned with the double disc album ""Enslaving The Masses"" which contained remixed songs from past albums (all vocals by George Fisher) on disc one and live songs from various shows on disc two. Unfortunately, Jason Avery had to leave the band because of personal reasons. He was replaced by Sam Molina. In 2002 former tour-only member Patrick Hall (guitar) re-joined the band as permanent member.

Following his departure from synth-metal band Spineshank in 2004, frontman Jonny Santos felt he wanted to move in a different direction musically and start from scratch. Silent Civilian was thus formed and the band faced trouble from the start after experiencing several line-up changes and departing from their original record label Corporate Punishment Records.

The band signed with Mediaskare Records and released their debut record, Rebirth of the Temple, on May 2, 2006. Receiving generally positive reviews, the album has sold more than 25,000 copies since its release in the United States. The band continues to tour supporting the record as Santos one day wants to establish the band as a headlining act. Their line-up consists of Santos (vocals and guitar), Rudy ""Fyto"" Perez (guitar) and Stan Derby (bass). Drummer Chris Mora left the band in late December 2007 due to ""personal reasons"".
Jonny Santos, who is best known as the vocalist and song writer for the Grammy Award nominated synth-metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt it was time to move on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.[1]

Realizing he wanted to start a band from scratch, Santos placed an ad for a drummer on the social networking website MySpace. After receiving a large number of e-mails, Santos received an e-mail from Chris Mora with a video of him drumming. Santos thought ""You can’t be for real, dude"" and asked Mora to come down for the first audition. 10 minutes into the audition Mora was hired as the drummer. Santos auditioned for an Australian band that moved to America called Cryogenic. Although he thought the band was not for him, he met the band's bassist Henno. As Cryogenic and Mudrock, who were working together, had both lost their vocalists, Henno contacted Santos and asked him to join the band, to which Santos accepted. Ryan Ready, who Santos had known since high-school, was recruited as the second guitarist. The band's original name was announced as Silent Civilians, which originates from the world's climate change by that people have opinions on life and politics and they do not voice their beliefs, living in a nation full of 'silent civilians'.[1]


Label and line-up changes
Silent Civilians signed to Corporate Punishment Records in January, 2005 and began work on their debut album, Rebirth of the Temple. However, in May Santos announced they left CPR for reasons he was unable to discuss. The band began talking to several labels after this and pushed the release of their debut to late 2005 or early 2006. The album was recorded at Undercity Recordings, with production duties handled by former Machine Head and Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader, and co-production handled by his partner, Lucas Banker. The band also announced they had changed their name to Silent Civilian.[2] In June, guitarist Ryan Ready left the band due to personal reasons, not relating to the band. Santos sought a replacement, and the following day to Ready's departure set up auditions. Tim Mankowski, who Santos had known for 15 years and played in the band Basic Enigma with him, was hired as the new guitarist.[2]

In November 2005, the band signed with Mediaskare records and planned a tentative release for their debut album for February 21, 2006. At this time, the band had three demo versions of the songs ""Lies in the House of Shame"", ""Divided"" and the title track, ""Rebirth of the Temple"".[3] Mora and Santos were involved in the writing process of the album. While Mora was at work, Santos was at home writing riffs and would create roughly three to four 'skeletons of songs' a week. When Mora finished work, he would help Santos with arrangements, the body of the song, and track it that night and record the vocals and melodies the following day. 30 songs were primarily written for the album as Santos wanted fans to get their moneys worth. 16 songs were recorded that included two cover versions of the thrash metal band Slayer's ""War Ensemble” and Death Angel's ""Seemingly Endless Time"". Although neither cover songs made it onto the album. The length of the CD is 64 minutes, which features the video of the album's title track, and an exclusive 10 minute documentary on the creation process of the album.[4]

Rebirth of the Temple
Silent Civilian released their debut album Rebirth of the Temple on May 2, 2006. Blabbermouth.net reviewer, Scott Alisoglu, thought ""on virtually every track, the group meshes attacking riffs, searing solos, brutal drumming, and melody-drenched bombast"". Although he did not believe it was a 'grand slam', he thought it was a ""pleasant surprise and strong first effort"".[5] Charlie Steffens of KNAC described the album as ""goddamn electric"",[6] while Greg Maki of live-metal.net awarded the album a perfect 10 out of 10 selecting it as his ""best album I have heard so far in 2006.""[7] As of June 5, 2007, Rebirth of the Temple has sold 25,000 copies.[8]

The video for the first single, ""Rebirth of the Temple"", was directed by Scott Culver and was filmed at Santos' childhood home. Santos invited 50 friends over for a party and posted a bulletin that read ""If you’re in the L.A. area, if you’re a Silent Civilian fan, show up at this address"" two hours before filming. This resulted in another 30 people turning up. Static-X front-man Wayne Static, Stone Sour drummer Roy Mayorga and Logan make appearances in the video.[1]

Tim Mankowski departed the band and Henno broke his ankle on an on-stage mishap. The band continued to tour as a three-piece as they sought for a replacement guitarist and bassist as soon as possible — Henno was able to perform on a bar stool temporarily. While touring with Nothingface Santos had met guitarist Marcus Rafferty, who he became friends with and recruited him to replace Mankowski after an audition. Touring partners Bleed the Sky assisted in replacing members for live shows. Bassist Disco Daylen took to the stage replacing Henno and guitarist Kyle Moorman assisted with the replacement of the guitarist by playing half the set and Rafferty would play the other. Santos asked Rafferty if he knew any bass players who were interested in a position, he contacted a friend of his, Stan Derby, who replaced Disco after one month.[4]

In a July 2006 interview with Live-Metal.net, Santos stated the band was planning on recording a tribute EP of cover versions on old Bay Area music, including such bands as Sacred Reich, Death Angel, Exodus and Testament. The band is touring on The Sweet Revenge Tour with Kittie, It Dies Today and Bring Me The Horizon and by the end of the year Santos hopes to establish the band as a headlining act.[4] On December 28, 2007 in a statement released to Blabbermouth.net, Mora explained his departure from the band was based on personal reasons.[9]

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

The band has taken a long road to its way to succeed: after releasing 3 records and touring around in Hungary for many years, Ektomorf took the chance to go international, bringing their heavy grooves and harsh lyrics for all the people around the globe. The mix of groove, thrash, hardcore and traditional gipsy music got recognized by many, and success was provided by their legendary energetic and destructive stage performances – wich made Ektomorf not only the most famous hungarian metal-act, but also one of the leading artist in their genre. Signed by Nuclear Blast, producing their hit albums like ’Destroy’, ’Instinct’ and ’Outcast’ it was proven that Ektomorf can’t go wrong with their powerful, groovy style, and kept on walking the same line while adding more melodies and traditional accoustic elements, proving their critics that there’s a next level to elevate to. After changing record label and getting signed by AFM Records the band released their 2010 recording ’Redemption’, wich was another relentless manifestation of the monster what’s being feeded by anger, hate and social criticism, with a touch of human soul.

As part of their passion project, and searching for something unusual, they've produced one of the most interresting record, wich showed a rarely known side of the band – ’The Accoustic’ presented a suprise for the fans of groove metal by being an experimental album consisting covers, new and old songs written and re-recorded „unplugged”.

		

This step has helped the quartett to reach out to their non-traditional fanbase - with a couple of exclusive accoustic shows and radio performances the Ektomorf was again in the spotlight. Taken from that album, the video of ’To Smoulder’ took a rise being played daily in mainstream media.

Later that year Ektomorf released their new album, wich follows the traditional way for the band – but still some new elements reaching surface on it. ’Black Flag’ offers 50 minutes of massive grooves, unforgetable melodies, and new, even more sophisticated sound – courtesy of Tue Madsen, Ektomorf’s long time producer and friend, who travelled to Hungary in a sake for recording yet another masterpiece in the band’s home studio.

In January 2014 the band will release their new studio album, titled as ‘RETRIBUTION’. Again, with producer Tue Madsen the hungarian groove-metal beast continues to impress with its huge sound and intense, powerful songs, wich many of the press already labeled as their best album so far. 14 tracks of brutal honest songs, presumably many of them will be huge hits on any dancefloor or live event!

Earthshaking grooves with a critical, energetic message – Ektomorf will break down all the walls and unite people on the dancefloor around the world, from the smallest clubs to the biggest festivals.

Indukti was created at the end of 1999. Its core was formed of musicians who had been part of Vain, a band which received several awards at various young talents festivals. The music that they decided to play was a cross of various musical  interests of all members of the band but it was frequently compared to King Crimson, Tool and Anekdoten. From the very beginning, Indukti was an instrumental band, although they have had a period when they were searching for a vocalist. The lack of proper candidate, did not stop them from being successful.
In 2003, they received Grand Prix during the first edition of BIG STAR FESTIVAL. A year later, their debut album entitled S.U.S.A.R. (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) was released which, to a large extent, was inspired by Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. During the making of the album, the band cooperated with vocalist Mariusz Duda and harpist Anna Faber.
In 2005, thanks to Laser’s Edge label, the album made its way to the shops all over the world. In the same year, the band received the journalists’ award during UNION OF ROCK festival. 2 years later, the band participated in Mexican BAJA PROG and American NEARFest festivals.
In 2009, thanks to German InsideOut Music, a second album of the group entitled “Idmen” was released. Its content is an allegory of human struggle with destiny, faith, everyday life, nature and himslef. The title of the album was taken from Homer’s Odyssey. The album is featuring singers Nils Frykdahl (Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Faun Fables, Idiot Flesh), Maciej Taff (Rootwater, Black River) i Michael Luginbuehl (Prisma) and musicians Marta Maślanka (dulcimer) and Robert Majewski (trumpet)."

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

Not to be confused with Angel Dust (later Asmodina) from Darmstadt who released a demo in 1985.

[a266100] was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release."

The recording of Jesus, Jesus ver du hjå meg appeared on a Norwegian compilation album in 1993. 
The song was also featured on the first demo tape of Antestor which was released in 1994.
The Norwegian unblack metal band is credited for starting the northern European Christian black metal scene. 
Antestor is the only Christian band to have an album released by Cacophonous Records, which has also released records by bands such as Dimmu Borgir, Sigh, and Cradle of Filth. 
The band's only release on Cacophonous, The Return of the Black Death (later rereleased as Kongsblod), proved influential for the Christian black metal movement, and has sold over 10,000 copies.

In the late 1990s they dubbed their musical style as ""sorrow metal"" rather than black metal because the black metal movement was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. 

The group has gone through several line-up changes over the years, and currently Antestor consists of the founding guitarist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist Ronny Hanielsen (Hansen) (Vrede), bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen, guitarist Robert Bordevick, and drummer Henning Børven. The original vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr), guitarist Erling Jørgensen (Pilgrim) and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth) left the band around 2000, Vegard Undal (Gard) left the band in 2005. The reputable Norwegian extreme metal drummer Jan Axel Blomberg (Hellhammer) played session drums for their 2005 album The Forsaken and Det tapte liv EP.

Evolving from Cleveland's Teutonic protopunks, [a252899], Pere Ubu was formed late in 1975 by Thomas (aka Crocus Behemoth) and guitarist Peter Laughner (who died in 1977). Ubu's classic early singles, ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""Final Solution,"" oozed restless angst way before it became the domain of spoiled mallrats. By 1978's aggressive The Modern Dance and the wilder Dub Housing, Pere Ubu's subversions of rock were guided by superior musicianship and fallout from Thomas's Jehovah's Witness upbringing. Personality quirks split the band, and Thomas regrouped for three more self-indulgent albums through 1982, including the abstract stare-down of The Art Of Walking, all with some difficult sonic perversion to recommend them.

After several Ubus found themselves onstage in Thomas's Wooden Birds, the band was revived for 1988's The Tenement Year. With newfound focus, Pere Ubu unleashed the ravishing funhouse pop experiment of 1989's Cloudland, which treated mainstream textures like found sounds. The sparkling pop, dented by Thomas's unique warble, continued with the gently peculiar Worlds In Collision. But Ubu tired of the total pop concept and returned to quirkier pursuits for Story Of My Life. Tim Kerr Records picked up the ball with 1995's full-bodied Ray Gun Suitcase--a mix of Ubu's vicious rock, luscious pop and art-damaged identities--and a series of multimedia-enhanced EPs, for which Thomas programmed the codes."

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

The group's title is an acronym for ""We Are Sexual Perverts"" as shown in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/WASP-WASP/release/1301774]first press vinyl's runout of their debut album[/url].

The band is led by vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Blackie Lawless. They arose out of Los Angeles's glam metal scene and gained notoriety for their over the top stage shows, which included the band throwing raw meat into the audience, scantily clad women on stage, and Lawless's spark-shooting codpiece.  

The group's first single, ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" brought further infamy.  

The band was commercially successful throughout most of the 1980's but also caught the attention of parent's groups, most significantly the PMRC.  Lawless continues to record and tour under the W.A.S.P. banner with various line ups. 

In the 2000s, he reclaimed the Christian faith of his youth and subsequently began toning down his stage shows and censoring some of the lyrics to some of his older, more explicit songs during live performances.  

He has also publicly stated that he will no longer play ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" due to his religious faith."

The band has taken a long road to its way to succeed: after releasing 3 records and touring around in Hungary for many years, Ektomorf took the chance to go international, bringing their heavy grooves and harsh lyrics for all the people around the globe. The mix of groove, thrash, hardcore and traditional gipsy music got recognized by many, and success was provided by their legendary energetic and destructive stage performances – wich made Ektomorf not only the most famous hungarian metal-act, but also one of the leading artist in their genre. Signed by Nuclear Blast, producing their hit albums like ’Destroy’, ’Instinct’ and ’Outcast’ it was proven that Ektomorf can’t go wrong with their powerful, groovy style, and kept on walking the same line while adding more melodies and traditional accoustic elements, proving their critics that there’s a next level to elevate to. After changing record label and getting signed by AFM Records the band released their 2010 recording ’Redemption’, wich was another relentless manifestation of the monster what’s being feeded by anger, hate and social criticism, with a touch of human soul.

As part of their passion project, and searching for something unusual, they've produced one of the most interresting record, wich showed a rarely known side of the band – ’The Accoustic’ presented a suprise for the fans of groove metal by being an experimental album consisting covers, new and old songs written and re-recorded „unplugged”.

		

This step has helped the quartett to reach out to their non-traditional fanbase - with a couple of exclusive accoustic shows and radio performances the Ektomorf was again in the spotlight. Taken from that album, the video of ’To Smoulder’ took a rise being played daily in mainstream media.

Later that year Ektomorf released their new album, wich follows the traditional way for the band – but still some new elements reaching surface on it. ’Black Flag’ offers 50 minutes of massive grooves, unforgetable melodies, and new, even more sophisticated sound – courtesy of Tue Madsen, Ektomorf’s long time producer and friend, who travelled to Hungary in a sake for recording yet another masterpiece in the band’s home studio.

In January 2014 the band will release their new studio album, titled as ‘RETRIBUTION’. Again, with producer Tue Madsen the hungarian groove-metal beast continues to impress with its huge sound and intense, powerful songs, wich many of the press already labeled as their best album so far. 14 tracks of brutal honest songs, presumably many of them will be huge hits on any dancefloor or live event!

Earthshaking grooves with a critical, energetic message – Ektomorf will break down all the walls and unite people on the dancefloor around the world, from the smallest clubs to the biggest festivals.

Gustafson left before the recording of their first LP, Grimaldi was replaced by Jason Viebrooks, and the band went on to record two albums of groove-thrash metal in the early Machine Head vein with that line-up.
After the second album ""Nemesis"" was released in 1997, Viebrooks also left, and was replaced by Canadian bassist Stuart Carruthers for the recording of their third album ""Solidify"" (1999), before more or less naturally dissolving since the members were involved in other activities.

At this point, Lombardo is concentrating on the Fantomas project, and Sorychta has been busy producing bands like Tiamat, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering. 

The band never really disappeared though, and in 2004 they released a new album called ""Incorporated"" with Sorychta filling in on bass duties.

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"".

Formed in 1998, the band released one full-length studio album in 2003 and disbanded in 2005 after their guitarist, Andrew Howard, was found dead. Twisted Method was founded in 1998 after its band members met each other at Mariner High School. The band signed a five-year, $5.5 million contract with MCA Records in 2002, the label issuing the band's debut album 'Escape from Cape Coma' in July of the following year, the title a sarcastic reference to their home town.

Band members described their home town as a place where ""old people retire"" such that ""it's like the walking dead"". Geffen Records, who had recently been acquired by MCA Records, bought the band a spot on the second stage of the 2003 Ozzfest tour. Despite being in contract limbo for quite a while, things were looking up when Geffen indicated they would finance a second album, even putting them on tour with Dope twice in 2004 and recording demos in June with Edsel Dope. They toured with Dope and Motograter in 2004 as part of the American Apathy tour.

In July 2005, Twisted Method went on an ""indefinite hiatus"" after guitarist Andrew Howard and drummer Ben Goins had quit the band. Howard left because he wanted to be with his family after becoming a father, and Goins ""left the band for God"".

Andrew Howard was found dead on Friday afternoon of September 16, 2005. He was only 23 years old. Over four years after his passing, his death still remains unsolved. Remaining Twisted Method members, Derrick Tribbett and Derek DeSantis formed a new metal group named MakeShift Romeo.

Aside from Makeshift Romeo, vocalist Derrick ""Tripp"" Tribbett is filling in on bass for Dope, and bassist Derek DeSantis has joined the band EkoTren, who is currently on tour with Ill Nino. Tribbett also recorded solo material under the name Sinister and collaborated with John Rich."

The band used to be a Christian band but no longer associates with the Christian music scene and thinks Religion and Music should stay separate. This change was made because while for most of the bands' career all the members were Christian, by the time they split in 2013 they had some non-Christian members. These members felt alienated and it caused lots of issues within the band, so the band made the choice to keep their beliefs to themself and just be a non-Christian rock band.

Group's original line-up was completed in 1998 by Skrymer, Tundra, Trollhorn and Beast Dominator and their debut album ""Midnattens widunder"" was released in 1999. Altogether they have released six full lengths, the last one being 2013's ""Blodsvept"".

Despite being a Finnish band, Finntroll chose to write their lyrics in Swedish due to their original vocalist Katla being Fenno-Swedish.

In March 2003 Finntroll was struck by the tragic death of the guitarist Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta.

(Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.) The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years.

The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.

Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers. Another noteworthy aspect of W&C's sound is the absence of drums.

Formed by guitarist Kirk Hammett & drummer Tom Hunting (who initially handled vocals as well). The group was rounded out by guitarist Tim Agnello and bassist Carlton Melson. The line up shifted several times in the early years.

1982 - 1985

In 1982, Exodus included Kirk Hammett and Gary Holt on guitars, Paul Baloff on lead vocals, Geoff Andrews on bass and drummer Tom Hunting. This lineup recorded the band's 1982 demo.

In 1983, founding member Kirk Hammett left Exodus to join Metallica and was replaced by guitarist Rick Hunolt and Rob McKillop replaced Andrews on bass. This line-up recorded and released their debut album, ""Bonded by Blood"" in 1984 (released in 1985).

1986 - 1991

Shortly before the recording of ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" in 1987, Paul Baloff was replaced by Steve ""Zetro"" Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for the San Francisco band Legacy (later known as Testament). Baloff later went on to form the band [a=Piranha (9)].

In 1989, the band released ""Fabulous Disaster"" which garnered good press and, eventually, a major label deal.  That same year, Tom Hunting departed, leaving the group with no founding members.  In 1991 the band released their first live effort, ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", which featured new bassist Mike Butler.

1991 - 1998

After the release of ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", the band toured sporadically for a year and released another studio album, ""Force of Habit"". This album was a departure for the band, containing several slower, ""heavier"" songs with less emphasis on the speed/thrash basis of their older material.  Unable to match the commercial success of some of their peers and dealing with internal stresses and problems, Exodus split in 1994.

After a few dormant years, Exodus released only another live album in 1997 titled ""Another Lesson in Violence"" and featuring the return of vocalist Paul Baloff and new bassist Jack Gibson. Exodus disintegrated again, partly due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

2001 - 2004

In 2001, Exodus reformed again, initially to play the Chuck Billy benefit, the ""Thrash of the Titans"" mega concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local gigs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. In February 2002, Paul Baloff suffered a seizure/stroke from which he eventually died. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments.

Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004's ""Tempo of the Damned"" released on Nuclear Blast.

2005 - Present

In 2005, Hunolt decided to leave the band to concentrate on his family life. He was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also left, citing strong personal objections over some of Holt's anti-Christian lyrics as well as anxiety issues. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph who had previously played with Forbidden, Slayer and Testament.  Souza also left under disputed terms in 2005. 
He was replaced intitially by Steev Esquivel (ex-Defiance and Skinlab) and then later by Rob Dukes whose first recorded performance for the band is 2005's ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine"". 

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007.  In 2012, Rick Hunolt returned in a guest role, filling in for Gary Holt on several live dates while Holt toured with [a=Slayer].  In 2014, Steve Souza returned to the group. He departed again in January 2025, with Rob Dukes returning as vocalist.

After losing not one, but 2 frontmen and a touring frontman within 5 years, most bands would have called it quits. But not these guys, oh no. They recruited French singer Guillaume Bideau and together they took the band to new heights, releasing the critically heralded album ‘Passenger’ in early 2007.

Relentless touring and hard work got them to the point of a well-respected metal band, but their big break came when they got a chance to open for the mighty Metallica. They played their hearts out during this gig in Denmark and pleased the gods of heavy so much that they were asked to open on a leg of Metallica’s European summer tour. This was a dream chance for any band, but for mnemic it was the chance to show Europe just what a force of heavy metal awesomeness they really are.

68259,113847,657550,US,Tristeza,Spine and Sensory,1999,45.48,10,['Album'],['Rock'],['Post Rock'],"The group formed in San Diego, California during the Spring months of 1997, playing their first gig as Tristeza (Christopher Sprague-guitar, James LaValle-guitar, Luis Hermosillo-bass, and James Lehner-drums) in September of that year. Stephen Swesey joined as keyboardist shortly after, and they recorded the Foreshadow 7"" with Gar Wood at his garage in December. The single was released the following spring.

In 1998, Tristeza toured the U.S. extensively in support of the 7"", while fine-tuning songs for the recording of their first LP. In the Autumn of 1998, ""Spine and Sensory"" was recorded by Tim Green at his Louder Studios in San Francisco. Makoto Recordings released the album in April of 1999, while the band toured in its support. Also released in 1999, were the ""Insound Tour-support Series Vol. 1"" EP-CD and the ""Macrame 7"". Both were recorded with Mike Hammel at his Last Time Around Studio in Los Angeles. These releases were limited and sold out during tour.

In April of 2000, the group took two weeks off, mid-tour, to record their second full-length album ""Dream Signals in Full Circles"" with producer Dave Trumfio at his King Size Sound Labs, in Chicago. Tiger Style Records released the album in September of that year, and again, the group toured for the remainder of the year promoting it. ""Dream Signals..."" was well received around the world, and in the early months of 2001, Tristeza headlined tours in Europe and Japan for the first time.

After the ""Dream Signals..."" tours, the group took time off from performing to record some experimental material with Matt Anderson for release on his Gravity label. The ""Mania Phase"" 12"" and the ""Mixed Signals"" remixes collection were released early in 2002. Tristeza toured the U.S., Japan, and Europe, once again, for the promotion of these releases. Prior to these tours, Stephen Swesey left the band, and was replaced by tour keyboardist Eric Hinojosa.

At the beginning of 2003, James LaValle played his last gig with the group in order to focus on his Album Leaf project full-time. The group took time off from performing live, and James Lehner moved back to Michigan for a while. Peace and solitude was necessary for Lehner as he preparred for and adjusted to fatherhood. A good amount of time was also needed for the other members to rest and regroup while searching for 2 new members. The band chose to release another 12"" on Gravity. ""Espuma"" features songs previously unreleased, live material, and the first song recorded without LaValle entitled ""This Trap"". The last two months of the year were spent rehearsing with the assistance of friend Mitch Wilson on guitar, and demo versions of 4 songs were recorded with Pall Jenkins at his home studio.

In 2004, Tristeza began writing and rehearsing a second batch of songs for the new album with Keyboardist Sean Ogilvie. His musical background and training made him a perfect fit in the band. The new songs were very complex arrangements with odd time signatures, consequently Mitch recommended his good friend Alison Ables as a potential guitarist. Also an old friend of the group, Alison had no trouble whatsoever learning the new songs, and finally, mid-way through the year, Tristeza had its new line up.

The band has gone through countless line-ups and many former members have gone on to become significant figures in a variety of musical scenes.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles. This line-up lasted until 2004, when Jesse Pintado left the band. Currently the band consists of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and Danny Herrera.

Paths of Possession independently released their first CD-r demo, Legacy in Ashes, in 2000.

Following the release of Legacy of Ashes, Erin left the band to join Hell on Earth and was replaced by Brian Ridley (Cancerslug) in 2002. Soon after, Paths of Possession was approached by Keith ""Splattergod"" Suchland (Splattergod Records, Eviscerated Zombie Tampon) about releasing their next CD. It was mutually decided that they and Dark Faith would release a split EP, with each band contributing six songs.

While working on the split, Buttman was asked to join Withered Earth in late 2002, officially doing so in January 2003, resulting in the band going on hiatus and the split being put on hold. Following the release of Withered Earths' Of Which They Bleed, the band broke up and Buttman returned to Tampa and set about resurrecting the dormant Paths of Possession.

As their then vocalist, Bill, had relocated to New York, Buttman asked his friend, George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher (vocalist of Cannibal Corpse) to take over the vocal position. The new line-up then opted to record their six songs in Ozone Studios, St. Petersburg, Florida, finishing in September 2003. The result was entitled The Crypt of Madness and released on Splattergod Records, limited to 1000 copies. Plans were then made between the band and Splattergod to release their full length CD in late 2004 / early 2005.

Soon following the split's release, in early 2004, Richard Brunelle was replaced by current guitarist Jack Goodwin, and drummer Brian Ridley left to rejoin Cancerslug. Nick Goodyear (Dark Faith) stepped in to take over the drumming duties. Paths of Possession debuted their new/current lineup at the second Gathering of Lowlifes Festival on April 9 2005, appearing with the newly reformed Hallow's Eve as well as Dark Faith, Gardy Loo and Eviscerated Zombie Tampon.

It was also during this time that Metal Blade Records owner Brian Slagel, after hearing The Crypt of Madness, approached Fisher about signing Paths of Possession, which came about in 2005. Paths of Possession entered Mana Recording Studios / Razzor Media in St. Petersburg, Florida to record Promises in Blood, with renowned metal producer Erik Rutan. 

They followed this up with 2007's ""The End of the Hour"".

In December 1997 the band was put on a permanent halt as Nödtveidt was arrested for killing a man earlier that year. He was later sentenced to 10 years in prison for assistance to murder and illegal possession of a firearm.

In 2003 Nödtveidt announced the comeback of Dissection and the renewed band eventually returned to the stage on October 30th, 2004 at the Arenan in Stockholm. Soon after the release of their third album “Reinkaos” on April 30th, 2006, Nödveidt announced the end of Dissection as he “had reached the limitations of music as a tool for expression and with Reinkaos they had managed to manifest a truly Satanic record and the work of Dissection had been done. Now it was time to move on to other realms of practice.” Their final concert was performed on June 24th, 2006 at Hovet, Stockholm. About two months later, on August 13th, 2006, Jon Nödtveidt committed suicide.

Music-wise, Dissection combined various styles of extreme metal with a strong melodic sensibility and a sinister/melancholic atmosphere. Despite often being considered death/black metal, the band themselves refused such categorization and typically referred to their music as Metal of Death, or Anti Cosmic Metal of Death.

The same night they were formed they also recorded their first demo, ""The Art of Dying"". It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

Finntroll was established in 1997 by Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta (guitar) and Jan ""Katla"" Jämsen (vocals) who had the vision of fusing the darkness and grandeur of black metal with the traditional Finnish hoedown-music. Group's original line-up was completed in 1998 by Skrymer, Tundra, Trollhorn and Beast Dominator and their debut album ""Midnattens widunder"" was released in 1999. Altogether they have released six full lengths, the last one being 2013's ""Blodsvept"".

Despite being a Finnish band, Finntroll chose to write their lyrics in Swedish due to their original vocalist Katla being Fenno-Swedish.

In March 2003 Finntroll was struck by the tragic death of the guitarist Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta.

They were active from 2001 to 2003 before breaking up, releasing two albums.

History
Stereomud released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. 
After extensive touring in support of that album, they went back into the studio, releasing Every Given Moment in April 2003. 

After participating in the Jagermeister Music Tour with P.E., Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, a mere 3 months after the release of Every Given Moment. 

They have performed a few select reunion shows since this, but for the most part, the band remains dormant to this day. Recently, it was rumored that Erik Rogers and Corey Lowery would reunite to reform the band, but the possibilities may not be true as they are focusing on their own bands. 

It is planned that a Stereomud DVD will be released at some point in the future. Erik Rogers changed band name to 'Dangerous New Machine' with a new lineup February 2009.

Band members:
    * Erik Rogers - vocalist (subsequently in Soundevice, Love Said No and Dangerous New Machine, currently in My Therapy)
    * Corey Lowery - bassist (previously of Stuck Mojo and Switched, currently in Dark New Day)
    * Dan Richardson - drummer (previously of Crumbsuckers and Pro-Pain and Life of Agony)
    * John Fattoruso - guitarist ( Now in Black Water Rising )

Founded in 1993 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched. Same year recorded the MCD called ""Ex Inferis"" at the Ballerina Studio. It contained a new studio track, a cover and three previously released tracks. 

In 2003 they released ""Sheol"" which gained them major success.

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

They changed their name to The Matches in 2002 and released 3 studio albums before going on hiatus in 2009. They have reunited every few years since, celebrating the 10-year anniversaries of each of their albums with performances and deluxe vinyl reissues.

The Locals were formed by high school students [a=Matt Esposito] (lead guitar, backing vocals), Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals), Matt Whalen (drums, percussion), and Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar). [a=Miles Hurwitz] became their manager in 2000 and played a major role in guiding their career, including acting as co-writer and producer. Esposito left after graduating and was replaced by Jon Devoto. As The Locals, the band released a 6-song demo and 3-song EP, and built up a following in the East Bay. In 2002, threatened with a copyright infringement lawsuit by [a=Yvonne Doll And The Locals], they changed their name to The Matches.

The Matches recorded and self-released their first album, [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] (2003). They signed to Epitaph Records, who re-mixed and re-released it the following year. Their second album, [i]Decomposer[/i] (2006) took their music in a more idiosyncratic direction with contributions from nine different record producers. It reached no. 18 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. Extensive worldwide touring followed over the next two years. Their third album, [i]A Band In Hope[/i], was released in March 2008 and found them shifting further away from pop-punk. It reached no. 179 on the [i]Billboard[/i] 200. San Souci left the band that July and was replaced by Dylan Rowe.

The Matches announced a hiatus in July 2009. Shortly thereafter, they self-released the digital album [i]The Matches Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title?

The following year they re-released [i]Decomposer[/i], also as a deluxe 2-LP set, and again played a series of shows resulting in a digital live album, [i]Recomposer[/i].

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles. This line-up lasted until 2004, when Jesse Pintado left the band. Currently the band consists of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and Danny Herrera.

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

Also of note was guitarist [a=Ian Williams]' guitar-playing, which relied heavily on a finger-tapping approach used for the rhythm playing (there are no solos in Don Caballero's music) and heavy use of a delay pedal.  Despite an appearance to the contrary, the group's songs are not improvised jams but are structured works.

The group split in 2001 following van accident while on tour, although increasing tension within the band, particularly between Che and Williams, contributed heavily to the break-up.

After the split, members wandered off into different groups.  In 2003, Che decided to revive the Don Caballero name.  Although he invited both Mike Banfield and Pat Morris back into the group, he vowed never to work with Ian Williams again.  Banfield and Morris both declined, and Che instead regrouped with members of Creta Bourzia, also from Pittsburgh.

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

In 1990 the band recorded a demo, ""Reincremation"" and an EP, ""Human Waste"" in 1991. That same year they released their first full-length, ""Effigy Of The Forgotten"". After the release Josh Barohn was replaced by Chris Richards. 
In 1993 they released ""Breeding the Spawn"" which turned out to have a poor production. Mike Smith also left the band after this release and was replaced by Doug Bohn. With a new drummer they released ""Pierced From Within"" in 1995. On tour, Frank Mullen was replaced by Keith DeVito. Doug Bohn eventually also left the band and was replaced by Dave Culross. 
In 1998 they released the EP ""Depise the Sun"". That same EP was apparently the band's last record as they broke up shortly after. 
However, in 2002, the band was resurrected by Frank Mullen, Terrance Hobbs, Derek Boyer, Guy Marchais and Mike Smith. They began playing live shows and in 2004 they released ""Souls to Deny"".

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

Then called Downside, the quartet -- vocalist Eric Victorino, guitarist Ryan Hernandez, bassist Hrag Chanchanian, and drummer Adrian Robison -- started playing out frequently, and by 2001 had self-released an LP. An Internet release followed. Tours with homeboys like Alien Ant Farm and Dredg raised Strata's stock, and though numerous labels showed interest in their post-grunge grooves (similar to types like Trapt or even Hoobastank), the band eventually signed with mondo-successful startup Wind-Up. 

Their largely self-produced, eponymously titled debut appeared in July 2004. Presents the End of the World followed three years later. The trio spent the next two years writing songs while touring the U.S. and U.K., then returned to hit the studio and record Strata Presents the End of the World, released in July 2007. 

In 2008, after Victorino announced he had left the band, Strata called it a day. Victorino went on to form the electronic-pop duo the Limousines while Hernandez and Robison formed the group Beta State.

In 2014, the band reunited, minus Adrian Robison on drums, replaced by long time friend of the band Andy Bailey who played with the band until 2019 after which the drums were played by Jim Leadbetter. In 2017 Jonathan Poso joined the band on piano and synthesizer.

Since reuniting, the band released a new six-song EP called 'The Sawmill Sessions' on March 8, 2016, a 10 year anniversary edition of 'Strata Presents The End Of The World' in 2017, and have started releasing new music through bandcamp as of 2020.

They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"".

The latter were transformed entirely when [a10360] from [a10343] met up with them, and formed Ash Ra Tempel. 

The trio of Göttsching / Enke / Schulze decided to abandon conventional composition and songwriting in favour of free-form improvising and developing a new musical language. As such, they became notorious for jams that could exceed 30 minutes (some such recordings can be found on [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1406291-The-Private-Tapes]The Private Tapes[/url] releases). Ash Ra Tempel went to Hamburg in March 1971 to record their debut, with the aid of top engineer [a40135]. A Krautrock twist on the space-rock music as pioneered by Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, with elements of both yet devoid of songs. One track per side: the power-drive storming ""Amboss"" and the shimmering timeless ""Traummaschine"". A yin-and-yang type concept that was followed on further albums. 

Schulze departed after the band's debut, with lots of other musicians passing through the group for their second album Schwingungen. The record had psychedelic blues numbers on one side, and a deep space trip on the other. The same concept appearing on the similarly balanced Seven Up collaboration with acid guru [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/21068-Dr-Timothy-Leary]Timothy Leary[/url].

Formed in 1989 by four co-workers at the Rosenlund hospital, Clawfinger comprised of Jocke Skog (b. 3 June 1969, Stockholm, Sweden; programming, vocals), Zak Tell (b. 16 November 1970, Stockholm, Sweden; vocals), Erlend Ottem (b. 13 December 1968, Molde, Norway; guitar) and Bård Torstensen (b. 13 September 1961, Arendal, Norway; guitar). They immediately received international praise for their fluid but powerful alternative rock sound. Their debut single, 1993's ""Nigger"", also provoked great controversy. Although the subject matter was profoundly anti-racist, many critics wondered as to the wisdom of its title. The media quickly categorized Clawfinger alongside American outfits such as Rage Against The Machine, who similarly combined political activism with a musical scope that ranged from hardcore rap to metal. The band's debut album, Deaf Dumb Blind, expanded their repertoire to encompass funk and even jazz flourishes. It was promoted in the USA on tours with Anthrax and Alice In Chains, while Clawfinger remained rooted in their national charts with a joint EP with Swedish rappers Just D. In 1995 the band, now expanded to a six-piece with the addition of André Skaug (b. Sunndalsøra, Norway; bass) and Ottar Vigerstøl (drums), launched their ""Back To The Basics"" European tour, which saw them play in 12 European countries within a few weeks.

The band took a break before starting work on their self-titled third album, which featured session drummer Henka Johansson (b. Karlskoga, Sweden). Johansson was later added to the line-up as the band embarked on an extensive tour. Their fourth album, A Whole Lot Of Nothing, was released in 2001 followed by Zeros & Heroes in 2003.

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

In December 1997 the band was put on a permanent halt as Nödtveidt was arrested for killing a man earlier that year. He was later sentenced to 10 years in prison for assistance to murder and illegal possession of a firearm.

In 2003 Nödtveidt announced the comeback of Dissection and the renewed band eventually returned to the stage on October 30th, 2004 at the Arenan in Stockholm. Soon after the release of their third album “Reinkaos” on April 30th, 2006, Nödveidt announced the end of Dissection as he “had reached the limitations of music as a tool for expression and with Reinkaos they had managed to manifest a truly Satanic record and the work of Dissection had been done. Now it was time to move on to other realms of practice.” Their final concert was performed on June 24th, 2006 at Hovet, Stockholm. About two months later, on August 13th, 2006, Jon Nödtveidt committed suicide.

Music-wise, Dissection combined various styles of extreme metal with a strong melodic sensibility and a sinister/melancholic atmosphere.

During the winter solstice of 2009 the band traveled to Semaphore Studios in Chicago to record ""When All Became None"" with filth pusher Sanford Parker. In March of 2010 the band consecrated several showcases at SXSW through excessive volume and all praise for the beast. ""When All Became None"" was released in April of 2010 and met with praise from Decibel, Invisible Oranges, Metal Maniacs, and Terrorizer Magazine (who had also named the album one of 2010's most anticipated releases) in addition to other publications. [l=Seventh Rule Recordings] unleashed the vinyl version of ""When All Became None"" in August of 2010. The band traveled eastward to Brooklyn and once again communed with [a=Unearthly Trance] for high volume rituals, making stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore before returning home. The remaining months of 2010 saw the band retooling personnel, with drummer C. moving to guitar and J. (longtime ally and artist behind the visuals of ""When All Became None"") stepping in behind the kit.

63108,94820,513841,US,Jars Of Clay,If I Left The Zoo,1999,42.87,11,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Alternative Rock', 'Acoustic']","Jars of Clay began at Greenville College, Illinois, in 1992 (though they weren't using that name at this stage). In those early days, Charlie Lowell and Dan Haseltine were joined by [a=Matt Bronleewe] after discovering they shared similar musical tastes, and began working on various studio projects as well as performing with different college bands. In 1993, Stephen Mason was accepted into the college due to the strength of his audition piece 'Frail' (then an instrumental guitar track), and met Dan because of a Toad The Wet Sprocket t-shirt he was wearing, the two sharing an admiration for that band's unique sound. This original foursome then decided to write and record a song together purely for credit in a recording class. That song, 'Fade To Grey' became popular throughout the college, and the band performed it the 'Underground Cafe'. After the success of this performance, they decided to write more songs to add to their repertoire as well as to continue satisfying their course criteria. They also decided that if they were going to continue performing, they needed to give themselves a name. Charlie recalled a verse from 2 Corinthians 4:7 that included the phrase 'Jars of Clay' and the band decided that this would be a good way to remind themselves to stay humble. In 1994, Jars of Clay was born.

Also in 1994, Charlie suggested to the band that they enter a talent contest he had seen advertised in a CCM magazine. On April 27th, Jars of Clay performed at the Gospel Music Association Spotlight Competition, and met with great popular and critical praise. April continued to be busy as the band released its demo album ""Frail"", (which was limited to a run of 1000 and is now the most highly sought after piece of Jars of Clay memorabilia). This demo, combined with their GMA win, garnered the band a lot of record label interest, and eventually they signed with [l=Essential Records (3)], then a small, fledgling label that nevertheless had the distribution power of both Brentwood Music and Silvertone. By this stage, Matt Bronleewe had decided to leave the band and continue his studies, rather than move with the others to Nashville to record their debut album. This left a hole in the group that was filled when Charlie called an old school friend of his, Matt Odmark, and asked him if he would be interested in the spot. Matt accepted and in May 1995 they released their self-titled debut to massive critical and popular acclaim. The first single to be lifted from the album, 'Flood', became a No. 1 hit on both secular and Christian charts, helping the album go 2x Platinum, and seeing the band tour with the likes of Sting, Sheryl Crowe, Michael W. Smith and PFR.

Jars of Clay are considered to be one of the most creative and artistic bands in the US, and not only amongst Christian audiences. Though their name is not as prevalent in the secular scene as it once was, it is still associated with the very highest of production values and creative output, and the band still maintains a very loyal and dedicated fan base, and have performed all over the world, including Australia, the UK, the Philippines, and Singapore. In 2001, Jars of Clay received Honourary Degrees from Greenville College, since Dan, Charlie and Steve never finished their original degrees. The band has always been open about their Christian beliefs, but do not consider themselves to be a 'Christian' band, more a band whose members are Christians. All four men are now married and most have started families of their own. When touring, the group is expanded to include a drummer (formerly Scott Savage and [a=Joe Porter (2)], currently [a=Jeremy Lutito]) and a bassist (formerly [a=Aaron Sands], currently [a=Gabe Ruschival]), and on occasion has included string players. Jars of Clay continue to be one of the most influential bands in the CCM industry as well as maintaining a high degree of respect in the music industry in general."

17479,278687,2472452,USA & Canada,Bad Religion,The Dissent of Man,2010,42.85,15,['Album'],['Rock'],['Punk'],"Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

170341,5930,373492,Europe,Satyricon,Nemesis Divina,1996,42.75,8,['Album'],['Rock'],['Black Metal'],"Black metal band from Oslo, Norway, founded in 1991. 

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

The two had jammed together since fall 1993 and wanted to start a band. Christer's brother Peter, 14 was recruited for vocal duties. 
Bassist Eystein Holm joined on 17 May 1994 as the band was rehearsing for a show that day. 
In an interview, Peter explained the band's name: ""Extol means to exalt, to lift up what you give glory to, and that's what's we're all about. 
We want to give God all the glory with our lives and with our music."" 
Extol wanted to expand their musical style beyond regular heavy metal music to show more of a progressive side. 
The style change necessitated another guitarist, a position Emil Nikolaisen of the band Royal filled in 1995.

The group soon garnered a reputation in the local scene. 
In January 1996, Extol made their first record appearance on a Norwegian metal compilation called Northern Lights. 
The album featured other local Christian artists Antestor, Schaliach, and Groms. 
Steve Rowe of Australian Christian metal band Mortification released the compilation on his record label, Rowe Productions. 
The band ventured to Stockholm, Sweden two months later for their first show outside their homeland. 
At the end of 1996, Nikolaisen departed so he could devote more time to Royal, and was replaced by Ole Børud of Schaliach and Arnold B Family.

In 1997, Extol released an independent three-song demo: Embraced. A studio album ([r24468086]) was recorded at the end of the year even though a record label had not signed them. 
Almost a year passed before Endtime Productions picked up the band. 
Their debut album, Burial, was released in December 1998. 
The album was licensed in the United States on Solid State Records, and in Japan on Avalon Records. 
Critical reception was very positive from Christian and secular publications.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

The band recorded a few demos, and began playing shows throughout the suburban sprawl of Southern California alongside bands like Incubus, Linkin Park, Hoobastank, and Audiovent; all of which would find fame on major labels looking for the next loud thing. Soon, Hotwire got its chance, as well, and signed with RCA in December 2000. After working with a variety of big-name producers, the band issued a promotional four-song EP in late 2002. The set generated buzz for Hotwire’s debut full-length Routine, which dropped in June 2003. Its release was timed to coincide with the band’s appearances on that summer’s Ozzfest.

Soon after The Routine was released, band went on hiatus and disbanded. Vocalist Rus Martin joined alternative rock band Skyscraper Frontier and guitarist Gabriel Garcia formed The Transfatal Express, both under Coming Home Records.

Aaron, Drew and Jamin had all been in bands signed to major labels, so they knew what they didn’t want when they got together and worked on songs without a recording deal, then proceeded to build a local following through the Internet and playing live.

The group recorded a five-song EP, featuring “Mama’s Room,” distributing it at their shows and on-line. Most of that release survived intact on the band’s debut album, both of which were produced by former Blind Melon members Brad Smith and Christopher Thorne.

Under the Influence of Giants is an unlikely album for a group of twenty-somethings who aren’t afraid to cite Olivia Newton-John’s “Let’s Get Physical” and Bob James’ Heads album as inspirations.

Danzig morphed out of the goth punk band Samhain after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin. Rubin was interested in working with Glenn, but not with Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group. Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von and guitarist John Christ and for drums Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. The original line-up recorded band’s first four albums, but during the mid-90’s the group started to disintegrate with first Chuck Biscuits leaving the group and soon after John Christ and Eerie Von followed. At the time Glenn also came at odds with producer Rubin and his label and the two ended collaborations as well.

Following the line-up turmoil Glenn took distance from the blues driven heavy metal that Danzig had become known for and introduced strong industrial sound on “Danzig 5: Blackaciddevil”, a move that was not received well by fans or critics. After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band returned to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, but have not managed to recapture the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records had.

Current line up:

They were soon joined by [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thyme+(2)]Thyme[/url] (vocals) and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rym+(2)]Rym[/url] (guitar) and then they recorded their first demo entitled ""Pagan Land"". The demo was recorded in a studio called Haga Audio which unfortunately didn't have any experience with Black Metal so it didn't turn out good and the response wasn't that good either. In 1995 the band recorded the song 'Et Vinterland I Nord' which was going to feature on a compilation CD for local bands in Sarpsborg. It turned out to be great so the band sent out the song to various labels and media. The response was positive so they re-recorded the demo in a different studio called X-Ray Studios and this time it turned out to be great and shortly after they were signed to [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Head+Not+Found]Head Not Found[/url] Records. They soon entered the studio once again and recorded their debut album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/767493]Nattferd[/url]"" which was released same year. They also played their first gig right after the release. 

In 1996 the band was unsatisfied with the label so they decided to leave them but the label quickly offered them a better deal and then they were re-signed for two more albums. They also played at the famous Elm Street bar in Oslo together with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Old+Man%27s+Child]Old Man's Child[/url] and shortly after [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Century+Media]Century Media[/url] wanted to sign them but they had to say no because of the contract with their label. In 1997 they entered the studio to record their second album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/388046]Arising Realm[/url]"" which featured [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shagrath]Shagrath[/url] of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dimmu+Borgir]Dimmu Borgir[/url] on keyboard. In 1998 they went on their first tour with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Siebenb%C3%BCrgen]Siebenbürgen[/url] from Sweden and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Atanatos]Atanatos[/url] from Germany and played one gig in Denmark and seven in Germany and they also played at ""The Hellraiser Festival"" in Leipzig, Germany. 

At the end of the year recordings for the third album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/767503]Diabolical Age[/url]"" began and this time it took place in Endless Studio in Oslo. The following year, during the mixing, which had to be done five times, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thyme+(2)]Thyme[/url] left the band because of other interests. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rym+(2)]Rym[/url] had also come up with new material and thought it would be best with another guitarist so Sander of Shadow Dancers became a member. In 2000 they finally found a replacement for [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thyme+(2)]Thyme[/url], his name was Astaroth. Shortly after ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/767503]Diabolical Age[/url]"" was finally released and the band then played at ""Under the Black Sun Festival"" in Germany.

It was a self-financed tour and it was also tough for the band since Rym was forced to stay home. The pressure showed that Astaroth wasn't the right man for the band so he was kicked after the tour was over. The contract also ended so the band searched for a new label. 

In 2001 [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lord+Arcamous]Lord Arcamous[/url] became a full-time member and also took over vocals and the band also sent out material to labels and were soon signed to Swedish label [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Regain+Records]Regain Records[/url].

It turned out to be one of the worst tours ever arranged. Problems constantly occured and after the tour was over [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lord+Arcamous]Lord Arcamous[/url] left the band. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jontho]Jontho[/url] took part in playing drums on [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tsjuder]Tsjuders[/url] album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/540664]Demonic Possession[/url]"" and also played with them at ""Under the Black Sun Festival"" in Germany.

He then asked him if he wanted to play with Ragnarok. After the tour he did the vocals for a [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Celtic+Frost]Celtic Frost[/url] cover and it turned out great and he then became a member of the band. 

New material was made and the band also embarked on a European tour, ""X-mass Festivals"", with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Six+Feet+Under]Six Feet Under[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Exodus+(6)]Exodus[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Marduk+(2)]Marduk[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Macabre]Macabre[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Impaled+Nazarene]Impaled Nazarene[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Immolation]Immolation[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hate+Eternal]Hate Eternal[/url] and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Antaeus]Antaeus[/url].

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently between that time and their break-up in 2011. Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.

Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 (Performers) and Roxy Music frontman [a87721] was awarded a CBE by Her Majesty the Queen of England on 30 November 2011.

Similarly, Roxy Music have had success with some of their 49 single/EP releases. In this case, there has been a chart entry for 18 of these releases, with one single making the No.1 spot. In February 1981, Roxy Music hit the singles chart 'top spot' with the John Lennon composed song ‘[m=58331]’ and spent 2 weeks at that coveted position, 9 weeks in the chart’s Top 40 (6 weeks in the Top 10) and 11 weeks overall.

The 18 Roxy Music hit singles/EPs have spent time in the UK Top 40 music charts for 128 weeks, with 44 of these within the Top 10. The single with the most time in the UK Charts is ‘[m=58323]’, which entered the charts in April 1979 and overall spent 14 weeks charting.

It was not until years after the band's demise that their singles, as well as all three full length albums, saw re-release through various labels, most notably Relapse Records. 

While Harvey Milk invariably draws comparisons to the [a=Melvins], due to their penchant for slow, heavy riffs, the band has touched upon such artists as [a=ZZ Top], [a=Led Zeppelin] and [a=Leonard Cohen] as influences in their music. They even went so far as to perform a live show consisting of nothing but [a=Hank Williams] covers. 

They are named after [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/334950-Harvey-Milk-2]Harvey Milk[/url], San Francisco, California's first openly gay city supervisor, who was murdered in 1978.

Harvey Milk's historic core (Creston Spiers, Stephen Tanner & Paul Trudeau) reunited in 2006 to record ""Special Wishes""."
17479,249201,2285298,,Bad Religion,30 Years Live,2010,42.07,17,"['MP3', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Punk'],"Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

In 1999, the band independently released their self titled EP (referred to as ""The Green Album""). At this time, they were also opening for bands such as Amen, Disturbed, Nickelback and Nothingface.

They later signed with Arista Records, where they released two major label albums in One Nation Under (which features many re-recorded songs from their self titled album) (2001) and My So-Called Life (2003). They had two music videos which are for their songs ""Check Ya"" and ""Smack"", both of which can be viewed over on You Tube. Before the recording of My So-Called Life, bassist Rob Ruccia left the band to do production work on other bands, leaving vocalist Jett to record the bass for the album. They later recruited Avi Kopernik to play bass for the group's live shows.

After being dropped by Arista less than a month after the release of My So-Called Life, they went to work preparing for their third album. As time went on, writing music became a chore and Jett with nothing to fall back on, needed to concentrate on a day job to support his family. Joe Pettinato, who already had a construction business, then left the band, and the rest of the group called it quits in 2005. Two songs from the intended album, ""Middle of the Road"" and ""My Own Destiny"", can still be streamed on their official PureVolume page.

Began as a black metal band and transitioned into more of a blackened death metal band.

It was in 1991 that Behemoth was formed (initially as Baphomet) by frontman Nergal (Holocausto at that time). They released a few demos: ""Endless Damnation"" (1992), ""The Return Of The Northern Moon"" (1993) and ""From The Pagan Vastlands"" (1993), the latter being the material that really showed what they wanted. They signed with an Italian label Entropy Productions and released their debut mini-album entitled ""And The Forests Dream Eternally"" in 1994. A year later they recorded their first full-length ""Sventevith (Storming Near The Baltic)"". The album gave them the attention they wanted and they got a deal with the German Solistitium Records, where they also recorded and released their second album ""Grom,"" a very experimental album, which included female vocals, synths and acoustic guitar. They also finally did a European tour where they gained stage experience and a good reputation.

In 1997 they did a split with Damnation, re-released ""The Return Of The Northern Moon"" and recorded their third album ""Pandemonic Incantations"", which featured a new drummer, Inferno.
In 1998 they got a two album record deal with Italian Avantgarde Music. They released ""Satanica"" 1999 and it was a huge success and secured the band tour support to Deicide and Satyricon.
In 2001 they released ""Thelema.6"" which gained them even more fame and led them to the European tour X-Mass Festivals, Wacken Open Air, With Full Force, Inferno Festival, Mystic Festival, Mind Over Matter etc....
In 2002 they started work on their 6th album. They gave it the title ""Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)"". One of their most impressive albums to date (the band had spent almost 700 hours making it).

In 2003 they released the EP ""Conjuration"".

The band used to be a Christian band but no longer associates with the Christian music scene and thinks Religion and Music should stay separate. This change was made because while for most of the bands' career all the members were Christian, by the time they split in 2013 they had some non-Christian members. These members felt alienated and it caused lots of issues within the band, so the band made the choice to keep their beliefs to themself and just be a non-Christian rock band. As of 2018 the only member of Underoath that still publicly identified as Christian was Christopher Dudley."

Founded in 1993 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Danzig morphed out of the goth punk band Samhain after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin. Rubin was interested in working with Glenn, but not with Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group. Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von and guitarist John Christ and for drums Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. The original line-up recorded band’s first four albums, but during the mid-90’s the group started to disintegrate with first Chuck Biscuits leaving the group and soon after John Christ and Eerie Von followed. At the time Glenn also came at odds with producer Rubin and his label and the two ended collaborations as well.

Following the line-up turmoil Glenn took distance from the blues driven heavy metal that Danzig had become known for and introduced strong industrial sound on “Danzig 5: Blackaciddevil”, a move that was not received well by fans or critics. After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band returned to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, but have not managed to recapture the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records had.

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently between that time and their break-up in 2011. Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.

Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 (Performers) and Roxy Music frontman [a87721] was awarded a CBE by Her Majesty the Queen of England on 30 November 2011.

Roxy Music have released 28 albums and 38 compilations since the band’s inception back in 1971. Of these, 18 have made the ‘UK Top 40’ music charts with 11 of them reaching the ‘Top 10’ and 4 albums reaching the No.1 position. The albums to hit the top spot are ‘[m=58357]’ (Dec 1973), ‘[m=41847]’ (May 1980), ‘[m=58313]’ (Jun 1982) and ‘[m58362]’ (Apr 1986). These four albums cumulatively spent 13 weeks at the No.1 position. All 18 charting albums, have in total, been in the chart’s Top 10 for 76 weeks and within the Top 40 for 260 weeks.

Similarly, Roxy Music have had success with some of their 49 single/EP releases. In this case, there has been a chart entry for 18 of these releases, with one single making the No.1 spot. In February 1981, Roxy Music hit the singles chart 'top spot' with the John Lennon composed song ‘[m=58331]’ and spent 2 weeks at that coveted position, 9 weeks in the chart’s Top 40 (6 weeks in the Top 10) and 11 weeks overall.

The 18 Roxy Music hit singles/EPs have spent time in the UK Top 40 music charts for 128 weeks, with 44 of these within the Top 10. The single with the most time in the UK Charts is ‘[m=58323]’, which entered the charts in April 1979 and overall spent 14 weeks charting.

Roxy Music’s first album to enter the UK Charts was the self-entitled ‘[m=58135]’ (Island ILPS9200) making its debut on 29/07/1972.  It stayed in the charts for 16 weeks with its highest position being no.10. The album briefly reappeared in February 2018 under the HDCD release (Virgin ROXYCD1) for one week reaching no.47.

Freddy 'Fred the Shred' Bolsø (drums) and Erlend Caspersen (bass) soon joined the band and with help from studio vocalists Ronny Thorsen and Vidar Helseth the band recorded the demo ""DeathMix 2000"" in 2000. They got a few offers and decided to sign with Hammerheart Records. 

Two weeks before the recording of their debut album, ""Monument of Death"", they were joined by Mr. Hustler (vocals). The album was released in 2001 and included a limited edition package called 'The Suicide Kit' which not only contained the actual album, but also a printed razorblade and a poster. The kits were hand numbered in the band member's own blood. 

In May 2002 a compilation album entitled ""A Taste for Blood"" was released. It included material from ""DeathMix 2000"" and a cover song by Massacre plus more. Shortly after Freddy Bolsø had to leave the band due to work commitments but he was quickly replaced by Espen 'Beist' Antonsen from Norwegian Black Metal band Slagmark. The band also played at Inferno Festival together with label mates Exmortem. 

In 2003 ""Affiliated with the Suffering"" was released and afterwards they signed a world wide multi-album deal with Earache Records. Their fourth release called ""Altered Genesis"" was released in 2005, the last with Mr. Hustler on vocals.

New vocalist Vald joined in 2006, together with permanent drummer Anders Haave. The first album with this lineup, ""Come Death"", was released in 2007. Following this album, the last Earache Records album to be released was ""Souls of Damnation"" in 2009. After this release, Tchort decided to have a break to focus on his family and work. Nevertheless, the band went out on their first headliner European Tour in October 2009 with Hate. This was the first tour with only Død on guitar. 
Anders decided to leave the band late 2009. He was replaced with the Swedish wonder boy, Emil Wiksten.

Ivan ""Meathook"" Gujic joined as a session guitarist in 2010, and they played their first ever show in Mexico, featuring Mr. Hustler on vocals (as Vald could not make the trip).
One of Blood Red Throne's career highlights happened at the end of 2010, when they went on tour with Dimmu Borgir and Enslaved across the United States and Canada.

In 2011 Meathook became a permanent member, they signed with Sevared Records, and released their 6th studio album Brutalitarian Regime. They also toured the US and Canada again, this time with Grave.

Erlend Caspersen and Vald decided to leave due to family and work related issues in October 2011. They were replaced by Ole Bent Madsen on bass guitar and Yngve ""Bolt"" Christiansen on vocals December 2011. 

In 2012, they toured with Suffocation in Europe, and also played Hellfest festival in France.

They later signed with Arista Records, where they released two major label albums in One Nation Under (which features many re-recorded songs from their self titled album) (2001) and My So-Called Life (2003).

After being dropped by Arista less than a month after the release of My So-Called Life, they went to work preparing for their third album.

Over the course of acclaimed LPs like 1987's You're Living All Over Me and 1988's Bug, the group emerged among the most highly regarded in alternative rock, with [b]J Mascis[/b]' creaky, [a=Neil Young]-like vocals and monolithic guitar leads becoming primary influences on the burgeoning grunge movement. The group temporarily disbanded in 1989, largely to allow the legendarily non-communicative singer the opportunity to dismiss bassist [a=Lou Barlow], who went on to form [a=Sebadoh]; in the meantime, [b]J Mascis[/b] sat in on drums with a series of bands, among them [a154053] and GobbleHoof, even producing the latter's eponymous 1990 LP. Upon re-forming Dinosaur Jr. in 1991, he scored Allison Anders' independent film Gas Food Lodging a year later, making a cameo appearance in the picture itself; he and Anders became regular collaborators in the years to follow, most notably on her feature Grace of My Heart. In the meantime, [b]J Mascis[/b] also produced records for pals including fIREHOSE (Mr. Machinery Operator) and Tad (Inhaler), and in 1996 issued his solo debut Martin and Me. After 1997's Hand It Over, Dinosaur Jr. disbanded. Keeping on with his personal musical eclecticism, [b]J Mascis[/b] and his new outfit [a293242] issued More Light in fall 2000. Featuring appearances from avant garde guitarist [a=Kevin Shields] and [a=Guided By Voices] vocalist Bob Pollard, the record was a fine return to form that excited Dinosaur Jr. fans who had been disappointed with his acoustic record. A tour with Elf Power followed, featuring longtime friend [a=Mike Watt] on bass and [a39770] guitarist Ron Asheton at several tour dates. It was his riff-heavy jams with Asheton and Watt that inspired much of the music he started writing for his follow-up, as well as several skydiving experiences. When he stepped back into the studio, he kept the guest appearances down to a minimum and recorded Feel So Free for a 2002 release. DInosaur Jr. reformed with its original lineup in 2005, and have released 4 studio albums since."

Coal Chamber are led by gruff vocalist Dez Fafara and operate in territory somewhere between the traditional hard riffing of Black Sabbath and the sensationalist techno rock of Marilyn Manson. Fafara met guitarist Miguel ""Meegs' Rascon through a classified ad, and they later added drummer Mike Cox and bass player Rayna Foss, the room-mate of Fafara's future wife.

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002. The band was further unsettled when Cox departed the same September. Coal Chamber split in 2003.

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

The Daysleepers were formed in November 2004, in Buffalo, New York by Jeff Kandefer who gathered some friends from other bands in the local music scene that shared a love of ambient, etheriel indie rock. The Daysleepers are a self-release band Rain Delay Music, an independent shoegaze record label. The goal is to create a huge volume of recordings in which the band will have complete control and rights to.

The Daysleepers Debut EP ""Hide Your Eyes"" (December 2005) won the band many fans around the world (selling out the first pressing), and praise from shoegaze legends such as Robin Guthrie (Cocteau Twins), Rachel Goswell and Neil Halstead of Slowdive. It also hit 1 for several weeks on the Tonevendor (Renowned Shoegaze Distributor) top 20 record sales list.

In October 2006 The Daysleepers released their 2nd EP ""The Soft Attack"". This EP shows a heavier side of the bands sound, with etheriel guitars spinning way into outerspace, and vocal melodies that hauntingly soar to new heights.

Their first full album ""Drowned in a Sea of Sound"" was released in May 2008 and builds on their earlier music while retaining their trademark vocals, drums, and density of sound.

(Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.) The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years.

The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.

Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers. Another noteworthy aspect of W&C's sound is the absence of drums.

In 1998, the band signed to [l=Hellcat Records], a label run by members of [a=Rancid] and connected to [l=Epitaph Records].  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.

Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old [a=Woody Guthrie] poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".

SKINLESS exploded onto the metal scene in 1992. Despite a variety of lineup changes, the songwriting team of Noah Carpenter (guitars) and Sherwood Webber (vocals) has remained constant since 1994. After adding the talents of Bob Beaulac (drums) and Joe Keyser (bass) SKINLESS established a solid, dedicated line-up, recorded two demos and appeared on numerous compilations.

In 1998, SKINLESS released their full-length debut 'Progression Towards Evil.' Recorded at Max Trax Studios in Albany, NY 'Progression...' stunned the underground, showcasing the musicianship and energy that the band had become known for via its intense live performances. An entirely independent release, 'Progression...' received frenzied acclaim from press the world over and saw remarkable sales. SKINLESS embarked on three immensely successful tours in support of 'Progression...' introducing legions of fans to the punishing live SKINLESS experience. The band toured the US with underground legends MORTICIAN on 1999's Chainsaw Tour, and in the Spring of 2000, SKINLESS toured the U.S. and Mexico with INCANTATION, spawning even more followers of the brutal underground revolution. Their subsequent European headlining tour claimed further disciples.

On their Relapse debut 'Foreshadowing Our Demise,' SKINLESS painted violent pictures of utter devastation. 'Foreshadowing Our Demise' sonically documented the endless energy of the band's burly live performances, delivering an annihilating combination of punishing grooves and ultimate brutality. SKINLESS' gut-twisting deathgrind deluged listeners with colossal riffs, chaotic percussion and Webber's scathing vocal attack. SKINLESS toured as much as possible in 2001/2002, being personally invited to hit the road with the likes of HATEBREED and SIX FEET UNDER, thus furthering their growing following.

Over time, the line-up would fluxuate, with Reese leaving, and vocalist Vance Bockis and guitarist Norman Lawson passing through the ranks.  Finally, as a trio consisting of Weinrich (now handling vocals and guitar), Laue, and Flood, the band released their debut 7"", commonly known as ""Sodden Jackal"".  The band made a name for themselves in and around Maryland, even gaining a following in Washington DC's famous hardcore punk scene, and made an appearance on a ""Metal Massacre"" compilation.  Flood was eventually replaced by [a=Ed Gulli] and this line-up recorded a tape together in 1985 but were unable to find anyone to release it.  Faced with a lack of success and label disinterest, the group disbanded shortly afterwards.  However, word of the band reached Saint Vitus, whose singer, [a=Scott Reagers], had announced his departure from the band, and they asked Wino to join.  The Obsessed tape began making the rounds in tape-trading circles and, soon enough, [l=Hellhound Records], Saint Vitus's German record label, offered to release it.  To support its release, Wino put a new version of the band, consisting of drummer [a=Greg Rogers] and bassist [a=Scott Reeder] (who replaced Danny Hood, who was killed in a motorcycle accident shortly after joining the Obsessed), for a tour.  However, after the tour, Wino decided to quit Saint Vitus for reasons that remain a point of contention between Wino and Vitus leader [a=Dave Chandler].  Wino maintained that he received Chandler's blessing for the release of the Obsessed album and subsequent tour but upon returning home was unhappy with the new material Chandler was writing and upset that the band chose [a=Don Dokken] to produce their next album.  Chandler claimed that he was apprehensive about the Obsessed project and that Wino lost interest in Saint Vitus because of it.  In any case, the Obsessed was now Wino's full-time band the group recorded ""Lunar Womb"" for Hellhound in 1991.  Dissatisfied with Hellhound, Wino accepted a record deal with Columbia Records for the band's next album ""The Church Within"", which saw [a=Guy Pinhas] replace Scott Reeder.  However, life on a major label was not much better.  The label pulled promotion for the album just as it was being released and it was a commercial failure.  The band soon split and, for a time, Wino sank into substance abuse.  However, he eventually managed to clean himself up and, after living for a number of years in Los Angeles, returned to Maryland were he fronted [a=Spirit Caravan] and [a=The Hidden Hand] before going solo.

For the tour following the release of the band's fourth album, [i]Moonmadness[/i] (1976), they were joined by former [a=King Crimson] sax player and flautist [a=Mel Collins]. In early 1977 Ferguson left and was replaced by [a=Richard Sinclair] (from [a=Caravan]) as the band moved to a jazzier sound. By  the end of 1978 a series of personnel changes included the departures of Bardens, Sinclair and Collins and the additions of [a=Colin Bass], [a=Kit Watkins] and [a=Jan Schelhaas].  Their seventh studio album, [i]I Can See Your House From Here[/i] was problematic for advertisers due to the cover art: a crucified astronaut looking at Earth.  It also marked Camel's return to the UK charts at number 45. The band had three further studio albums, a live album and numerous personnel changes before disbanding in 1984.

Latimer, the last original member, revived the Camel name in 1991. With various lineups four more studio albums were recorded by 2002. The band played a farewell tour in 2003. It was later disclosed that Latimer was ill and underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in 2007. He had recovered sufficiently to revive the band in 2013, recording a new version of [i]The Snow Goose[/i] as a tribute to the late Peter Bardens. The band has toured regularly since 2013 and remains active."

The origins of the group came from a collaboration between vocalist Daniel Higgs and bassist John Chriest where Chriest would create sound collages and loops for Higgs' poetry readings.  The duo eventually hooked up with guitarist Asa Osborne, who had done a stint in the hardcore band [a=Reptile House (2)] with Higgs and after briefly working with another drummer, they added Mitchell Feldstein to the group.  Early on, Higgs decamped for San Francisco, leaving the band's future in doubt.  Lungfish's debut release, ""Necklace of Heads"" was intended as document of the songs they'd written to that point and was released through the joint effort of the [l=Simple Machines] and [l=Dischord Records] labels.

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

From The Melvins, Ratos de Porão, and Alice in Chains to The Dillinger Escape Plan, Soundgarden, and Converge, Irist fold in, twist fervently, and scorch their faves until they’re decidedly protean and uniquely a product of the fivesome’s songwriting prowess. Irist have an uncanny ability to write songs—massive songs—that are absurdly memorable and super-charged. At once a representative of contemporary anxiety and old-fashioned aggression, Order of the Mind is hewn from the very same things that made Sepultura’s Chaos A.D., Machine Head’s Burn My Eyes, Mastodon’s Crack the Skye, and Gojira’s The Way of All Flesh so timeless and irrepressibly great. In short, Irist’s debut, Order of the Mind, is a must-hear. "

Brother of [a1690648]
Of Welsh origin, he spent most of his childhood in Aberystwyth. His musical debut dates back to 1972, when Alan released on [l=Harvest] the prog-rock album ""Aria"", a brilliant experimental effort, also featuring such famed artists as jazz violinist [a=Jean-Luc Ponty] - whose consistent contribution is fully enjoyable especially in the A-sidelong title-track suite.

Alan's second full-length album ""Come un vecchio incensiere all'alba di un villaggio deserto""  - which followed in 1973 - was more or less along the same lines as the former, but it lacked its freshness and originality.

The third, self-titled LP - including a new version of the Neapolitan classic ""Dicitencello vuje"", previously released as a single - was the most controversial of Alan's early production: While leaving somehow disappointed his traditional fans, nevertheless gave him a new popularity among a larger - and maybe, but not necessarily, less demanding - public.

In 1976, Alan came back with the disco-oriented album ""Sienteme, It's Time to Land"", including seven out of nine tracks sung in English, but hit it really big two years later, with the greatly successful release of ""Figli delle stelle"" (1978), a positively disco-oriented album which resulted in one of that year's best-selling LPs.

The following releases of ""L.A. & N.Y."" (1979) and ""Di notte"" (1980) - including the hit singles ""Tu sei l'unica donna per me"" and ""Non so che darei"" respectively - were equally successful, and helped Alan establish himself as a legitimate mainstream music star.

In 1981, Alan once again astonished his fans with the gritty rock single ""La strada brucia"", a solid but rather overlooked attempt to break new ground in his personal musical evolution.
Unfortunately, the two following albums ""Angeli della strada"" (1983) and, above all, the Buddhist-inspired ""Bonno Soku Bodai"" (1987) weren't up to both artistic and commercial expectations, marking a kind of [i]impasse[/i] in Alan's career.

""Radici"" - a compilation of hits including two new tracks, among which the outstanding ""Vola"" - was released in 1992, while a new collection of old hits, ""Miami"", came out in 1997, this time including three new tracks: The catchy dance tune ""Kyoko Mon Amour"", the romantic ""Una come te"", and ""Torna a Surriento"".

In 2003, Alan finally released a whole new album, ""Sottacqua"", launched by the hit single ""Paradiso Beach"", which was performed in duet with vocalist [a=Jenny B.].

SKINLESS exploded onto the metal scene in 1992. Despite a variety of lineup changes, the songwriting team of Noah Carpenter (guitars) and Sherwood Webber (vocals) has remained constant since 1994. After adding the talents of Bob Beaulac (drums) and Joe Keyser (bass) SKINLESS established a solid, dedicated line-up, recorded two demos and appeared on numerous compilations.

In 1998, SKINLESS released their full-length debut 'Progression Towards Evil.' Recorded at Max Trax Studios in Albany, NY 'Progression...' stunned the underground, showcasing the musicianship and energy that the band had become known for via its intense live performances. An entirely independent release, 'Progression...' received frenzied acclaim from press the world over and saw remarkable sales. SKINLESS embarked on three immensely successful tours in support of 'Progression...' introducing legions of fans to the punishing live SKINLESS experience. The band toured the US with underground legends MORTICIAN on 1999's Chainsaw Tour, and in the Spring of 2000, SKINLESS toured the U.S. and Mexico with INCANTATION, spawning even more followers of the brutal underground revolution. Their subsequent European headlining tour claimed further disciples.

On their Relapse debut 'Foreshadowing Our Demise,' SKINLESS painted violent pictures of utter devastation. 'Foreshadowing Our Demise' sonically documented the endless energy of the band's burly live performances, delivering an annihilating combination of punishing grooves and ultimate brutality. SKINLESS' gut-twisting deathgrind deluged listeners with colossal riffs, chaotic percussion and Webber's scathing vocal attack. SKINLESS toured as much as possible in 2001/2002, being personally invited to hit the road with the likes of HATEBREED and SIX FEET UNDER, thus furthering their growing following.

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

Recordings since 2000 have seen Kataklysm return to its extreme Metal roots and the band continues to record in this style."

Later that year they changed name to Immolation and the compilation album, ""Stepping on Angels...Before Dawn"", containing the demo albums, was released. 

In 1991 Neal Boback was replaced by Craig Smilowski and then the band recorded and released the album ""Dawn of Possession"" through Roadrunner Records. Five years passed and ""Here in After"" was released. During those years they also split from Roadrunner Records and were signed to Metal Blade instead. Alex Hernandez also replaced Craig Smilowski on drums. The band then embarked on several tours and in 1999 ""Failures for Gods"" was released. It was followed by ""Close to a World Below"" in 2000.

In 2010, Light This City began to become active again, after completing four reunion shows from April 8, 2010 to April 11, 2010.

The band has gone through countless line-ups and many former members have gone on to become significant figures in a variety of musical scenes.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles. This line-up lasted until 2004, when Jesse Pintado left the band. Currently the band consists of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and Danny Herrera.

The band was formed in 1981 in Venice, California by vocalist Mike Muir. Since the band's inception, Muir has been the group's only constant member, although rhythm guitarist Mike Clark was with the group from 1988 until 2013. The group started off as hardcore punk act and their 1983 self-titled debut scored an unexpected hit with the song ""Institutionalized"", which went into heavy rotation on the poplar SoCal radio station KROQ. It was a full two years later in 1985 when a video was produced and got heavy airplay on MTV. Meanwhile, in 1984 the group was banned from performing live in the city of Los Angeles, citing concerns about crowd violence. The ban remained in effect until the early 1990s. By the end of the 1980s, the band had evolved into a full-fledged thrash metal band and would soon begin adding more funk influences into their music. In 1995, the group announced their split, marking the end to their most commercially successful period. Mike Muir and Mike Clark would resurrect the band in 1996 with new members and the group continues to this day, although their recorded output has been sparse since reuniting. 

Throughout Suicidal's career, Muir has fronted a number of side-projects like [a=Los Cycos], [a=No Mercy (3)], [a=Infectious Grooves], and his own solo act, [a=Cyco Miko]. These acts have usually featured other members of Suicidal, as well."

The first and only demo was called ""Ungentle Exhumation"" and was released in the following year. In 1994 their first full-length was released, ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"", and it gained them succes and a good reputation in the underground. In 1996 they released the classic ""None So Vile"" which was a huge succes and surpassed other bands in terms of brutality. Sadly, Lord Worm left the band after the release. Michael DiSalvo (Infestation) later joined the band and he was the perfect replacement. After an impressive live show at the Milwaukee Metal Festival the band were signed to Century Media Records. 

With a new frontman and a record deal, the band recorded ""Whisper Supremacy"" which was released in 1998. They went on tours around the world and sales were up to 50,000 copies. Cryptopsy was becoming bigger and bigger and more live shows where played including the Dynamo Festival in Holland and several shows in Japan. 

After a wealth of tours the band returned to the studio and recorded ""And Then You'll Beg"" which was released in 2000. In August 2001, vocalist Michael DiSalvo was replaced by Martin Lacroix. In 2003 they released the live album, ""None So Live"", which was the last to feature Martin Lacroix as he left the band shortly after. His replacement was none other than the original vocalist, Lord Worm. In 2005, they recorded a new studio album entitled ""Once Was Not"". 

In 2008, ""The Unspoken King"" album marks the debut of Matt McGachy as well as the first and only appearance on a Cryptopsy album by Maggie Durand, as well as the band's departure from the death metal genre. The band instead perform deathcore on this album. 

After being on a record label for their entire career, Cryptopsy decided to go independent in 2012. Cryptopsy released independently the eponymous album on September 14, 2012. The album marked a return to their technical death metal sound.

In 2015, rather than a full album, Cryptopsy released the first instalment (Tome 1) of a series of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering. The band has said that The Book of Suffering Tome 1 is some of the most brutal, dark and technical music they have ever created."

Excluding the band's early years in the mid to late 1990's, Old Man's Child has been very much a solo project of Galder, who typically used the help of session musicians on albums and tours.

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

After releasing a handful of demo tapes in 1987 and 1988 and splitting up in 1988, they recorded the full-length album ""World Downfall"" posthumously in the now legendary Morrisound Recordings studio (Tampa, Florida) with engineer-guru Scott Burns. At the time of this recording Terrorizer's original bass player Garvey was in jail so David Vincent (MORBID ANGEL) filled in. 

Another interesting fact is that ""World Downfall"" consists of about 30% Nausea songs, including the title track.

Terrorizer's lyrics were typical socio-political grindcore lyrics with animal rights / environmental topics handled as well. 

The band members later joined other bands like NAPALM DEATH (Jesse), MORBID ANGEL (Pete) and NAUSEA (Garvey).

In 2006 Terrorizer released their long-awaited second album ""Darker Days Ahead"" which consists of half old demo songs and half new material. Shortly after the release of the album, Jesse Pintado passed away on 27 August 2006.

The band has been reactivated in 2008 demo-ing new songs. Guitar duties are now taken over by Katina, guitarist in Resistant Culture. 

According to the press release their third album ""Hordes of Zombies"" was recorded in 2011, slated for release on Season of Mist on 24 February 2012. However the album has reportedly already been recorded in 2009 before Pete Sandoval underwent back surgery.

Mouth of the Architect formed in 2003 with the lineup of Jason Watkins, Gregory Lahm, Dave Mann, Alex Vernon, and Derik Sommer. They released their first album Time and Withering in 2004 to positive reviews.

Soon after the band released a split with label mates Kenoma in 2006, Vernon left, leaving Lahm to record all the guitar parts on their second album The Ties That Blind which was released in August, and featured Brent Hinds of Mastodon on guest vocals on one track, and bass from Brian Cook of Botch, Russian Circles, and These Arms are Snakes. To support The Ties That Blind, the band toured extensively around the United States, first with These Arms Are Snakes in late 2006, then with 400 Blows and Unsane in May and June 2007.

Their latest album, Quietly, was recorded after Lahm in turn left the band, with Vernon returning alongside newcomer Steve Brooks to jointly handle guitars and vocals, with Kevin Schindel providing bass. Soon after the release of the album by Translation Loss Records, Vernon left yet again, with Schindel filling the guitar void.

Schindel, Vernon, Mann and Brooks have been members of the band Twelve Tribes at various points in the past.

Vomitory was formed in Sweden in 1989 by Urban Gustafsson (guitar), Ronnie Olson (bass), and Tobias Gustafsson (drums). In 1990, they played their first gig in their hometown of Forshaga. After the gig, Ronnie decided to concentrate on vocals, so Bengt Sund joined the band on bass. Bengt's friend Ulf Dalegren joined the band on guitar in 1991, and the band was now ready to record some material.

In 1992, they released their first demo, which got them in contact with Witchhunt Records. This led to the release of the 7"" single, ""Moribund"". Shortly after, Bengt Sund was asked to leave, before being replaced by Thomas Bergqvist. Labels had begun showing interest, so the band recorded a five track promo CD in the hopes of getting a record deal, but nothing happened. In 1994, they released the demo ""Through Sepulchral Shadows"", and in 1995 they went on a small, but successful tour through Poland.

In 1996, they inked a deal with Fadeless Records and released their debut album, ""Raped in Their Own Blood"". Following the release of the album, both Thomas and Ronnie left the band and were replaced by Erik Rundqvist (bass) and Jussi Linna (vocals). ""Redemption"" followed in 1999, along with two European tours, a split 7"" EP with Murder Corporation, and the 10"" LP entitled ""Anniversary Picture Disc"". In 2000, the band signed to Metal Blade Records and released their third album, ""Revelation Nausea"". However, prior to recording the album, Jussi Linna had left the group. Thus, Erik Rundqvist handled both vocal and bass duties. 

""Blood Rapture"" was released in 2002, and was followed by their fifth album ""Primal Massacre"" in 2004. Guitarist Ulf Dalegren departed in 2005, with Peter Östlund stepping in shortly after. With this lineup, the band released ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize"" in 2007, ""Carnage Euphoria"" in 2009 and ""Opus Mortis VIII"" in 2011. 

In February 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding, playing their final show on December 27, 2013. In 2017, the band reunited for one show to honor an old friend. On March 23, 2018, Vomitory officially reunited to celebrate 30 years since the band's formation."

To date they have released three full length albums and two EP's.

The Beginning (1999–2004)
No Bragging Rights was formed by vocalist, Mike Perez, when he was at the age of fifteen. They have released several demo recordings between 2001 and 2004. These recordings include ""Never Again Demo"" (2001), ""The Razor Apologies"" EP (2002), and ""Waking Angel Demo"" (2004). Ryan Sievers, Jose Mendoza, Anthony McCabe, Cody Henderson, Jamieson Stuart, and Chris Williams have all been credited for taking part in recording said releases. After several lineup changes they decided to pursue a more melodic hardcore and punk influenced sound.

2005–present
In 2005, No Bragging Rights began writing their first full length album titled ""Because You Believe in Something Beyond Them"" which was self-released in early 2006. This album was well received in the local music scene of Southern California and helped to establish the band outside of their hometown. Shortly after, “The Anatomy of a Martyr” EP was self-released in the summer of 2007, and brought No Bragging Rights to the national stage. This album was later re-released by Stand By Records.

Relentless ""do it yourself"" touring widened the band's fan base and attracted the attention of Pure Noise Records.The label re-released “The Anatomy of a Martyr” in 2008, and debuted the full length album ""The Consequences of Dreams"" in early 2009. That year No Bragging Rights played Taste of Chaos 2009 at The House of Blues, in San Diego, California, with Bring Me the Horizon and several other bands.

The following year they released two singles titled ""Passion Vs. Fashion"" and ""Unafraid to Burn"". ""Passion Vs. Fashion"" was released on the compilation album ""Vans 2010 Warped Tour Compilation."" ""Unafraid to Burn"" was released on the ""Atticus V"" compilation album In January 2011, No Bragging Rights released their latest full length titled ""Illuminator"" through BlkHeart Group They continue to tour the country, promoting their latest album, and have played with many big label bands such as Asking Alexandria, Emmure, and Carnifex.

On March 30, 2011, AmpMagazine.com posted an interview[4] with Christian Lee and Handsome Rick.

On July 19, 2011 bassist Rick McDonald announced his departure from the group and had the following to say:

“The decision to part ways with NBR has not been an easy one. Throughout the last 4 years of touring I’ve made so many friends and have had experiences that will give me a lifetime of memories to share. I’ve decided to take my hobby in graphic design to the next level and go full time with it, leaving no room for NBR’s non-stop tour schedule. I still love everyone in the band (except Daniel =P) and will continue to help and support them all the way to the top.”

The band will be joined by fill-in bassist Ryan “Beard” Warrell (ex: To Something Beautiful, A Thorn For Every Heart etc.) for their upcoming Beautiful and Spineless Headline Tour and future dates until a permanent replacement is found

Since 2018 there have been two versions of the band, one with classic members [a=Tracii Guns] and [a=Phil Lewis] and one with classic members [a=Steve Riley] and [a=Kelly Nickels]. In 2021, the incarnation with Riley and Nickels finally changed its name to [a=Riley's L.A. Guns] because of a lawsuit concerning the use of the band name.

L.A. Guns is an American rock band whose music is frequently associated with the L.A. glam metal scene which grew up around the Sunset Strip in the 1980s, in particular the sleaze rock subgenre. Guns N' Roses, which once featured three of the original L.A. Guns members, was the most prominent exponent of this subgenre, generally preferring an anti-social image to elaborate make-up and costumes. 

L.A. Guns was formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner.  Over the next couple years it would evolve into what became the original version of [a=Guns n' Roses].  Tracii Guns would depart that band in 1985 and launch a new version of L.A. Guns.  Throughout the years, a large number of musicians would pass through some version of the band (of which, at times, there have been two) and no single member would be consistently present at all times.  The band's longest-serving and best-known members are Tracii Guns, drummer Steve Riley (who joined the band in 1987 and is the closest thing to a constant member, having been in the band from 1987 until 1992, and again from 1994 until 2016), and vocalist Phil Lewis.  The L.A. Guns name is owned by both Tracii Guns and Steve Riley and both musicians have led their own versions of the band. Riley and Lewis led L.A. Guns from 1999 until 2016 while Guns had a second version of the band from 2006 to 2012.  In 2016, Lewis and Guns formed a new version of the band, while in 2018 Riley announced he had his own version which included one-time bassist Kelly Nickels.  In 2020, Lewis and Guns filed a lawsuit against Riley over the trademark to the L.A. Guns name after which a settlement was reached in which Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis would retained ownership of the L.A. Guns name while Steve Riley would use the name ""Riley's L.A. Guns"".

Since their formation in 2009, they have self-released 2 EPs, titled ERRA and Andromeda. They went on to sign with Tragic Hero Records and release their debut album Impulse in 2011. Their second album, Augment, which was released 2 years later, reached number 1 on the ARIA heatseekers chart. It was the album that started to see them gain a lot more traction, and consequently was the only other record to be released under the label. After becoming more successful with Augment, ERRA signed with Sumerian Records and released their 3rd EP titled Moments of Clarity. This EP is the first release to not feature unclean vocalist and co-founding member, Garrison Lee. It is also the first release to not feature guitarist and co-founding member, Alan Rigdon. Shortly before the EP was released, ERRA recruited a replacement vocalist, Ian Eubanks to perform on the record and subsequently become the new frontman. After the release of Moments of Clarity - as early as December 2014, guitarist Jesse Cash began working on the next record, their vocalist also started to write lyrics for the album. In August 2015, Ian Eubanks decided to step down as unclean vocalist, stating that he struggled to perform his vocal parts during touring, and that he was no longer able to scream correctly. Consequently, ERRA once again was on the search for another unclean vocalist. The new vocalist JT Cavey (ex-vocalist for Texas in July) was announced through the release of the lead single Luminesce for their upcoming record Drift, released in April 2016. The band remained with Sumerian Records for their 2018 album Neon before signing with UNFD for the release of their self-titled album in 2021.

In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they put some self-produced recordings on MP3.com where they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez. Within a few months they had a deal with Immortal Records and released their EP ""Change is the Only Constant"".

In 2005, they released their first full length album, ""An Offer You Can't Refuse"". In 2006 they released their latest album, titled ""Prepare The Masses"".

The band was on both the 2005 and 2006 Vans Warped Tours (often on the smaller Ernie Ball Stage). They were also at the 2006 annual music festival held in the Phoenix area, ""Edgefest"".

The original album ""An Offer You Can't Refuse"" was composed of all band members except Dan Parker who was added to the line-up. A Change Of Pace also goes by the acronym ""ACOP"".

On June 1st, 2008, the band revealed on their MySpace blog how original singer, Torry Jasper would be replaced by their good friend [a=Micah Bentley]. The change brought about a new sound, as well as a new EP entitled ""Just No Better Way."" The news comes merely weeks before A Change of Pace heads out on their summer tour.

After delays, the band put forth their final LP in February 22, 2011, entitled ""Couldn't Be Worse"". It incorporated both of their older and newer sounds. Shortly thereafter, on March 13, it was announced on their Facebook page that after 10 years, they would disband, but not before playing a farewell show on April 22 at The Clubhouse in Tempe, Arizona.

A Change of Pace mixed their own brand of metal, punk and emo.

On September 24, 2007 the band announced they had broken up through their Myspace blog.

In 2008 the band played a few shows during the summer, but never fully reunited. In 2010, Jason, Adam, and Jeremy announced the formation of a new band called Astoria.

In January 2014, vocalist Adam Harrell announced that he and his wife were planning on adopting a child and that Chasing Victory would be reuniting for one show in the near future to help raise money for the adoption. The show was a success and the Harrells are now parents.

Based in Houma, Louisiana, the band was fronted by Dax Riggs (formerly of Acid Bath and Agents of Oblivion). Riggs conceived the name as a combination of both the early New York punk band Dead Boys, which he refers to as ""Deadboys"", and his former band Acid Bath's song ""Dead Girl"", as well as the David Lynch film The Elephant Man.

After disputes with an independent label over the distribution of their debut album ""If This Is Hell, Then I'm Lucky"", the band signed a three-record deal with Fat Possum.

 For the latter part of 2005, and most of 2006, they toured in support of their major label debut ""We Are Night Sky"" playing from bars and smaller venues to Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and Bonnaroo. 

In early 2006, Riggs recruited his former Agents of Oblivion bandmate, Alex Bergeron, to play bass on tour. Later that year, the band was primarily a duo of Riggs and Tessie Brunet. This line-up was often compared to The White Stripes in reviews, and their music is sometimes referred to as ""swamp rock."" By 2007, Brunet left the band and Riggs went on to a solo career.

Immediately the band finds a groundbreaking concept, getting inspiration both from the primitive side of Death Metal and the delicate and cold side of Electronica. The resulting sound is mostly made of guitars, drums and vocals, all passed through a digital chopper.
The name ""WHOURKR"" was born from a long research on the primitive human shout. This recurrent sound is the link and the key to the language used in the band's creations: in order to dig further into feelings, the singing doesn't bother with the weight of words. No significance, no translation: the voice is a howling instrument that creates an emotional language. Ecology is also a strong recurrent theme in WHOURKR's universe, and the first album of the band, ""Naät"" - derived from ""Nature"" - expresses that statement in its own way.
Consisting of [a=Igorrr] and [a=Mulk] since the departure of [a=-i snor] in 2011, WHOURKR finished its third studio album, ""4247 Snare Drums"", released on Ad Noiseam in 2012.

The band released its sixth full-length album, Delightfully Pleased, on August 10, 2010, on its own label, Modern Short Stories, and TDR Records.

1998-2002: early years

Punchline was formed in 1998 as a three-piece band consisting of Steve Soboslai (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Fafalios (bass guitar) PJ Caruso (drums). At the time, Fafalios was a senior in high school and Caruso and Soboslai were juniors. They played local shows and recorded their first album, How to Get Kicked Out of the Mall, a blend of pop- and ska-influenced punk. In later recordings, the ska influence became less prominent.

In 1999, the band self-produced and self-released the full-length Punchline album.

After being joined by Paul Menotiades (guitar, vocals), they recorded and co-produced Major Motion Picture with Billy Rossi for an August 2001 release. The four collaborated with Rossi again in 2002 on The Rewind EP. The EP's four tracks marked a transition into what became their signature pop-punk sound.
2003-2005: gaining popularity, Fueled by Ramen

In 2003, the band signed to Fueled by Ramen Records. The Rewind EP was remixed and remastered by Shelly Yakus for its Fueled by Ramen re-release. Early pressings included The Rewind Documentary DVD, a collection of footage of the band.

On the February 2004 album, Action, produced by Sean O'Keefe, Punchline set itself apart in the world of pop-punk music with bright three-part harmonies, unique melodies, catchy riffs and a strong rhythm section. Soboslai, Menotiades and Fafalios all sang on the disc and the first 10,000 pressings also included a DVD entitled The Action DVD.

During a tour, Menotiades left the band. The remaining members enlisted Greg Wood, a long-time friend, to fill in on guitar and vocals for the remaining shows. Wood, who also performed as a solo artist and was a member of the now defunct Connecticut band West Beverly, later joined as a permanent member, and played keyboards and piano in addition to guitar on Punchline's 2006 release 37 Everywhere.

In 2005, TDR Records (formerly known as To Define Records) released an Over It/Punchline split 7-inch vinyl with two exclusive songs. The Over It side has an acoustic version of ""Partner in Crime"", and the Punchline side has a previously unreleased acoustic version of ""Battlescars"".
2006: 37 Everywhere

37 Everywhere, produced by Shep Goodman and Kenny Gioia, was released by Fueled by Ramen Records on April 11, 2006. The album is dedicated to the life and times of John ""Beatz"" Holohan (1974–2005), the former drummer of Bayside.

The album's title refers to a theory suggesting that 37 is the most commonly seen number. The album's liner notes state: ""The number 37 is everywhere. It is in your daily routine and it will surprise you. Look for it and it will look for you."" Jason Sho Green, the artist/designer for the album, says the liner notes contain 37 instances of the number 37.

The album has guest vocals by Anthony Raneri of the New York band Bayside and Vinnie Caruana of I Am the Avalanche and formerly The Movie Life on ""Flashlight"", John Johansen of the defunct Stryder on ""Caller 10"", and Josh Bonner of the defunct Unsung Zeroes on ""Wars Will Always Happen"", as well as guest guitar work by Ryan Mendez of Yellowcard on ""Don't Try This at Home"".

On August 28, 2006, the band announced the departure of Wood.  Wood is said to be in good standing with the band and left to pursue other interests, specifically a solo career and teaching guitar.[4]

He was replaced by Jon Belan, a long-time Punchline friend and a former member of The Berlin Project and the lead singer of Gene the Werewolf. His first tour with Punchline was the ""Better Than Knowing Where You Are Tour"", headlined by Spitalfield, with support from Over It, Valencia, Peachcake and Boys Like Girls, in addition to Punchline.
2008: Just Say Yes and Modern Short Stories

Punchline's follow-up to 37 Everywhere was recorded in 2007 in two parts. Part 1 was recorded at Room Sound Studios in Tempe, Arizona, with the producer Jamie Woolford (formerly of The Stereo and now[when?] a member of the band Let Go). Part 2 was recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O'Keefe, who had produced Punchline's Action album.

On February 7, 2008, the band announced its departure from Fueled By Ramen in a brief statement:

    ""After many years on fueled by ramen its time for us to move on, after fulfilling the obligations of our contract with FBR we decided that we wanted to look for a new home. Armed with a new record that's already recorded we are excited to move on to something new. Thanks to the people at the FBR that supported us and helped us it means alot [sic]. onedoor [sic] closes and one opens.""

On July 11, 2008, Punchline created their independent label, Modern Short Stories, using the winnings ($25,000) from Heavy.com's Contraband Contest.

On ""37 day"" (March 7) 2008, Punchline announced in their AIM chatroom that the new album would be called Just Say Yes. It was released on September 16, 2008. A four-song bonus disc, Just Say Maybe, was included with the first 500 pre-ordered copies.
2009: more line-up changes and Night Lights

On January 25, 2009, Punchline announced the departure of its long-time drummer and original member Caruso. In a blog entry posted the same day, Soboslai told readers that the split was amicable and announced a temporary stand-in for already scheduled shows. He reassured fans that they planned on making music for a long time to come, and announced plans for a spring 2009 tour and DVD release, as well as a new album.

On May 3, 2009, Punchline premiered their new music video for ""Ghostie"" at 7:37 PM EST during an Absolutepunk.net chat.

On August 30, 2009, Punchline offered the new song ""Heart of Gold"" for free download, but those who paid $3 or more received 5 bonus songs, including rare Punchline tracks.

On September 12, 2009, during a hometown show in Pittsburgh on the AbsolutePunk.net Next Favorite Band Tour, Punchline asked the temporary drummer Pat Dee, formerly of the band Victory Lane, to become a permanent member. Punchline announced the departure of Belan later that week. Menotiades returned to replace Belan for the fall 2009 US tour and later rejoined the band.]

On December 1, 2009, Punchine released a digital collection of unreleased songs called Night Lights.
2010–2011: Delightfully Pleased

Beginning in May, Punchline went to Ohio to record with Jamie Woolford. Somewhere around this time, the former drummer, Dee, was let go from the band. Cory Muro, of Paul Menotiades' other band The Composure, also a Pittsburgh, PA band, is Pat's replacement.

A couple of weeks after their recording sessions were completed, Punchline released a song for fans of the television series Lost, a single rough mix track entitled ""Roller Coaster Smoke"". The track was released on the day of the Lost series finale. The official music video was released on July 23, 2010. It was directed by the Pittsburgh filmmaker and comedian Joe DeWitt.

On June 24, Punchline revealed that the new album would be called Delightfully Pleased and it would be released on August 10, by Modern Short Stories and TDR Records. The artwork was also released and the first song, ""21 Forever"", was released on their newly relaunched web site, PunchKids.com, on July 18. According to the band, this was their best album yet. Punchline's website allowed the downloading of Delightfully Pleased for any price. The name is refers to a crunkcore group, Brokencyde, that was involved in a fight with Muro at a show in Pittsburgh on April 25, 2011; Muro sustained minor injuries. Any money from the selling of these EPs was to gp towards Muro's hospital bills..
2012–present: So Nice to Meet You

On January 3, 2012, Punchline released a new EP exclusively on iTunes called So Nice To Meet You. The band had a social media push to get to No. 1 on the iTunes charts. On January 4, 2012, the album peaked at No. 7 on iTunes Overall charts and No. 1 in the Rock category. So Nice to Meet You also reached No. 4 on Billboard's Heatseekers charts, No. 29 Rock Albums, No. 16 Independent Albums and No. 23 Alternative Albums. Punchline appeared on the Fox reality television show Mobbed broadcast on April 1, 2012.

17479,58414,1332701,US,Bad Religion,New Maps of Hell,2007,38.45,16,['Album'],['Rock'],['Punk'],"Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

Valencia met by playing local shows together around the tri-state area in separate bands. George Ciukurescu and JD Perry grew up together; attending elementary school, high school, and their first year of college. They joined a band in 2001 called The Capgun Heroes with Brendan Walter and former members Sean Mundy and Ryan O'Hara. Shane Henderson sang in the band Attracted to Miss and Max played drums in The Emphasis. They formed the band that is known today as Valencia in 2004. The band is named after the wife of the protagonist, Valencia, in the book by Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. In 2005 Valencia signed to I Surrender Records after the label's owner, Midtown's drummer Rob Hitt, heard their demo tape.[2]

After playing the Warped Tour in 2005,[3] they released their first album, This Could Be a Possibility, in October 2005, which was re-released in September 2006. The album has received mixed reviews.[4][5][6][7] In 2006, the band was named SPIN Band of the Day and was a finalist for Band of the Year, but lost to Nightmare of You.[8] In May 2006 the band stopped touring because of the death of Shane's girlfriend.[9] In July 2006 Valencia traveled to Japan to play the Fuji Rock Festival. In 2007 the band toured with Boys Like Girls, The Audition and All Time Low in the U.S.[10] Valencia also toured with We the Kings, The Cab, Charlotte Sometimes, and Sing it Loud in April 2008.

His warm, textural synth pop and distant, dreamy vocals recall acts like Four Tet and Washed Out, though Maramag's roots are actually in metal and hardcore. Originally hailing from Hawaii, he relocated to Northern California and began his career as the drummer for Bay Area hardcore band Murder Practice. He left the band in 2009 to attend the University of California in Santa Cruz where he took an interest in electronic music and became enamored with artists like Aphex Twin and Modeselektor. While away at school he began recording under the alias Bye Bye Blackbird, eventually tweaking the name to Blackbird Blackbird after encountering another band with the same name. He released various singles before issuing his debut album, Summer Heart, in mid-2010. His blissed-out, sunny dream pop was well-received and he signed with San Francisco indie Lavish Habits to release his follow-up EP, 2012's Boracay Planet. Tours of the U.S. and Europe followed as he continued to evolve his live set-up and in 2013, it was announced he had signed to prominent San Francisco electronic label Om Records who released his second LP, Tangerine Sky, in June 2014. ~ Timothy Monger "

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Gustafson left before the recording of their first LP, Grimaldi was replaced by Jason Viebrooks, and the band went on to record two albums of groove-thrash metal in the early Machine Head vein with that line-up.
After the second album ""Nemesis"" was released in 1997, Viebrooks also left, and was replaced by Canadian bassist Stuart Carruthers for the recording of their third album ""Solidify"" (1999), before more or less naturally dissolving since the members were involved in other activities.

At this point, Lombardo is concentrating on the Fantomas project, and Sorychta has been busy producing bands like Tiamat, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering. 

The band never really disappeared though, and in 2004 they released a new album called ""Incorporated"" with Sorychta filling in on bass duties.

Started in the late eighties, the core of Broken Hope was formed in an effort to be one of the heaviest acts of the death metal genre. After two popular demos the quintet scored a deal with the then fledgling Grind Core/Red Light label and cut the debut Swamped in Gore. Greeted with enthusiastic response from the underground press the group took off on a small Canadian tour before playing at Milwaukee Metalfest VI, where representatives from Metal Blade Records spotted them.

Snatched up by Metal Blade a couple months later the band issued their sophomore disc in '93, The Bowels of Repugnance. Immediately garnering mainstream attention the quintet were praised by everyone from metal publications and tattoo mags to daily and regional papers like the Detroit Free Press, Illinois Entertainer and The Milwaukee Sentinel-who even dubbed the disc album of the year. The response was overwhelming and untypical of a heavy-handed act like Broken Hope whose brutal musical flair and lyrical content is only for the twisted.

""It has to do with perseverance and initiative,"" states guitarist Jeremy Wagner. ""We go out of our way to meet people and have them take a look at Broken Hope and they like what they see. Whether it's magazines or even our peers-they know who we are and we've gotten a lot of attention.""

The band's latest opus, Repulsive Conception, takes all the qualities that have made Broken Hope an immediate favorite to fans of the extreme but expands upon them. The new album is still as over-the-top as its predecessor but it's obvious to note the group's continued progression as developing songwriters and musicians, these enhancements only aid in expressing an even greater sense of professionalism. The addition of bassist Shaun Glass (formerly of-demo faves Sindrome), who came aboard just in time for the group's first national tour supporting Unleashed, has brought a slightly more technical side to the band, as evidenced by ""Dilation and Extraction"" and ""Pitbull Grin."" Each display a growth factor indicative of a band maturing in their field. The same cannot be said for many other acts in the genre who have either become stagnant or disregarded their roots, but these guys have persevered with a true disc of immortal preportions that will rattle any foundation and please any die-hard fanatic. At the same time. Repulsive Conception is not lust grinding extremities apparent by the addition of fluid guitar leads and catchier and longer songs that play upon harmonies, grind and doom parts to diversify the mix. Also included is a couple of instrumental segues, like the touching and emotional ""Essence of Human Pain,"" the group's first cover song, a brutal rendition of Twisted Sister's ""Captain Howdy,"" and a James Murphy (of Testament) guitar lead in ""Engorged with Impiety.""

But the band's third effort doesn't back down from the frightening lyrical content of prior releases as lyricist Jeremy Wagner delves even deeper into the horrific side of mankind and human abnormalities. As always, the words to ""Erotic Zoophilism,""""Chewed to Stubs"" and ""The Internal Twin"" make for interesting and, depending on your stability, disturbing reading.

But the disturbed is not the group's only ace, as Jeremy Wagner explains the concept behind ""For Only the Sick."" ""It was thought of by Joe (Ptacek-vocals) and it's our view of the death metal genre as a whole. Basically our message is this-there are a lot of journalists who dismiss death metal as noise and a lot of bands who deny their roots but when it comes to that we don't care what anyone thinks. Broken Hope is all about integrity and doing things our own way and since day one we've always proved the skeptics wrong. Broken Hope are here to stay""

The band, despite playing numerous live shows and releasing a slew of 7"" singles and three full length albums, never received much attention outside of their local fanbase. Even when they were together, Harvey Milk releases were notoriously hard to find. 

It was not until years after the band's demise that their singles, as well as all three full length albums, saw re-release through various labels, most notably Relapse Records. 

While Harvey Milk invariably draws comparisons to the [a=Melvins], due to their penchant for slow, heavy riffs, the band has touched upon such artists as [a=ZZ Top], [a=Led Zeppelin] and [a=Leonard Cohen] as influences in their music. They even went so far as to perform a live show consisting of nothing but [a=Hank Williams] covers. 

They are named after [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/334950-Harvey-Milk-2]Harvey Milk[/url], San Francisco, California's first openly gay city supervisor, who was murdered in 1978.

The Beginning (1999–2004)
No Bragging Rights was formed by vocalist, Mike Perez, when he was at the age of fifteen. They have released several demo recordings between 2001 and 2004. These recordings include ""Never Again Demo"" (2001), ""The Razor Apologies"" EP (2002), and ""Waking Angel Demo"" (2004). Ryan Sievers, Jose Mendoza, Anthony McCabe, Cody Henderson, Jamieson Stuart, and Chris Williams have all been credited for taking part in recording said releases. After several lineup changes they decided to pursue a more melodic hardcore and punk influenced sound.

2005–present
In 2005, No Bragging Rights began writing their first full length album titled ""Because You Believe in Something Beyond Them"" which was self-released in early 2006. This album was well received in the local music scene of Southern California and helped to establish the band outside of their hometown. Shortly after, “The Anatomy of a Martyr” EP was self-released in the summer of 2007, and brought No Bragging Rights to the national stage. This album was later re-released by Stand By Records.

Relentless ""do it yourself"" touring widened the band's fan base and attracted the attention of Pure Noise Records.The label re-released “The Anatomy of a Martyr” in 2008, and debuted the full length album ""The Consequences of Dreams"" in early 2009. That year No Bragging Rights played Taste of Chaos 2009 at The House of Blues, in San Diego, California, with Bring Me the Horizon and several other bands.

The following year they released two singles titled ""Passion Vs. Fashion"" and ""Unafraid to Burn"". ""Passion Vs. Fashion"" was released on the compilation album ""Vans 2010 Warped Tour Compilation."" ""Unafraid to Burn"" was released on the ""Atticus V"" compilation album In January 2011, No Bragging Rights released their latest full length titled ""Illuminator"" through BlkHeart Group They continue to tour the country, promoting their latest album, and have played with many big label bands such as Asking Alexandria, Emmure, and Carnifex.

On March 30, 2011, AmpMagazine.com posted an interview[4] with Christian Lee and Handsome Rick.

On July 19, 2011 bassist Rick McDonald announced his departure from the group and had the following to say:

“The decision to part ways with NBR has not been an easy one. Throughout the last 4 years of touring I’ve made so many friends and have had experiences that will give me a lifetime of memories to share. I’ve decided to take my hobby in graphic design to the next level and go full time with it, leaving no room for NBR’s non-stop tour schedule. I still love everyone in the band (except Daniel =P) and will continue to help and support them all the way to the top.”

The band will be joined by fill-in bassist Ryan “Beard” Warrell (ex: To Something Beautiful, A Thorn For Every Heart etc.) for their upcoming Beautiful and Spineless Headline Tour and future dates until a permanent replacement is found

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

Growing up on the quieter streets of New Jersey, but with New York City just moments away, childhood friends Corey Mastrangelo (guitar), Grant Mayer (guitar/keys) and Derek Broomhead (drums) would spend their summer days running from punk shows to late night raves, living a dichotomous life that wormed its way into their music.
Forever too dancey for their post-rock peers, but too post-rock for their dance music friends, Vasudeva’s career to date has been spent on a tightrope, the tension between walking that fine line adding angst to their soaring tracks. On their new record, ​Generator​, however, things are different. There is a sense of peace and assuredness to the New Jersey trio - no longer three kids in their early-twenties trying to find their way, it feels like Vasudeva have finally found what they were searching for.
A seamless and soaring record, ​Generator​ sees Vasudeva truly completely comfortable in their own skin for what feels like the first time. Written, produced and engineered by the band over the course of three months in early spring with the help of their long-time friend Kevin Dye, it is an entirely personal, (almost) chronological time capsule of the band as they entered their late twenties; growing and evolving as people, their music following suit. There is a sense of a new beginning, a new chapter. Using Logic Pro X for the first time, Mastrangelo, Mayer and Broomhead were, for the first time, able to tap into their wide, varied set of influences; exploring textures, using midi and incorporating drum machines and synth sounds that they first fell in love with through their affinity for dance music.
Harnessing electronic drums and voice notes recorded by Mayer when commuting in New York City, using real keys and reel-to-reel tape machines, ​Generator​ masterfully blends the analog and the electronic. “Stockmar” sees Vasudeva at their most R'n'B inspired, the slowest track on the album showcasing their growth, yet named after Broomhead’s childhood street where the band spent endless amounts of time growing up. Things change, but they are always rooted in the past.
The record is undeniably textured, layers of instruments complementing each other - nylon strings piggybacking off piano chords in “Drop”, programmed bass sitting atop Broomhead’s ever fidgeting drums in “Yamaha”. Everything has its place, but nothing feels regimented. It’s a free-flowing feeling, a structured emotion.
There is an overwhelming emotional quality to the music Vasudeva creates, and in ​Generator​ this voice is at its strongest. While there are still the walls of sound that featured in previous works ​Life In Cycles​ and ​No Clearance​ (the ending of opener “Breaks” threatens to blow any speaker it is played through, and the breakdown in “III” provides one of ​Generators​ loudest moments), there is a much clearer focus on production, on texture, on feeling in this record. The SP-404 created “Only On” leaves you swirling and shifting as the EQ pans back and forth, creating a truly unique listening experience, transporting you underwater.
Obsessed with this level of production, ​Generator​ speaks to the notion of technology pushing Vasudeva forward in their everyday lives. Idle or not, we must push on. There is an overwhelming sense of calm to ​Generator,​ the landscape created by Mastrangelo, Mayer and Broomhead enveloping and swaddling the listener, the music ebbing and flowing, creating worlds while saying nothing at all."

Later singer and guitarist Anne Marie Griffin joined the trio, then called Shallow. Nuby eventually left the group and was replaced by original Remy Zero drummer Louis Schefano, and after a name change to Verbena, the band released the EP Pilot Park on Merge. Nuby rejoined the band a year later in time for Verbena's debut full-length, Souls for Sale, which caught the ears of Dave Grohl, who agreed to produce the band's major-label debut, Into the Pink. Johnston left the band, making Verbena a trio once again, and it was as a trio that Verbena recorded their third album, 2003's La Musica Negra, before calling it quits. Bondy retreated to his Catskills home in Palenville in upstate New York and in time began writing songs again, emerging with a stripped-down indie folk sound. He recorded and mixed his debut solo album, American Hearts, at a barn near his home, releasing the project in 2007 on the Superphonic imprint.

During this time, the band did not play songs recorded by American Steel.

The band was re-launched in 2015 by some of the original members and has since released one studio album on Alternative Tentacles.

Tsunami Bomb was formed in 1998 by bassist Dominic Davi and singer Kristin McRory (both ex-[a=Headboard]), with keyboardist/backing vocalist Oobliette Sparks and guitarist Tim Chaddick. Gabe Lindeman played drums with them but could not commit to joining the band permanently. McRory and Chaddick left later that year, and by early 1999 the lineup was rounded out with the addition of singer Emily Whitehurst (aka Agent M) and guitarist Brian Plink (both ex-[a=Plinky]), with drummer Robert Read. Their first release was the 'B-Movie Queens' split EP with Plinky (Plinky's only release). Read was replaced by Lindeman, and this lineup released two EPs, 'Mayhem On The High Seas' (1999) and 'The Invasion From Within!' (2001). Plink left and was replaced by Mike Griffen, while Sparks left and was not replaced.

Tsunami Bomb signed to Kung Fu Records and released their first album, 'The Ultimate Escape' (2002). Davi was asked to leave the band (he went on to [a=Love Equals Death]) and was replaced by Matt McKenzie. This lineup released 'The Definitive Act' (2004). Griffen left and was replaced by Jay Northington, but Tsunami Bomb broke up in 2005. Whitehurst and McKenzie formed [a=The Action Design], while Lindeman and Northington formed [a=Nothington].

In 2015, Davi, Sparks, Lindeman, and Plink re-formed Tsunami Bomb with new singer Kate Jacobi to support the release of 'Trust No One', a compilation of their early EPs. Plink left in 2016, and Chris LaForge filled in until permanent guitarist Andy Pohl joined.

The band originally formed in 1989 as a solo project by Ixithra, alternately calling himself the Wicked Warlock Of Demonic Shadows or Lord Of The Sylvan Shadows. It would take three years before the cassette single [r=4725328] was released, and another two before their first full-length [m=318933].

During this time, constant changes in the lineup prompted Ixithra to temporarily abandon Demoncy and collaborate with former members of [a=Incantation] in the band [a=Profanatica], and to pursue other musical projects.

More low-fidelity recordings were eked out over the following years with lineup changes still a constant hindrance; two of these demo sessions were excerpted on the CD version of [r=2674286] in 1999.  That same year saw the release of [m=110792], a much-anticipated album that had originally been announced for release five years before. It received nearly universal acclaim and has attained classic status in some circles.

2003 saw the release of Demoncy's next full-length album, [r=1738145]; its slick production and more guttural vocal style were a distinct change from the raw and cold atmospheres of the earlier releases. This album led to tours across the US and Europe and appearances at several metal festivals. In 2004 the band was interviewed in the March issue of [i]Terrorizer[/i] magazine. This same year saw the release of a [url=http://www.discogs.com/Demoncy-Dark-Opus-Demoncy-Dark-Opus/release/1970444]split 7""[/url] with [a265883] from France.

The band entered the studio in 2005 to record the next album, but Ixithra was dissatisfied with the results and destroyed the recordings and fired his bandmates, leaving the status of Demoncy unclear. The band remained on hiatus until the release in 2012 of their fifth studio album, [m=514488].

17479,58431,392808,US,Bad Religion,The Process of Belief,2002,36.75,14,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Melodic Hardcore']","Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

In 1997, vocalist J.R. Hayes, guitarist Scott Hull and drummer John Evans formed the band Pig Destroyer (previously known as Cop Destroyer). As soon as the band formed, they started rehearsing. It didn't take long before the trio released a self-titled demo, and participated on a split with Orchid.

In 1998, Pig Destroyer toured the East Coast with other bands, including Drop Dead, Converge, Kid Dynamite, and Isis. Later that year they parted ways with drummer John Evans, who was then replaced by Brian Harvey. They also started to play more shows and released an album, ""Explosions in Ward 6,"" which brought them out of the underground to be known as one of the better Grindcore bands. The band continued to tour with bands like Discordance Axis, Phobia, Daybreak, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Disassociate. They also played at the 2000 March Metal Meltdown. 

In July 2000, the band signed with Relapse, and recorded a split 7"" with Isis. It sold out in a month. They later recorded and released ""38 Counts Of Battery,"" which included the remastered ""Explosions In Ward 6"" album, tracks from the Isis and Orchid splits and their demo from 1997. 

In 2001, they released ""Prowler in the yard"" which is the most extreme album they've made to date. The album got them even more fame, and the band is now of the leading Grindcore bands. 

In 2004 they released the compilation album, ""Painter of Dead Girls."""

[a=Bill Stevenson] soon hooked up with the duo as their drummer. At the end of 1977, Nolte became bass player for [a=The Last] and that group took precedent over David's commitment to the Descendents, so he was replaced by [a=Tony Lombardo], although David stuck around briefly to sing with the band. Their first release (as a trio at the time with Navetta and Lombardo handling vocals) was the [r=629008] 7"" in the style of melodic garage pop. After a six-month stretch with a female singer, [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/494063-Cecilia]Cecilia Loera[/url], they enlisted Stevenson and Navetta's classmate and a constant presence at Descendents' rehearsals, [a=Milo Aukerman], as a singer in late 1980, and reappeared as a 'proper' punk band, becoming a major player in the hardcore scene developing in Los Angeles at the time. 
Their debut album the following year, [r=630039], introduced an element of melody and sensitivity that set them apart from most other hardcore bands and Stevenson's songs in particular were to greatly influence the melodic punk-pop bands of the 1990s with themes of love and loss and alienation (themes far less common in the punk scene at the time). 
Following the album's release, Milo actually went to college to embark on an education that would take him as far as a doctorate in biochemistry. The band recruited [a=Ray Cooper (3)] to handle the vocals but at the same time Bill Stevenson became the drummer with fellow hardcore punks [a=Black Flag]. Although the plan was to play in both bands, Black Flag's rigorous touring scheduled proved to be too time-consuming. During this time, Descendents gigs were sporadic. There were a few gigs where the band appeared as a 5-piece, with both Navetta and Cooper playing guitar and Milo on vocals, and other shows by Lombardo and Cooper playing under the name Ascendents. The band did not record again until 1985, when they returned with the album [r=630066]. This was much more sensitive than ""Milo...,"" despite silly songs such as ""Pervert"" and ""No F.B"". 
The band's lineup changed around the time ""I Don't Want to Grow Up"". By the time of the recording, Navetta left the band to become a fisherman in Oregon and guitar duties were handled by Ray Cooper. Tony Lombardo left after the recording as touring was incompatible with his career as a postal carrier. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Doug+Carrion+(2)]Doug Carrion[/url] replaced Lombardo on bass. Lombardo has since stated that leaving the Descendents is the biggest regret he has in life. 
Their next album, [r=807910] (released in 1986) was not well received by critics, but fans liked it. It was a mix of more 'silly' songs (The last track on the album involving band members farting into microphones and laughing). 
After the Enjoy! tour, Ray Cooper got a job working in the emerging software scene and Doug Carrion left for other projects, eventually ending up in [a=Dag Nasty]. Stevenson invited [a=Stephen Egerton] and [a=Karl Alvarez] of Salt Lake City's [a=Massacre Guys] to replace them, and the now permanent line-up of the Descendents was in place. 
The group released the album [r=808983] in 1987, which, despite ""Van"", ""ALL-O-Gistics"" and the one-second ""ALL"", was the Descendents' most mature 1980's album, and featured emotional songs such as ""Coolidge"", ""Cameage"" and ""Clean Sheets"". 
With the release of ALL, the Descendents introduced to the world the driving concept behind their career's work, from which the album derives its title, the philosophy of ALL which they define quite conventionally as ""the total extent."" The idea of ALL as a concept beyond this conventional definition is one of endless self improvement. ""The total extent"" is an all-encompassing greatness, the pursuit of which is endless and impossible, but which is also the source of all real happiness. 
Milo left again in 1987 and the remaining Descendents reformed with singer [a=Dave Smalley] and reformed under the name [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/253329-ALL-2)]ALL[/url] and continued the legacy until 1996, when the Descendents reformed again with Milo Aukerman, now a full-time research biochemist, to record and tour in support of the album [r=429101]. 
In 2004 the band released the [r=813353] EP and their newest full length [r=528313], which is among their more emotional releases to date. Since then, the Descendents have sporadically performed live and have continued to work on new material when their schedules allow it. In 2002 and 2006, Stevenson, Lombardo, and Navetta got together to record the original songs the Desendents had written (predating ""Milo Goes To College"") and had never been recorded before (these recording were released as ""9th & Walnut"", a reference to the location of their old practice space, in the summer of 2021).  Navetta passed away in 2008 after a brief illness. In 2014, the band performed the entire ""Milo Goes To College"" album live with Tony Lombardo playing bass. Also, a documentary about the band, titled ""Filmage"" was released that same year."

In 2019, after more than two decades performing live, both nearby, and in some of the further reaches the planet, Pulley was honored to be inducted into the Ventura County Music Hall of Fame. 2020 promises to be a busy year for Pulley, as they head into their 25th anniversary with plans to play shows in North America and Europe, as well as to begin writing the follow-up to their latest full length, “No Change in the Weather.”

Vomitory was formed in Sweden in 1989 by Urban Gustafsson (guitar), Ronnie Olson (bass), and Tobias Gustafsson (drums). In 1990, they played their first gig in their hometown of Forshaga. After the gig, Ronnie decided to concentrate on vocals, so Bengt Sund joined the band on bass. Bengt's friend Ulf Dalegren joined the band on guitar in 1991, and the band was now ready to record some material.

In 1992, they released their first demo, which got them in contact with Witchhunt Records. This led to the release of the 7"" single, ""Moribund"". Shortly after, Bengt Sund was asked to leave, before being replaced by Thomas Bergqvist. Labels had begun showing interest, so the band recorded a five track promo CD in the hopes of getting a record deal, but nothing happened. In 1994, they released the demo ""Through Sepulchral Shadows"", and in 1995 they went on a small, but successful tour through Poland.

In 1996, they inked a deal with Fadeless Records and released their debut album, ""Raped in Their Own Blood"". Following the release of the album, both Thomas and Ronnie left the band and were replaced by Erik Rundqvist (bass) and Jussi Linna (vocals). ""Redemption"" followed in 1999, along with two European tours, a split 7"" EP with Murder Corporation, and the 10"" LP entitled ""Anniversary Picture Disc"". In 2000, the band signed to Metal Blade Records and released their third album, ""Revelation Nausea"". However, prior to recording the album, Jussi Linna had left the group. Thus, Erik Rundqvist handled both vocal and bass duties. 

""Blood Rapture"" was released in 2002, and was followed by their fifth album ""Primal Massacre"" in 2004. Guitarist Ulf Dalegren departed in 2005, with Peter Östlund stepping in shortly after. With this lineup, the band released ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize"" in 2007, ""Carnage Euphoria"" in 2009 and ""Opus Mortis VIII"" in 2011. 

In February 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding, playing their final show on December 27, 2013. In 2017, the band reunited for one show to honor an old friend. On March 23, 2018, Vomitory officially reunited to celebrate 30 years since the band's formation."

In 1997, Inearthed made a record deal with a small Belgian label to release their first album ""Something Wild"", but before the release the band was contacted by [l=Spinefarm Records], who also wanted to work with the band. Since they were already signed to another label, they had to fake a split-up and change the name to be able to release the album through Spinefarm. They chose ""Children of Bodom"" as the new name, inspired by the unsolved Lake Bodom murders, which took place in Finland in 1960 (teenagers camping next to the Lake Bodom were slaughtered by a maniac).

In November 2019 Raatikainen, Seppälä and Wirman announced that they were leaving the band, which also marked the end of Children of Bodom. Their final performance was in the Helsinki ice hall on December 15, 2019. Since he wouldn't be able to legally continue performing under the ""Children of Bodom"" banner, Alexi Laiho formed ""Bodom After Midnight"" in March 2020.

History
Stereomud released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. 
After extensive touring in support of that album, they went back into the studio, releasing Every Given Moment in April 2003. 

After participating in the Jagermeister Music Tour with P.E., Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, a mere 3 months after the release of Every Given Moment. 

They have performed a few select reunion shows since this, but for the most part, the band remains dormant to this day. Recently, it was rumored that Erik Rogers and Corey Lowery would reunite to reform the band, but the possibilities may not be true as they are focusing on their own bands. 

It is planned that a Stereomud DVD will be released at some point in the future. Erik Rogers changed band name to 'Dangerous New Machine' with a new lineup February 2009.

By 1973, Blackmore had steered [a170355] through a significant personnel change, with [a349634] and [a123906] being replaced by [a369909] and [a267270]. However, the new members were keen to add new musical styles and Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned ""Black Sheep of the Family"" with ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves"" turned down by the band. He decided to record the song with [a291557] instead, using Dio's band [a312415] as additional musicians. He enjoyed the results, and a full album, billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood.

After the release of three studio albums and an extensive world tour in 1977–78, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the ""sword and sorcery"" theme. Dio did not agree with this change and left Rainbow. Together with then new vocalist [a353675], Blackmore scored a hit single with “Since You Been Gone”. 

After more lineup changes and albums, Ritchie disbanded Rainbow in early 1984 to rejoin the reunited Deep Purple.

He resurrected Rainbow once again in early 1994, just after leaving Deep Purple for good. However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [a485494] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [a298038]. 

Against all expectations, Blackmore reformed Rainbow, with an all-new line-up, in late 2015. Blackmore announced that he would play ""all rock"" concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner of 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow', his first rock shows since 1997. The new Rainbow line-up was announced on November 6, 2015.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

From an impromptu jam, in early January 2009 at Jack White's Third Man studio in Nashville, the foursome found common ground and began writing, composing and laying down recordings 'on the fly'. The outcome was the band ""The Dead Weather "" and the album ""Horehound"", representing one of the brightest and most refreshing events in the musical history of 2009.

Alison 'VV' Mosshart, [ex ""Discount""] and still part of ""The Kills"" duo, provides lead vocals, backing guitar, percussion and her compositional style and delivery to many of the band's lyrics,

Dean Fertita, [ex ""Waxwings"" and ""Queens Of The Stone Age""] brings his multi-instrumentalist skills to bear on guitar, bass, organ, piano, synth and backing vocals.

Jack Lawrence, [ex ""Do-Whaters"" and 'floating' member of ""The Greenhornes"",  ""Blanche"" and ""The Raconteurs""] provides bass, guitar, drums and backing vocals.

Jack White, aka Jack White III, [""The White Stripes"" & ""The Raconteurs""] plays drums, provides lead and backing vocals, and plays his unmistakable style of lead guitar. Born ""John Gillis"", White began work in the upholstery trade, forming his first two-piece band ""Two Part Resin"", later renamed ""The Upholsterers"" after a career he would leave behind. He was then a member of ""Goober & The Peas"", Two-Star Tabernacle"" and ""The Henchmen"" before morphing into the persona of Jack White of ""The White Stripes"". After the success of ""The White Stripes"" as a 2-piece, with his wife Meg on drums [who's surname he adopted], White was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as 17th in their list of ""Greatest Guitarists Of All Time"".

""The Dead Weather"" band debut was a performance at ""Third Man"" HQ in Nashville on the 11th March 2009, followed by the single ""Hang You From The Heavens"" released from the ""Horehound"" album. The album was released on 13th July 2009 in Europe and the following day in North America, with 3 tracks made available as downloads for the ""Rock Band"" video game. The 3 tracks were ""Hang You From The Heavens"", ""No Hassle Night"" and ""Treat Me Like Your Mother"". In October 2009 the band released a further single ""I Cut Like A Buffalo"", accompanied by a cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band song ""A Child Of A Few Hours Is Burning To Death"". The single was also available bundled with 2 live tracks ""Bone House"" & ""Hang You From The Heavens"". During 2009 the band appeared on ""The Culture Show"" & ""Later, With Jools Holland"" on UK TV.

At the close of 2009 the band were close to completion of a follow-up album and will be touring the Pacific in March 2010, taking in Australia, New Zealand & Japan. By mid-January 2010 a documentary DVD will be available worldwide titled ""It Might Get Loud"" featuring the guitarists Jack White [""Fly Farm Blues""], Jimmy Page & The Edge."

This change was made because while for most of the bands' career all the members were Christian, by the time they split in 2013 they had some non-Christian members. These members felt alienated and it caused lots of issues within the band, so the band made the choice to keep their beliefs to themself and just be a non-Christian rock band.

After this, the band went through further line-up changes, and following the last live appearance in 2010, the status of the band became unclear. After many years of speculation regarding the band's status and possible third studio album, drummer Romain Goulon confirmed the band's breakup in 2016.

Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

The men of Sever Your Ties are not the typical Southern California product. Comprised of six best friends, Solid State Records’ most recent discovery is more than just a young band intent on proving themselves and finding success. Rather than aiming for the top of the charts, Sever Your Ties instead targets the hearts, minds and emotions of those who are willing to listen. This noble approach has brought the band immense success, a strong fan base, and the ability to spend their nights picking their fans up, spreading their message and living their dreams.

Choosing to stay close to home for the recording of their Solid State debut Safety in the Sea afforded the band the necessary time to craft their ideas, melodic themes and lyrical jaunts into full-blown songs and statements. Safety in the Sea, produced by long-time friend and fellow SoCal native Jeff Schneeweis (Number One Gun), finds the band digging deeper into their influences to present a cohesive, emotional and sincere record that all six members always knew they could, and would write."

However, the worlds didn’t meet just yet. Aaron first discovered electronic music while living in New York City, making ambient, drum & bass, and jungle music at local venues. Eventually he moved to Berlin and started playing shows all over Europe, coming up from squats to clubs to festivals, building a devoted following in the process. He released a host of records to critical acclaim, and has since toured the world several times over.

Drumcorps is the merging of Aaron's roots in heavy guitar music with concise songwriting and a broad electronic sound palette. In 2007 the debut album received an award of distinction from Austria's Prix Ars Electronica, for its hyper-melding of American hardcore punk and electronic music. Recently Aaron has been based in Amsterdam, working in genres such as glitch, chiptune, drum & bass, jungle, and electronic punk rock."

Paul Stanley is an American hard rock guitarist, singer, musician, painter and songwriter best known for being the rhythm guitarist and primary lead vocalist of the rock band Kiss. He is the writer or co-writer of many of the band's highest-charting hits.

Before Kiss, Paul Stanley was in a local band, Rainbow (not to be confused with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow) and was also a member of Uncle Joe and Post War Baby Boom (with bassist [a1204385]). Through a mutual friend of Gene Simmons', Stanley joined Simmons' band [a=Wicked Lester (2)] in the early 1970s. The band recorded an album in 1972, but as of 2010 it has not been officially released (although songs from the album appeared on Kiss's 2001 box set). Wicked Lester soon fell apart and Stanley and Simmons placed ads for a drummer and a guitarist in various New York papers. This resulted in Peter Criss and Ace Frehley joining the group, and they named themselves Kiss. Kiss released their self-titled debut in February 1974.

Stanley's persona in Kiss was ""The Starchild"" utilizing one star over his right eye. For a brief time, Stanley changed his make-up character to ""The Bandit"", with a ""Lone Ranger"" style mask design make-up pattern. This make-up design would only be used during a few mid-1973 shows, soon to be replaced by the now famous ""The Starchild"" make-up design and persona. In his book Sex Money Kiss, Gene Simmons admits that Stanley was the driving force for Kiss during the makeup-free 1980s, while Simmons was feeling lost without his demon makeup and was distanced from the band while attempting to launch a film career.

In 1999, Stanley starred in a Toronto production of The Phantom of the Opera, in which he played the role of The Phantom. He appeared in the musical from May 25 to August 1, and again that year from September 30 to October 31, 1999.

Stanley made his debut as a painter in 2005, exhibiting and selling original works of art.

Stanley collaborated with Boston-based power pop group Click Five on their hit single, ""Angel To You (Devil To Me)""

Agnostic Front's frontman Roger Miret would let his younger brother, Freddy ""Madball"" Cricien take the microphone on lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows and that is where it started.
Madball's first few gigs consisted of un-used Agnostic Front songs.

Upon founding the band consisted of 
Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and vocalist Freddy Cricien.
After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, would join the band. 

One year later Roger Miret left the band, and was replaced by bassist Hoya Roc — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band to play with.
The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown.

1995 saw the band participating in the N.Y.H.C. Documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29th, 1995 at the now defunct ""Coney Island High"". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year.

The band briefly broke up from early 2001 until late 2002. This lineup of Freddy Cricien, Hoya Roc, Mitts (ex-Skarhead), and Rigg Ross (ex-Hatebreed) began touring and recording at the end of 2002.  In 2004 they released their first output after they broke-up the ""N.Y.H.C. EP"" via small diy labels Thorp (USA) & GSR Records (Europe). After that the band released their comeback album ""Legacy"" via Ferret Records (USA) and Roadrunner (Europe) in 2005 and it was a great success. Multiple tours (especially Europe) followed."

All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

Agnostic Front's frontman Roger Miret would let his younger brother, Freddy ""Madball"" Cricien take the microphone on lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows and that is where it started.
Madball's first few gigs consisted of un-used Agnostic Front songs.

Upon founding the band consisted of 
Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and vocalist Freddy Cricien.
After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, would join the band. 

One year later Roger Miret left the band, and was replaced by bassist Hoya Roc — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band to play with.
The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown.

1995 saw the band participating in the N.Y.H.C. Documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29th, 1995 at the now defunct ""Coney Island High"". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year.

The band briefly broke up from early 2001 until late 2002. This lineup of Freddy Cricien, Hoya Roc, Mitts (ex-Skarhead), and Rigg Ross (ex-Hatebreed) began touring and recording at the end of 2002.  In 2004 they released their first output after they broke-up the ""N.Y.H.C. EP"" via small diy labels Thorp (USA) & GSR Records (Europe). After that the band released their comeback album ""Legacy"" via Ferret Records (USA) and Roadrunner (Europe) in 2005 and it was a great success. Multiple tours (especially Europe) followed."

Vomitory was formed in Sweden in 1989 by Urban Gustafsson (guitar), Ronnie Olson (bass), and Tobias Gustafsson (drums). In 1990, they played their first gig in their hometown of Forshaga. After the gig, Ronnie decided to concentrate on vocals, so Bengt Sund joined the band on bass. Bengt's friend Ulf Dalegren joined the band on guitar in 1991, and the band was now ready to record some material.

In 1992, they released their first demo, which got them in contact with Witchhunt Records. This led to the release of the 7"" single, ""Moribund"". Shortly after, Bengt Sund was asked to leave, before being replaced by Thomas Bergqvist. Labels had begun showing interest, so the band recorded a five track promo CD in the hopes of getting a record deal, but nothing happened. In 1994, they released the demo ""Through Sepulchral Shadows"", and in 1995 they went on a small, but successful tour through Poland.

In 1996, they inked a deal with Fadeless Records and released their debut album, ""Raped in Their Own Blood"". Following the release of the album, both Thomas and Ronnie left the band and were replaced by Erik Rundqvist (bass) and Jussi Linna (vocals). ""Redemption"" followed in 1999, along with two European tours, a split 7"" EP with Murder Corporation, and the 10"" LP entitled ""Anniversary Picture Disc"". In 2000, the band signed to Metal Blade Records and released their third album, ""Revelation Nausea"". However, prior to recording the album, Jussi Linna had left the group. Thus, Erik Rundqvist handled both vocal and bass duties. 

""Blood Rapture"" was released in 2002, and was followed by their fifth album ""Primal Massacre"" in 2004. Guitarist Ulf Dalegren departed in 2005, with Peter Östlund stepping in shortly after. With this lineup, the band released ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize"" in 2007, ""Carnage Euphoria"" in 2009 and ""Opus Mortis VIII"" in 2011. 

In February 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding, playing their final show on December 27, 2013. In 2017, the band reunited for one show to honor an old friend. On March 23, 2018, Vomitory officially reunited to celebrate 30 years since the band's formation."

Vomitory was formed in Sweden in 1989 by Urban Gustafsson (guitar), Ronnie Olson (bass), and Tobias Gustafsson (drums). In 1990, they played their first gig in their hometown of Forshaga. After the gig, Ronnie decided to concentrate on vocals, so Bengt Sund joined the band on bass. Bengt's friend Ulf Dalegren joined the band on guitar in 1991, and the band was now ready to record some material.

In 1992, they released their first demo, which got them in contact with Witchhunt Records. This led to the release of the 7"" single, ""Moribund"". Shortly after, Bengt Sund was asked to leave, before being replaced by Thomas Bergqvist. Labels had begun showing interest, so the band recorded a five track promo CD in the hopes of getting a record deal, but nothing happened. In 1994, they released the demo ""Through Sepulchral Shadows"", and in 1995 they went on a small, but successful tour through Poland.

In 1996, they inked a deal with Fadeless Records and released their debut album, ""Raped in Their Own Blood"". Following the release of the album, both Thomas and Ronnie left the band and were replaced by Erik Rundqvist (bass) and Jussi Linna (vocals). ""Redemption"" followed in 1999, along with two European tours, a split 7"" EP with Murder Corporation, and the 10"" LP entitled ""Anniversary Picture Disc"". In 2000, the band signed to Metal Blade Records and released their third album, ""Revelation Nausea"". However, prior to recording the album, Jussi Linna had left the group. Thus, Erik Rundqvist handled both vocal and bass duties. 

""Blood Rapture"" was released in 2002, and was followed by their fifth album ""Primal Massacre"" in 2004. Guitarist Ulf Dalegren departed in 2005, with Peter Östlund stepping in shortly after. With this lineup, the band released ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize"" in 2007, ""Carnage Euphoria"" in 2009 and ""Opus Mortis VIII"" in 2011. 

In February 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding, playing their final show on December 27, 2013. In 2017, the band reunited for one show to honor an old friend. On March 23, 2018, Vomitory officially reunited to celebrate 30 years since the band's formation."

In 2005 Valencia signed to I Surrender Records after the label's owner, Midtown's drummer Rob Hitt, heard their demo tape.[2]

After playing the Warped Tour in 2005,[3] they released their first album, This Could Be a Possibility, in October 2005, which was re-released in September 2006.

In 1993, Brant left Kyuss and moved to Humboldt to flip pizzas and play soccer. Too much rain moved him back to his natural habitat where he started an independent record label, [l=El Camino Records (3)] which then evolved in [l=Duna] Records (now defunct) and then in [l=Low Desert Punk] Records; played drums in hardcore punk band [a=De-Con]; and played guitar with desert legend [a=Mario Lalli] in [a=Fatso Jetson]. In 1996, Bjork hooked up again with Homme, to begin [a=The Desert Sessions] saga and work on what became [a=Queens Of The Stone Age]. However, Brant decided to take the road less traveled and rock with his surf buddies [a=Fu Manchu], an adventure which took him into the studio for five records and around the world in four years. After few solo albums in the 00's he joined a resurrected version of Kyuss under the new monicker Kyuss Lives! (without Josh Homme). Kyuss Lives! then changed name in [a=Vista Chino] and released an album before going to hiatus. In 2014 Brant formed a new band [a=Brant Bjork And The Low Desert Punk Band]. In 2016 he released a new album, Tao Of The Devil under his name only.

They were initially founded in 1984 under then name Oblivion, which was soon changed to R.A.V.A.G.E. (Raging Atheist Vowing A Gory End).  The band issued several demos under this name before shortening their moniker to just Atheist.  The band released their first album, ""Piece Of Time"" in 1989.  The line-up was Kelly Shaefer (vocals, guitar), Rand Burkey (guitar), Roger Patterson (bass), and Steve Flynn (drums).  In 1991, as the band was preparing their follow up, Patterson was killed in a car accident.  He was replaced by Tony Choy ([a=Pestilence]).  Atheist broke up the following year but in 1993, Kelly Shaefer put together a new line-up featuring Choy, Jason Greenbaum (drums), and Frank Emmi (guitar).  Growing problems with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome forced Shaefer to limit his guitar playing to just rhythm guitar.  Just prior to recording their new album, Rand Burkey rejoined the group.  The album, ""Elements"" toned down the metal influences and increased the jazz and Latin elements.  Atheist split again after its release.

In 2005, Relapse Records reissued Atheist's 3 albums with bonus tracks that included demos and live tracks.  In 2006, it was announced the Atheist was reuniting with Shaefer, Flynn, Choy, and Burkey along with guitarist Sonny Carson, as tendonitis and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome prevented Shaefer from playing guitar.  However, personal legal problems forced Burkey to exit and he was replaced by Chris Baker.  In 2010, it was announced the Choy had left the band for other projects.  Later that year, Shaefer, Flynn, Baker and guitarist Jonathan Thompson recorded the album ""Jupiter"", with Thompson recording all the bass parts."

And with a formula consisting of: rhythmically complex music, an amazing and entertaining live show, hard work, determination, and the maintaining of good attitudes towards everyone they come in contact with, Calico System has emerged as one of the leading bands not only in St. Louis, but also throughout the Midwest region.

Blessed with a vocalist who can sing as well as draw from his various other influences, Calico System’s frontman, Mark Owens, displays a variety of diverse components with the strength of his abilities lying in his beautiful harmonies. From melodic singing & hardcore screams to System of a Downesque rants, Owens relays his lessons learned form life in a unique, intelligent, and emotionally charged way. Following Mark to complete the equation known as Calico System are Guitarists-Geoff Cardin and Shawn Keith, Bassist-Justin Haltmar, and Drummer-Erik Ramsier. 

Having influences from such groups as Hum, Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Bjork, Sunny Day Real Estate, Glassjaw, Taproot, System of a Down, Cindy Lopper, MC Hammer, and Milli Vanilli (just joking about the last three) Calico System has created a sound that is definitely worthy of being called “all their own,” and has gained them opening spots for such bands as Hatebreed, Finger Eleven, Poison the Well, Crowbar, PrimeSTH, UPO, Living Sacrifice, God Forbid, and Dog Fashion Disco.

The first and only demo was called ""Ungentle Exhumation"" and was released in the following year. In 1994 their first full-length was released, ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"", and it gained them succes and a good reputation in the underground. In 1996 they released the classic ""None So Vile"" which was a huge succes and surpassed other bands in terms of brutality. Sadly, Lord Worm left the band after the release. Michael DiSalvo (Infestation) later joined the band and he was the perfect replacement. After an impressive live show at the Milwaukee Metal Festival the band were signed to Century Media Records. 

With a new frontman and a record deal, the band recorded ""Whisper Supremacy"" which was released in 1998. They went on tours around the world and sales were up to 50,000 copies. Cryptopsy was becoming bigger and bigger and more live shows where played including the Dynamo Festival in Holland and several shows in Japan. 

After a wealth of tours the band returned to the studio and recorded ""And Then You'll Beg"" which was released in 2000. In August 2001, vocalist Michael DiSalvo was replaced by Martin Lacroix. In 2003 they released the live album, ""None So Live"", which was the last to feature Martin Lacroix as he left the band shortly after. His replacement was none other than the original vocalist, Lord Worm. In 2005, they recorded a new studio album entitled ""Once Was Not"". 

In 2008, ""The Unspoken King"" album marks the debut of Matt McGachy as well as the first and only appearance on a Cryptopsy album by Maggie Durand, as well as the band's departure from the death metal genre. The band instead perform deathcore on this album. 

After being on a record label for their entire career, Cryptopsy decided to go independent in 2012. Cryptopsy released independently the eponymous album on September 14, 2012. The album marked a return to their technical death metal sound.

In 2015, rather than a full album, Cryptopsy released the first instalment (Tome 1) of a series of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering. The band has said that The Book of Suffering Tome 1 is some of the most brutal, dark and technical music they have ever created."

Jon recalls, “We called it the Dungeon. It was a hot and muggy cement basement with no windows. Basically, a hole in the earth created for slaughtering animals...but ‘metal’ bands got to jam down there – go figure!!” The two bands found themselves frequenting the other’s rehearsals and developed a mutual respect for their music. Greg and Mike wanted Neck to break out of the conventional and over saturated hardcore scene by being different. Greg recollects, “We all really dug what Faith No More did, so we tried to emulate that, except heavier and more progressive.” With three releases on various labels and five years of shows up and down the east coast, Neck had established themselves as one of Long Island’s most unique and brutal acts. On the other side of the Dungeon, bassist Jon and drummer Elliot were a part of Spooge, a more technical and stylistic band. Influences of Zappa and early Mr. Bungle can be heard throughout their complex and at most times hilarious epics.

Their early demo material was released via the small Here We Are Records label, and led indirectly to a contract with the Canadian independent Goodfellow Records. The Finding Solace In Dissension EP and the album And They Slept followed at the start of the new millennium. Both releases met with strong acclaim on the US hardcore scene, with comparisons made to the knotty alternative rock of pioneering bands such as At The Drive-In and Glassjaw.

Born was replaced by Juan Pereda at the end of 2001 and Baird by Erik Bensberg the following summer. Despite a formidable live reputation and a growing cult following, Taken chose to disband in 2004 after a series of emotional farewell concerts and the release of Between Two Unseens. Harkin went on to form Mikoto and Beard joined post-hardcore unit Circa Survive. 14 years later, in 2018, Taken came back with a new release consisting in an 5 track EP entitled With Regards To, via L.A based label Other People Records."

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

Atlanta-based post-hardcore/alternative metal act the Chariot is a showcase for singer Josh Scogin. Formerly frontman for the popular Christian nu-metallers Norma Jean (originally known as Luti-Kriss, before Dirty South rapper Ludacris eclipsed their limited popularity), Scogin left Norma Jean for undisclosed personal reasons in 2003, following the release of their second album. Largely dispensing with the rap-rock and nu-metal aspects of Norma Jean in favor of a punkier metalcore direction, Scogin almost immediately formed the Chariot with members of other area metal and CCM groups.

The original lineup of the Chariot consisted of Scogin, singer and guitarist Keller Harbin, guitarist Tony Medina, bassist Joshua Beiser, and drummer Jeff Carter. Signing to the popular Christian indie rock label Solid State Records in 2004, the band debuted later that year with the almost operatically titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding. Following the subsequent release of a live DVD, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chariot, Medina and Carter left the band; new drummer Mark Nicks debuted on the 2005 EP Unsung, but was replaced by Jake Ryan before sessions began for the band's second full-length, The Fiancee. After the album was recorded, Beiser and Harbin left the Chariot (Harbin joining Every Time I Die) and were replaced by Jon Terry and Dan Eaton in time for an extensive North American package tour with other bands from the Solid State Records roster.

Delayed by the rapid changeover in band personnel, The Fiancee eventually surfaced in early April 2007 with new bassist Jon ""KC Wolf"" Kindler on board. Terry and Eaton's time in the band would be short-lived, with the pair being replaced by Bryan Russell Taylor and Stephen Harrison before the release of the band's 2010 album, Long Live. Taylor would be the next casualty of the Chariot's revolving-door lineup, with replacement Brandon Henderson coming on board in 2011. Further lineup changes found Kindler leaving the band to attend college with Henderson and Harrison taking over bass duties in the studio. The Chariot's fifth album, One Wing, featuring production from the band's longtime engineer/producer Matt Gordon, arrived in 2012"

Phil Vane (vocals), Dean Jones (vocals), Pete Hurley (guitar), Jerry Clay (bass) and 'Pig Killer' (drums) formed Extreme Noise Terror back in 1985 in Ipswich, England as a heavy Hardcore Punk band.
This lineup released the Radioactive Earslaughter split album with Chaos UK
Jerry Clay was soon replaced by Mark Gardener (Sarcasm)
Pig Killer quit and was replaced by Mick Harris (Napalm Death)
This lineup recorded the 'Holocaust In Your Head' album. however this version was never released as internal disharmony lead to the eviction of Mick Harris - Replaced by Stick (Doom) - The album was re-recorded with the new lineup and released on vinyl
Mark Gardener was evicted and replaced by Pete Nash (Doom)
Phil Vane was next to quit and was replaced by Spit
Spit's stay was short and he was replaced by the returning Vane
Pete Nash quit and was replaced by Mark Bailey (Filthkick)
The lineup of Jones/Vane/Hurley/Stick/Bailey proved the most stable in the bands volatile history - Recordings by this lineup included Peel Session No3, Phonophobia, a re-recording of 'Holocaust In Your Head' (Released on CD) plus various tracks recorded for compilation albums

The collaboration with KLF was the beginning of the end for ENT as a Punk band - During this period ENT stopped working on their own material - When KLF 'retired' ENT had no money to continue and no new material to record - This lead to the band merging with Dean Jones side project Raw Noise - Stick was replaced by Raw Noise drummer (and original ENT drummer) Pig Killer, Ali Firouzbakht joined on lead guitar.

The style of ENT's music began to change as they attempted to write material which would make money instead of the crust/grind style they were known for - The new material was slower and borrowed heavilly from bands such as GISM, Ministry and Pitch Shifter - The 'Witness To The Persecution' tour of Germany previewed this new style for the first time and was not well received by the fans
The new sound combined with internal disharmonies lead to the departures firstly of Bailey (replaced by Lee Barrett of Disgust) and later of Hurley (who was not replaced)

From this point on ENT became a death metal band bearing little resemblence either in style or lineup to it's roots in hardcore punk as members of Cradle of Filth and Napalm Death joined with Extreme Noise Terror to create the reborn group that would release ""Damage 381"" in 1997. 

From mid 2010's the band started to release vinyl closer to what fans consider their true sound, with releases such as the Hatred and the Filth EP,  a split EP with Japanese band Slang, and a full length release, that sounded closest to their original sound for a long time.

Atlanta-based post-hardcore/alternative metal act the Chariot is a showcase for singer Josh Scogin. Formerly frontman for the popular Christian nu-metallers Norma Jean (originally known as Luti-Kriss, before Dirty South rapper Ludacris eclipsed their limited popularity), Scogin left Norma Jean for undisclosed personal reasons in 2003, following the release of their second album. Largely dispensing with the rap-rock and nu-metal aspects of Norma Jean in favor of a punkier metalcore direction, Scogin almost immediately formed the Chariot with members of other area metal and CCM groups.

The original lineup of the Chariot consisted of Scogin, singer and guitarist Keller Harbin, guitarist Tony Medina, bassist Joshua Beiser, and drummer Jeff Carter. Signing to the popular Christian indie rock label Solid State Records in 2004, the band debuted later that year with the almost operatically titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding. Following the subsequent release of a live DVD, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chariot, Medina and Carter left the band; new drummer Mark Nicks debuted on the 2005 EP Unsung, but was replaced by Jake Ryan before sessions began for the band's second full-length, The Fiancee. After the album was recorded, Beiser and Harbin left the Chariot (Harbin joining Every Time I Die) and were replaced by Jon Terry and Dan Eaton in time for an extensive North American package tour with other bands from the Solid State Records roster.

Delayed by the rapid changeover in band personnel, The Fiancee eventually surfaced in early April 2007 with new bassist Jon ""KC Wolf"" Kindler on board. Terry and Eaton's time in the band would be short-lived, with the pair being replaced by Bryan Russell Taylor and Stephen Harrison before the release of the band's 2010 album, Long Live. Taylor would be the next casualty of the Chariot's revolving-door lineup, with replacement Brandon Henderson coming on board in 2011. Further lineup changes found Kindler leaving the band to attend college with Henderson and Harrison taking over bass duties in the studio. The Chariot's fifth album, One Wing, featuring production from the band's longtime engineer/producer Matt Gordon, arrived in 2012"

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, ending the band.
They have been categorized as grindcore, noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation (at least via their recordings) for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a ""cock rock"" album entitled Fuckin' A. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome was released digitally in 2010."

Jared was drawn to the fold by way of Internet courtship. 

The band is often considered noise rock, but besides having some slight elements of the genre, they don’t fit the sound of other, current bands included in the noise rock scene, due to them mixing such genres as dance and electronica.

HEALTH plan to tour continuously doing what they love and do best, make eccentric and original music.

Born in Paris, France, the son of Jewish Russian parents. He had well known children : a daughter, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Charlotte+Gainsbourg]Charlotte[/url], with [a=Jane Birkin]; and a son, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lulu+Gainsbourg]Lucien Gainsbourg[/url] (aka Lulu), with his last partner, [a=Bambou]. Two other children are non-mediatics  : Natacha (born 8 August 1964) and Paul (born 13 April 1968) with Françoise Antoinette Pancrazzi.
 
Serge Gainsbourg (born Lucien Ginsburg), wanted to be a painter but earned his living as a piano player in bars. He was tapped to join the cast of the musical 'Milord L'Arsouille', where he reluctantly assumed a singing role; self-conscious about his rather homely appearance, Gainsbourg initially wanted only to carve out a niche as a composer and producer, never as a performer.

His early influence was [a=Boris Vian]. Gainsbourg wanted to free himself from what he considered old-fashioned 'chanson' and explore other musical grounds, influenced especially by British and American pop. He also wrote soundtracks for more than 40 movies and directed himself in four movies: 'Je t'aime... moi non plus' (10 years censored*), 'Equateur', 'Charlotte For Ever' and 'Stan The Flasher'.

*  [r=541072] (1969) the song, featured simulated sounds of female orgasm. Originally recorded with [a=Brigitte Bardot], it was instead released with a future girlfriend [a=Jane Birkin] as Brigitte Bardot backed out. The song was censored in many countries and in France even the toned-down version was suppressed. The Vatican made a public statement citing the song as offensive. Its notoriety led to it reaching no. 1 in the UK chart.

A frequent interpreter of Gainsbourg's songs was British torch singer [a=Petula Clark], whose success in France was propelled by her recordings of his tunes but the first English-language version of a Gainsbourg song was [a=Dionne Warwick]'s 1965 version of 'Mamadou'.

Concept album [r=408587] produced and arranged by [a=Jean-Claude Vannier] was somewhat based on Nabokov's novel Lolita. It has proven influential with artists such as [a=Air], [a=David Holmes] who covered a track and [a=Beck].

in 1978 with [a=Robbie Shakespeare], [a=Sly Dunbar] and [a=Rita Marley] he made a Reggae version of the French national anthem ""La Marseillaise"". His version earned him death threats from right wing veterans of the Algerian War of Independence (OAS). Gainsbourg was able to reply to his critics that his version was in fact closer to the original as the manuscript clearly shows the words ""Aux armes et cætera..."" for the chorus."

Beherit (meaning Satan in Syriac) is one of the first Finnish black/death metal bands and their 1993 debut album ’Drawing Down The Moon’ is a staple of Finnish extreme metal. Soon after the album was released Beherit became Marko Laiho’s solo project and his interest in electronic music also steered Beherit’s musical direction away from metal and the following albums were experimental electronic/ambient music. After 1996’s ‘Electric Doom Synthesis’ Beherit went on a long hiatus.	

In 2007 Laiho and original drummer Pirinen re-activated the band and their comeback album ‘Engram’ was released in 2009. This also saw the band returning to black metal form with a full band line-up. The latest release Bardo Exist was again a solo effort and saw Laiho exploring the ambient/electronic side of Beherit again.

The band recorded a full-length CD album in the summer of 1999 titled ""V. O. V."" and began playing shows. In the summer of 2000, the band changed name to Mare and recorded their second release, a self-titled EP, ""Mare"", released on CD-Rs. But the band was soon put on hold while members pursued other projects; Tyler Semrick-Palmateer went to The End (4) while Paul Dunning went to The Abandoned Hearts Club.

Mare reformed in 2002, after Tyler quit The End, with a slightly altered line-up, and eventually recorded their third release, another self-titled CD-R EP in the summer of 2003. But the band was unhappy with the recording of this third release and they decided to completely re-recorded it at a different studio. The re-recorded version served as the band's fourth release, ""Mare"", put out by the band on CD-Rs in the fall of 2003. It was this fourth release which was eventually re-released by Hydra Head Records on CD an entire year later in October 2004, ""Mare"", and gained the band notability. This same release was also re-released by Translation Loss Records on vinyl and Daymare Recordings on CD in Japan.

Mare covered Melvins's ""Nightgoat"" for the tribute album ""We Reach: The Music Of The Melvins"" in 2005. Several pre-production recording sessions took place in 2006 for Mare's planned fifth release (and second release on Hydra Head Records). The release was nearly completed; nevertheless, the band felt tremendous pressure to follow-up with better material and ultimately disbanded in 2007 citing ""lack of motivation to write and record more material for the project.” The recordings of this unfinished album quickly found their way to file-sharing programs but the band (not wanting to contradict its reason for breaking up) later dismissed them as mere demos.

The band has since reunited several times; first in 2009 for a single show in Ontario; then in 2012 for three shows in Ontario; again in 2015 for a Canadian/American mini-tour; in 2016 for a single Canadian show and a European tour that got cancelled; and most recently in 2017 for a single Canadian show followed by a full European tour."

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

Octaves compiled enough material to fill their first LP, Greener Pastures, which would they would record the summer of 2009. With a few rough ideas in the bucket for their next record, the struggle ended with the addition of Andrew 'Roo' Russell to the band in early 2012. Whether it was his unique style of guitar playing, or just the fresh flesh in the room, things were clicking again and before long the reformed Octaves was ready to record their second full-length. And so they did that in Summer 2012.

Deciding to keep it close to home this time, Octaves selected old friend and mildly renowned engineer Kevin Bernsten to work with at his Baltimore based Developing Nations Studios. Throughout the recording process, the guys were sending out every ounce of new recorded material they had to record labels around the country in effort to gain some financial backing for what the stone-broke 5-piece had decided would be their first vinyl release. Octaves was then approached by Bridge Nine Records out of Boston about the possibility of working together.

The band was formed by vocalist [a=King Diamond (2)] and guitarist [a=Hank Shermann] in 1981.  The original MF line-up shared members with another Copenhagen band, Danger Zone, whom Diamond and Shermann were helping out.  By 1982, the ""classic"" Mercyful Fate line up of Diamond, Shermann, guitarist Michael Denner (ex-Brats and Danger Zone), bassist Timi ""Grabber"" Hansen (Danger Zone), and drummer Kim Ruzz was in place. Over the next couple years, the band would release an EP and 2 LPs that would cement their reputation as one the most influential metal bands of the early 1980s.  King Diamond's blasphemous lyrics and theatrical stage presence would have many label the band as part of the 1st wave of black metal, although musically the band was closer to the style of Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  The group split in 1985, as Shermann decided he wanted to pursue a more commercial direction.  King Diamond launched a solo career, taking Denner and Hansen with him, while Kim Ruzz disappeared into the regular world.

The band's legend continued to grow after their split.  In 1993, the classic line up, minus Kim Ruzz, reformed for a new album, ""In The Shadows"".  Hansen dropped out after that release but the group continued on throughout the 1990s.  At the same time, King Diamond kept his own solo career going.  Michael Denner left the band after 1996's ""Into The Unknown"" and Diamond and Sherman continued on with new players.  1999's ""9"" is, to date, the band's last full-length release.  King Diamond has stated that MF has not split up but the band is on hold for the foreseeable future.  In 2009, Diamond, Shermann, Denner, Hansen, and drummer Bjarne Holm (who has played with the group since 1994) reunited to re-record the songs ""Evil"" and ""Curse Of The Pharoah"" for the ""Guitar Hero:  Metallica"" video game.

In 2019, the group announced they would be playing a series of live dates.  The line up would include Diamond, Sherman, Wead, Holm, and bassist Joey Vera (filling in for Timi Hansen, who was battling cancer). Timi Hansen lost his battle with cancer on November 4th, 2019.

The latter were transformed entirely when [a10360] from [a10343] met up with them, and formed Ash Ra Tempel. 

The trio of Göttsching / Enke / Schulze decided to abandon conventional composition and songwriting in favour of free-form improvising and developing a new musical language. As such, they became notorious for jams that could exceed 30 minutes (some such recordings can be found on [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1406291-The-Private-Tapes]The Private Tapes[/url] releases). Ash Ra Tempel went to Hamburg in March 1971 to record their debut, with the aid of top engineer [a40135]. A Krautrock twist on the space-rock music as pioneered by Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, with elements of both yet devoid of songs. One track per side: the power-drive storming ""Amboss"" and the shimmering timeless ""Traummaschine"". A yin-and-yang type concept that was followed on further albums. 

Schulze departed after the band's debut, with lots of other musicians passing through the group for their second album Schwingungen. The record had psychedelic blues numbers on one side, and a deep space trip on the other. The same concept appearing on the similarly balanced Seven Up collaboration with acid guru [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/21068-Dr-Timothy-Leary]Timothy Leary[/url]. Other related ""super-sessions"" were born out of this so-called [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1970698-The-Cosmic-Couriers]Cosmic Couriers[/url] collaboration idea included albums with [a256782], [a256792] and [a222379]. Schulze returned for the band's 4th album Join Inn, in 1973.

Hartmut soon left the band and abandoned music altogether, leaving Göttsching to keep the band-name going, with the duo project Starring Rosi, the cosmic guitar album Inventions For Electric Guitar, and the album New Age Of Earth, after which Ash Ra Tempel were re-branded as [a49639]. A later incarnation of the band was called [a5947028]. The members were [a29855], [a549], [a761608] and [a340847]. When Göttsching died in December 2022, the Ash Ra projects died with him."

As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched.

In 1998, Pig Destroyer toured the East Coast with other bands, including Drop Dead, Converge, Kid Dynamite, and Isis.

The band continued to tour with bands like Discordance Axis, Phobia, Daybreak, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Disassociate. They also played at the 2000 March Metal Meltdown. 

In July 2000, the band signed with Relapse, and recorded a split 7"" with Isis. It sold out in a month. They later recorded and released ""38 Counts Of Battery,"" which included the remastered ""Explosions In Ward 6"" album, tracks from the Isis and Orchid splits and their demo from 1997.

The band originally teamed up with Stillborn Records and released 2004’s Heart Means Everything which was extremely well received by punk and hardcore scenes alike. With Honor toured incessantly in support of the aforementioned release with bands like Hatebreed, Sick Of It All, and Comeback Kid and gained numerous fans by playing festivals like New England Metalfest, Hellfest, and Skatefest, gaining the attention of several large independent labels. Jay said, “We chose Victory because of their strong reputation and our respect for the history and bands on the label. We couldn’t have found a better place to call home.” 

This Is Our Revenge was recorded in June of 2005 at the legendary Salad Days studios with the one and only Brian McTernan. “Working with Brian was definitely a learning experience. We learned how to look at song writing in a whole new way. In the end, Brian was able to find all of our strengths and bring them out to create an accurate representation of the band”, Jay said. The title of their debut Victory album, This Is Our Revenge, pertains to the fact that music and various art forms provide an outlet from society and is a revenge on the prescribed way people are supposed to live. For the members of With Honor, the record is also a realization that rather than constant anticipation of things to come, these moments are the defining ones of their lives. "

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.

(Originally named Troop 101)

Soulful, fresh, genre-defying. These are only a few of the terms that immediately spark the mind when greeted with Anarbor’s gutsy and transcending EP, Free Your Mind. When noted that the aforementioned genre is pop-rock, it seems even more special that a band with this talent and bravado would push itself away from a scene where predetermined trappings threaten to undermine its singular integrity.
“We know that every single kid out there is tired of the same old dance-pop record that gets released every single week. Our goal is to be the music scene’s saving grace,” says guitarist Mike Kitlas. “It will tell our listeners that we are here to stay and we are not a fad band that will fade out as soon as dance-pop is outdated.”

Free Your Mind extends beyond the cut-and-paste albums being churned out, instead infusing dynamic guitars behind the soul-shaking howls and relatable melodies from frontman Slade Echeverria. Crafted in Los Angeles by producer Mike Green (Paramore, Good Charlotte) over a four-week span in Los Angeles, Free Your Mind's formation came from a desire to break out from the ""fad band"" chokehold and delve into what was real.
The EP's lyrical themes of drama-addled love are age-appropriate for this band still fresh from cap and gown status, yet show emerging maturity and growth while navigating the waters of life on the road and in the press, as well as their loss of anonymity. Not one track doesn’t contain a purpose or reason ripped from the band’s own personal headlines, and the EP title wasn’t without a conscious peek into their agenda, either.
“We want to challenge kids to think outside of the norm, and really find themselves, rather then just following what the crowd is doing,” Kitlas said. “We want to show our listeners that they are not alone, we all go through our struggles and everyone has their ups and downs in life.”
The seven-track EP, kicks off with a mischievous call to a wayward paramour on “Let The Games Begin,” before sliding into the instant hip-shaking grooves of “The Brightest Green,” a slice of Maroon 5-ish soul that takes on a life of its own. Anarbor takes a familiar formula but adds a warmth and genuineness to every guitar lick and lyric that keeps them relatable yet unique. Each track seamlessly follows the next, spinning clever lyrics and brisk guitars, and each adds another deft chapter to this memorable volume.

“The distinctive sound we are reaching for is rock and roll. We don't use any instruments in our songs that we don’t play live, we are going for a very raw and real sound for this record,” Kitlas said. When noted that shared influences range from Third Eye Blind to Red Hot Chili Peppers, it’s even more apparent where the EP’s driving and fully-executed rock-based energy gained its roots.
The easy nature and chemistry of the band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2003 is more than just a cosmic luck for an emerging band. Because this, in years of formation, is by no means a freshman band. Echeverria and Kitlas became friends in grade school, and continued to grow up experiencing many life-changing events together, securing a bond that eventually extended to music, and a decision to make it their ultimate ambition. The band signed to Hopeless Records before they even received their high school diplomas.
More than just a sum of its parts, the writing process for Anarbor is a group united, with each member adding input in acoustic jam sessions that allows everyone to collaborate and contribute creatively. It’s a cohesion that allowed each member’s personal preferences and talents shine when it came to recording.

Sharing the stage with everyone from Fall Out Boy to the Gin Blossoms, as well as a coveted spot on this year’s Take Action! Tour, Anarbor is gaining steady recognition as the diverse band to watch among a sea of faux rock ‘n rollers. This motivated and utterly gifted band will resonate with any listener who knows a thing or two about learning who you are and putting your ambitions into motion.
“We want people to walk away feeling comforted and confident in themselves,” Kitlas said. “Music is a universal language that everyone can relate to. We talk about our real life stories, feelings and situations. You can expect real music and real lyrics, no filler.”

More recently, Anarbor independently released their eponymous third studio album entitled, “Anarbor” in June of 2016. The album was self-funded and produced by long-time collaborator Matt Keller (Lydia, The Maine, The Summer Set, Katastro). Anarbor is comprised of lead vocalist and bassist Slade Echeverria, guitarist Adam Juwig and guitarist Danny Stravers.

During her time at the academy, she continued playing the piano and writing songs, nurturing her blossoming songwriting skills. Upon graduation, she moved to Hell's Kitchen, where she waitressed five nights a week and performed at local clubs on open mic nights, honing her craft and developing a stage presence. At home, she would often stay up until 4 a.m. recording demos on a four-track machine, and was signed to A&M Records in 2001. Her first video, for the song ""A Thousand Miles,"" was released even as she continued recording her debut album, and it became an instant smash on MTV, as well as cracking the American Top Ten.

Founded in late 1965, the group achieved worldwide acclaim, initially with innovative psychedelic music, and later in a genre that came to be termed progressive rock.

Distinguished by philosophical lyrics, musical experimentation, frequent use of sound effects and elaborate live shows, Pink Floyd remains one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.

165426,270740,2418930,US,Reel Big Fish,"Fame, Fortune and Fornication",2009,0.0,11,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Ska', 'Punk']","A ska-punk band from Huntington Beach, California. Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Behold the debut album from Eagle Twin. Although Eagle Twin is a very new entity its helmsman: Gentry Densley is no stranger to innovative, heavy music. Densley was the musical visionary and leader of the legendary jazz, prog, rock, metal, hardcore group Iceburn (aka The Iceburn Collective) from 1991-2001.

Iceburn has been called the greatest and most important musical offering from Salt Lake City since the Osmonds! Gentrys’ playing has been very influential to a lot of successful modern music groups such as: Isis, Pelican, Sunn O))) etc...

In order to disseminate his majestic and mountainous riffs in the present day he enlisted massively behemoth skinsman Tyler Smith. The drums are not only a driving force that efficiently steam rolls over you they conjure a repetitious mantra that is eerily infectious.

Although Iceburn was primarily a instrumental force, with Eagle Twin Gentry is much more vocal and the depth of his lyrics is endless. His vocal evocations bring to mind the hoarse rasp of Tom Waits and Howlin Wolf but possibly channeled through Tuvan throat singers. His voice, is used much like an instrument and often times creates a unique drone of its own. The riffs and music definitely have familiar reference points (Caspar Brotzmann Massaker, Earth, Sunn O))), Melvins etc...) but are crafted in a way that stands miles beyond the others.

The group signed to Hopeless Records in 2014 and released their first full-length for the label, ""Free"", on June 12, 2015. In 2016, the band was rejoined by lead guitarist and original member Alex Blackwell IV after Blake Hardman departed. They released their fourth full-length ""RARE"" on June 16, 2017, which marked a radical change in sound, departing from their melodic hardcore sound in favor for an indie rock and shoegaze direction.

We wanted to keep the music modern, but using older influences as well”, said guitarist Jay Aust. With Honor immediately established a solid team which consists of vocalist Todd Mackey, guitarists Jay and Jeff Aust, bass player Jack Caron and Jon Ross on drums. The band originally teamed up with Stillborn Records and released 2004’s Heart Means Everything which was extremely well received by punk and hardcore scenes alike. With Honor toured incessantly in support of the aforementioned release with bands like Hatebreed, Sick Of It All, and Comeback Kid and gained numerous fans by playing festivals like New England Metalfest, Hellfest, and Skatefest, gaining the attention of several large independent labels. Jay said, “We chose Victory because of their strong reputation and our respect for the history and bands on the label. We couldn’t have found a better place to call home.” 

This Is Our Revenge was recorded in June of 2005 at the legendary Salad Days studios with the one and only Brian McTernan. “Working with Brian was definitely a learning experience. We learned how to look at song writing in a whole new way. In the end, Brian was able to find all of our strengths and bring them out to create an accurate representation of the band”, Jay said. The title of their debut Victory album, This Is Our Revenge, pertains to the fact that music and various art forms provide an outlet from society and is a revenge on the prescribed way people are supposed to live. For the members of With Honor, the record is also a realization that rather than constant anticipation of things to come, these moments are the defining ones of their lives. "

With a new drummer they released ""Pierced From Within"" in 1995. On tour, Frank Mullen was replaced by Keith DeVito. Doug Bohn eventually also left the band and was replaced by Dave Culross. 
In 1998 they released the EP ""Depise the Sun"". That same EP was apparently the band's last record as they broke up shortly after. 
However, in 2002, the band was resurrected by Frank Mullen, Terrance Hobbs, Derek Boyer, Guy Marchais and Mike Smith. They began playing live shows and in 2004 they released ""Souls to Deny"".

SUFFOCATION is:
Eric Morotti: Drums

The band formed in 1968.

Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

There has been a Deep Purple band in existence since the late 60s, apart from the eight years between 1976 when Mark IV split up and 1984 when Mark II reformed.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Logan dislocated his elbow in the accident, an injury so severe it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career. But the guitarist fought back and after months of painful rehabilitation, he boasted he has never played his instrument better. 

During Manowar's career, the band have recorded 10 studio albums; two live albums; five DVDs and countless compilations.

Manowar's many innovations include:
* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers
* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles
* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra
* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and their own guitars as well
* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions)

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

But in 1995 their first demo ""Ved Ferdens Ende"" was recorded even though they still didn’t have a drummer. After the release Berserk left the band. They finally gained a drummer, Torvus, in 1996 and their second demo ""Possessed"" was recorded. After the release Torvus was kicked out and replaced by Desecrator. Also Diabolus Mort (guitar) came home to Norway after 4 years in the US and joined. 

In 1997 the EP ""Throne Of The Goat"" was recorded and released on Solistitium Records. A year later Nag was in the army and Diabous Mort and Desecrator lost interest in the band. Nag and Draugluin were once again alone, but continued writing material. They were joined by Blod (drums) of Gehenna and Arak Draconiiz (guitar) of Isvind. The promo ""Atum Nocturnem"" was released in 1999 by At War Records. After the promo Drakkar Productions and End All Life Productions got in touch with Tsjuder, and a deal for two albums and tours was signed. At the end of 1999 ""Kill For Satan"" was recorded and in 2000 it was released.

As the band was ready to go on their first tour Blod left because of time limits and was replaced by Anti Christian. After the release of ""Kill For Satan"" Arak Draconiiz moved away from Oslo, and was replaced by Paal. In 2001 Anti Christian had to leave the band because of tendinitis in both arms and Paal also left the band because of his work. Jontho (drums) of Ragnarok then joined the band and together they recorded ""Demonic Possession"" which was released in 2002.

Agnostic Front's frontman Roger Miret would let his younger brother, Freddy ""Madball"" Cricien take the microphone on lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows and that is where it started.
Madball's first few gigs consisted of un-used Agnostic Front songs.

Upon founding the band consisted of 
Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and vocalist Freddy Cricien.
After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, would join the band. 

One year later Roger Miret left the band, and was replaced by bassist Hoya Roc — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band to play with.
The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown.

1995 saw the band participating in the N.Y.H.C. Documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29th, 1995 at the now defunct ""Coney Island High"". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year.

The band briefly broke up from early 2001 until late 2002. This lineup of Freddy Cricien, Hoya Roc, Mitts (ex-Skarhead), and Rigg Ross (ex-Hatebreed) began touring and recording at the end of 2002.  In 2004 they released their first output after they broke-up the ""N.Y.H.C. EP"" via small diy labels Thorp (USA) & GSR Records (Europe). After that the band released their comeback album ""Legacy"" via Ferret Records (USA) and Roadrunner (Europe) in 2005 and it was a great success. Multiple tours (especially Europe) followed."

They changed their name to The Matches in 2002 and released 3 studio albums before going on hiatus in 2009. They have reunited every few years since, celebrating the 10-year anniversaries of each of their albums with performances and deluxe vinyl reissues.

The Locals were formed by high school students [a=Matt Esposito] (lead guitar, backing vocals), Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals), Matt Whalen (drums, percussion), and Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar). [a=Miles Hurwitz] became their manager in 2000 and played a major role in guiding their career, including acting as co-writer and producer. Esposito left after graduating and was replaced by Jon Devoto. As The Locals, the band released a 6-song demo and 3-song EP, and built up a following in the East Bay. In 2002, threatened with a copyright infringement lawsuit by [a=Yvonne Doll And The Locals], they changed their name to The Matches.

The Matches recorded and self-released their first album, [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] (2003). They signed to Epitaph Records, who re-mixed and re-released it the following year. Their second album, [i]Decomposer[/i] (2006) took their music in a more idiosyncratic direction with contributions from nine different record producers. It reached no. 18 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. Extensive worldwide touring followed over the next two years. Their third album, [i]A Band In Hope[/i], was released in March 2008 and found them shifting further away from pop-punk. It reached no. 179 on the [i]Billboard[/i] 200. San Souci left the band that July and was replaced by Dylan Rowe.

The Matches announced a hiatus in July 2009. Shortly thereafter, they self-released the digital album [i]The Matches Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title? Or Not Needed?[/i], a collection of demos and unreleased tracks. Devoto started [a=Bird By Bird], while Harris started [a=Maniac (19)], then [a=Fortress Social Club].

In 2014 the lineup of Harris, San Souci, Whalen, and Devoto reconvened to re-release [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] as a deluxe 2-LP set. A string of reunion shows resulted in the digital live album [i]10YearsEVDKTL[/i]. A new single, ""Life Of A Match / Crucial Comeback"", followed in 2015. The following year they re-released [i]Decomposer[/i], also as a deluxe 2-LP set, and again played a series of shows resulting in a digital live album, [i]Recomposer[/i].

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.

Hooded Menace was formed by Lasse (also known from the cult Finnish death metal band Phlegethon and death/grinders Vacant Coffin) in the summer of 2007. Very much influenced by the first Cathedral album, Winter, and Asphyx the band wanted to do play really doom-laden death metal that combined crushing and somber riffs with just a slight hint of melody that comes from their love for the early Candlemass albums from the 80's.
Lyric-wise the band drew inspiration from the classic 70's Spanish horror series the Blind Dead that included the films ""Tombs of the Blind Dead"", ""Return of the Evil Dead"", ""Horror of the Zombies"", and ""Night of the Seagulls"". The rotting, eyeless Templar knights who rode on horses and drank the blood of their victims had an influence on the music as well. The slow, heavy pacing of the Knights Templars is there... in the riffs.
The band recorded a 2-song promo demo, titled ""The Eyeless Horde"" and quickly began promoting it in the underground. Pretty soon a Czech label Doomentia Records wanted to put out the demo on 7"" EP. Razorback Records released the debut album ""Fulfill The Curse"" on CD in 2008 and the vinyl version released by Doomentia Records followed during the same year.
In 2009 the band got signed to Profound Lore Records and the Canadian label released the CD of the anticipated second album ""Never Cross The Dead"" in 2010. Split 7"" EPs with Anima Morte and Coffins were released by Doomentia Records as well as the vinyl version of ""Never Cross The Dead"". In 2010 Doomentia also re-issued the debut album ""Fulfill The Curse"" in digipack CD. A split 7"" with Asphyx is lined up for 2010. In June 2011 Hooded Menace signed to Relapse Records.
Hooded Menace are looking to spread their music to fans of totally heavy and ultra-crushing doom and old school early 90's style death metal.

By 1990, both Lee and Wilson were out of the band, with Chance moving to bass, and the duo using a drum machine in order to write songs. In 1991, Matt Sargent (another ex-Grindin Teeth member) became the band’s drummer. The band played a few shows and contributed a track on the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/9377931-Various-Great-Big-Pile] Great Big Pile [/url] comp, before taking a break in 1993 so Walsh and Chance focus on their new project “No Rock Gods”. The trio resumed playing in 1994, and in 1996 their first release (a self-titled CD), appeared on [l47646].

After the CD’s release, Sargent left to play guitar in his Surf-Rock band. In 1997, he was replaced by [a2198499], with Kyle Phillips also joining the same year on second guitar. The band soon entered the studio (minus Phillips, who had gone to rehab) to record a few tracks that would later appear on the 2008 12”, “Hot Sex”. Later that year, the trio did another session, which would be released as their second album “Rehab” in 2003. After the album’s release, Chance separated from Walsh and left the band.

Shaun Kelly replaced Chance on bass in 2004, but left the band in 2007, and was in turn replaced by [a=Richie G.]. The new trio entered the studio in 2008 to record an improvised album for [l17358], entitled “Dead”. In 2011, Adam Ferguson was added on second guitar, but moved to bass in 2014, after Richie passed away the same year. In 2015 keyboardist Mel entered the band. In 2016, Walsh decided it was time for Rusted Shut to break-up.

In 2022, the trio of Walsh / Domokos / Adam got back together and restarted Rusted Shut."

SKINLESS exploded onto the metal scene in 1992. Despite a variety of lineup changes, the songwriting team of Noah Carpenter (guitars) and Sherwood Webber (vocals) has remained constant since 1994. After adding the talents of Bob Beaulac (drums) and Joe Keyser (bass) SKINLESS established a solid, dedicated line-up, recorded two demos and appeared on numerous compilations.

In 1998, SKINLESS released their full-length debut 'Progression Towards Evil.' Recorded at Max Trax Studios in Albany, NY 'Progression...' stunned the underground, showcasing the musicianship and energy that the band had become known for via its intense live performances. An entirely independent release, 'Progression...' received frenzied acclaim from press the world over and saw remarkable sales. SKINLESS embarked on three immensely successful tours in support of 'Progression...' introducing legions of fans to the punishing live SKINLESS experience. The band toured the US with underground legends MORTICIAN on 1999's Chainsaw Tour, and in the Spring of 2000, SKINLESS toured the U.S. and Mexico with INCANTATION, spawning even more followers of the brutal underground revolution. Their subsequent European headlining tour claimed further disciples.

On their Relapse debut 'Foreshadowing Our Demise,' SKINLESS painted violent pictures of utter devastation. 'Foreshadowing Our Demise' sonically documented the endless energy of the band's burly live performances, delivering an annihilating combination of punishing grooves and ultimate brutality. SKINLESS' gut-twisting deathgrind deluged listeners with colossal riffs, chaotic percussion and Webber's scathing vocal attack. SKINLESS toured as much as possible in 2001/2002, being personally invited to hit the road with the likes of HATEBREED and SIX FEET UNDER, thus furthering their growing following.

The band, despite playing numerous live shows and releasing a slew of 7"" singles and three full length albums, never received much attention outside of their local fanbase. Even when they were together, Harvey Milk releases were notoriously hard to find. 

It was not until years after the band's demise that their singles, as well as all three full length albums, saw re-release through various labels, most notably Relapse Records. 

While Harvey Milk invariably draws comparisons to the [a=Melvins], due to their penchant for slow, heavy riffs, the band has touched upon such artists as [a=ZZ Top], [a=Led Zeppelin] and [a=Leonard Cohen] as influences in their music.

Their vinyl collections were growing, as was their distaste for modern metal. On a mission to destroy false-thrash Black Metal spinoff bands, Hellfiend and Bulldoze started auditioning different drummers in '96, until Andy came back into the picture to complete the thrashing trio. The trio recorded their split 7"" with Nunslaughter in the winter of 96/97 and played shows with Dark Funeral, Birthright, Lord Weird Slough Feg, and many other local metal acts, as well as the San Bernadino Metalfest, sandwiched between the Haunted and The Ravenous. The band then recorded their debut album ""We Will Destroy... You Will Obey"" in 1999 with guitar guru James Murphy. Shortly thereafter Dekapitator sought to add a second guitarist, first bringing in Wes Blackwulf, who was later replaced by Brad Attitude, which also didn't last, leaving the band as a trio once again. Dekapitator continued to play throughout the Bay Area, including supporting slots for Exodus and Thor, among others. Upon reconvening a couple of years ago to get things rolling again, the band recruited new guitarist D. Attacker. Dekapitator began writing for their next full-length and playing out again. In 2007 the band completed work on said full-length, ?he Storm Before the Calm? and through a long-standing friendship, joined the Relapse Records roster."

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois. The Event flyer read, ""They Said It Would Never Happen... The Original Misfits."""

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".

They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

Reid suggested that Page contact Robert Plant, who was singing with a band called Hobbstweedle.

The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist [a251808] and bass guitarist [a374278] in the year 1983. Despite many line-up changes, Megadeth is partly responsible for the popularization of thrash metal in the late 1980s. The band was also notorious for its substance abuse, a contributing factor to their continuous revolving door of band members. The group nonetheless found sobriety and a stable line-up with 1990 release [m=32937], a trend which continued until 1998 with the departure of drummer Nick Menza. During that period, the band released four studio albums, including [m=32933], which is Megadeth's most commercially successful album.

Dave Mustaine disbanded Megadeth in 2002 due to a nerve injury he had suffered on his left arm. Following a year of physical therapy Mustaine began work on what was to be his first solo album, however contractual obligations forced [m=33085] to be released under the Megadeth name, following which, Mustaine decided to reform the band in 2004. The band has since released five studio albums, but continued to have several line-up changes through 2000s and 2010s, with Mustaine remaining the only constant member. Co-founder Ellefson, who took legal actions against the band during the disbandment, rejoined in 2010 but was fired from the band in 2021.

Winner of one Grammy Award:
- Best Metal Performance for ""Dystopia"" from [m=946104] album.

They started writing songs for the new album, which turned out to be technical and faster then the previous release, so they asked Frost to join them as a session drummer.

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

He released his first demo in 1993. In 1995 the debut album ""The Cold Earth Slept Below"" was released on Moribund Records. 

He released the 7"" EP ""Arise, My Lord"" in 1996. He also participated in two other bands, Sarcophagus and Seeds of Hate. ""Thy Dying Light"" was recorded and was to be released at Head Not Found but the parent company Voices of Wonder refused to release due to the extremity of Judas Iscariot. It was later released by Moribund Records Cult. 

Akhenaten moved from America to Germany and recorded ""Of Great Eternity"" which was released in 1997. The following two years he managed to release ""Distant in Solitary Night"" which was recorded back in 1996. He also signed a contract with the American label Red Stream. They had heard his new work ""Heaven in Flames"" and agreed to release it. In 2000 he released the MCD ""Dethroned, Conquered and Forgotten"". 

Same year, a live album ""Under the Black Sun"" was released and a split 7"" EP with Krieg, ""To the Coming Age of Intolerance"" in 2001. 

In 2002, ""To Embrace the Corpses Bleeding"" and the MCD ""Moonlight Butchery"" were released, also the EPs ""March of the Apocalypse"" and ""Midnight Frost"". Shortly after, Akhenaten announced that he decided to end the band.

The same night they were formed they also recorded their first demo, ""The Art of Dying"". It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

It was started by Toru with High School friends Alex and Ryota after each of them got their musical instruments. After that, Taka joined as their vocalist and they focused on performing shows in the Tokyo area.

In 2006 they independently released 2 mini albums. Because of their albums sales, their participation in relatively large festivals that summer and their energetic shows in the outskirts of Tokyo, they were noticed by a foreign record company.

In March 2007 Tomoya officially joined the group and the band finally made their major debut by releasing their first single 内秘心書(Naihi Shinsho) on April 25th.

The band’s name, One Ok Rock, came from “one o’clock,” the time that the band used to practice on weekends. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between r’s and l’s, they changed “o’clock” to “o’crock” (or “o’krock”) which then was separated to become “ok rock”.

On April 5th, 2009, Alex was arrested for allegedly groping a female prep school student. They were going to release the single 「Ａｒｏｕｎｄ　ザ　ｗｏｒｌｄ　少年」on May 6th but this was cancelled. The song was also going to be used for the drama ‘God Hand Teru’ but was replaced. Also, a nationwide tour was cancelled because of the incident. On May 15th, it was announced the Alex has left the group and the other 4 members would continue activites in the summer without him.

ONE OK ROCK continued as a four-member group and made a comeback with a live concert tour that started on September 5, 2009, titled Overcome Emotion. Their first release afterwards was their fourth single, “Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer”, on February 3, 2010. The band followed up with their fourth album, Niche Syndrome, which was released on June 9. Their next single, “Answer is Near”, was released on February 16, 2011.

The band released their first double A-side single “Re:make/No Scared” on July 20, 2011, the latter song being the main theme for the Black Rock Shooter: The Game video game. The band’s fifth album, Zankyo Reference, was released on October 5, 2011. Their latest single, “The Beginning”, which is used as a theme for the live action movie adaptation of the Rurouni Kenshin manga, was released on August 22, 2012."

Singer/guitarist John Tran (stage name Johnee Trash/John E. Trash), singer/guitarist Ian ""Slur"" Cone, and drummer Bob ""Stress"" Herco met while classmates at El Modena High School in Orange, and formed Home Grown shortly after graduating. Adding singer/bassist Adam ""Adumb"" Lohrbach (who had attended Estancia High School in nearby Costa Mesa), they released their debut 7"" EP [i]Smoking Is Cool[/i] in 1994 on Insta-Noise Records. Their first full-length album, [i]That's Business[/i], was released in 1995 on local label Liberation Records. It was given an overseas release in Europe and Sweden in 1996 by Burning Heart Records, who also released their EP [i]Wusappaning?![/i] the same year (a U.S. release of the EP came in 1998 on Cargo Music/Grilled Cheese). The band's early sound was heavily influenced by ska-punk, leading to their inclusion on a number of punk- and ska-themed compilations.

Home Grown signed to major label Outpost Recordings, who released their second album, [i]Act Your Age[/i] (1998). A new recording of the [i]That's Business[/i] song ""Surfer Girl"" was released as the album's single. Cone left the band after the album's release, and was replaced by Justin Poyser. That December, Herco had surgery to remove a brain tumor. He underwent rehabilitation, was able to tour, and played on the 1999 EP [i]EP Phone Home[/i], released on Fueled By Ramen. However, he did not play on Home Grown's 2000 split EP with [a=Limbeck] on Utility Records, titled [i]Connection[/i] (Tran played drums on one track, while Poyser played on the other two). He left the band that September, citing complications from his surgery. Darren Reynolds of [a=Longfellow] was recruited to fill in for a tour that began the following month. A few dates into the tour, Poyser quit the group over personal differences, reducing them to a trio. Reynolds' membership became permanent by early 2001, but Outpost Recordings folded, leaving the band without a recording contract.

In June 2001 Home Grown signed with Drive Thru Records, who released their 2002 album [i]Kings Of Pop[/i], which found them leaning fully into a pop punk sound. Shortly after its release, guitarist Dan Hammond (of This Camero) joined the band to play on that summer's Warped Tour, eventually becoming a full time member. [i]Kings Of Pop[/i] was supported by a single and music video for ""You're Not Alone"" and additional videos for ""Kiss Me, Diss Me"" and ""I Love You, Not"". The EP [i]When It All Comes Down[/i] followed in 2004, showing the band maturing musically and lyrically. Lohrbach left Home Grown in April 2005, going on to co-found [a=New Years Day]. Home Grown continued as a live act, bringing in bassist Ted Vega, but went on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Tran started a new band called Red Panda, while Reynolds started a band called Defender and Hammond joined [a=Paper Models]."

Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009.

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched. Same year recorded the MCD called ""Ex Inferis"" at the Ballerina Studio. It contained a new studio track, a cover and three previously released tracks. 

In 2003 they released ""Sheol"" which gained them major success.

The King Diamond band was formed in 1985 by Danish vocalist King Diamond following the break-up of his previous band, [a=Mercyful Fate].  The original line-up consisted of Diamond, his former Mercyful Fate bandmates Michael Denner (guitar) and Timi Hansen (bass), and Swedes Mikkey Dee (drums) and Andy LaRoque (guitar).  This line-up lasted for two albums before Denner and Hansen departed, the first of many line-up changes for the band.  To date, LaRoque is the only musician besides King Diamond to appear on every King Diamond band release.

With the King Diamond band, Diamond traded the occult-based and blasphemous lyrics of Mercyful Fate for a gothic horror approach.  Almost all of the lyrics on King Diamond's albums revolve around a specific story.  Only the band's debut, ""Fatal Portrait,"" and 1995's ""Spider's Lullaby"" stray from this formula, although, even in those cases, several of the songs on the albums feature lyrics that are related to each other.  In 2003, Hungarian vocalist Livia Zita was brought onboard to provide female vocals.  It marked the first time that King Diamond worked with another vocalist on any of his projects (excluding any guest appearances he made on other artists' projects).  King and Livia were later married.

The group saw their commercial success reach its peak in the mid and late 1980's, and their second album, ""Abigail"" is considered a heavy metal classic.  The group was also a target for parents' and watchdog groups who objected to King Diamond's image and what they perceived to be questionable content (although the latter was mostly based on the King's work with Mercyful Fate and his personal connections to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan).  The band has continued to work steadily, although they have been on hold in recent years because of King Diamond's health issues, which include back surgery in 2007, and a triple-bypass in 2010."

All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.

When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Jucifer's G. Edgar Livengood and G. Amber Valentine are known for their brutal beauty and fiery intensity on stage and have enjoyed the fruits of their labor as they garner an ever-increasing buzz and the most loyal of fan basses.

Jucifer's first foray in the studio back in 1995 produced songs that would be released on a fan-funded, independently released 7"", Superman B/W Licorice. 1996 saw the duo embarking on their first tour and completing work on their first full-length, Calling All Cars on the Vegas Strip, which didn't see a release until a friend helped fund another independent release in 1998. Calling All Cars..., and the radio singles it produced, caught the attention of Capricorn Records who signed the band 1999 and who would later re-issue Calling All Cars....

The band spent most of '99 writing and recording their Capricorn debut, I Name You Destroyer, and hit the road touring throughout most of 2000 and 2001 in anticipation for its release which wouldn't come for almost two years after its completion. The release of what was to be a 'tour-only' EP, Lambs, did see its release in 2001 but was available in stores as well. 2002 saw the over-due release of I Name You Destroyer. In its wake was a frenzy of critical acclaim and back-breaking touring with Jucifer taking only two months off the entire year.

Jucifer recorded another EP, War Bird, in July of 2003. War Bird would see its release in March of the following year as the band began to compile material for their next full-length. 2004 also saw the release of the band's first home video / DVD, A Partridge In A Pear Tree via AmberVillain Films. The band continued to work on their next full-length, If Thine Enemy Hunger in between performing regularly throughout 2005.

In April of 2006, Jucifer inked a deal with Relapse Records with If Thine Enemy Hunger being their debut release for the label. In 2007, Jucifer finally realized their desire to write and record a double LP worth? of songs based on the French Revolution. This album, L?utrichienne, focuses mainly on French Queen Marie Antoinette, who was executed by guillotine at the height of the revolution, and her relationship with Louis XVI. L?utrichienne, Jucifer's sophomore release for Relapse, will see a March 18th 2008 North American release date, March 24th internationally. Livengood and Valentine have domesticated the term road-warriors by becoming road-homemakers. In 2001, the two purchased a Winnebago that would later replace their stick-n-mortar home allowing them to play shows consistently and consecutively throughout North America.

They've played with such diverse artists as VIC CHESNUTT, THE MELVINS, CHIMAIRA, HIGH ON FIRE, MASTODON, MIKE WATT, MAN OR ASTROMAN, DYSRHTHMIA, ROYAL TUX, BURIED INSIDE and many, many more over the course of their 10+ year touring career. The list of bands they have been compared to reads with similar diversity; MINOR THREAT meets THE CARPENTERS, SLAYER to SLEEP, VERUCA SALT to MY BLOODY VALENTINE, sprinkled with a little PIXIES, PORTISHEAD, PANTERA, NIRVANA and NAPALM DEATH.

Chosen by Alternative Press in 2004 as one of the top 100 bands to watch, Jucifer has a rare ability to bring together fans of almost every genre. Their devotion to intensity and disdain for stylistic rules tends to inspire strong reactions. The dichotomy between Jucifer's lulling, melodic passages, high-volume sludge and brutal machine gun off-time (not to mention the contrast of female vocals alternately siren and banshee) may not appeal to those who like hearing the same old rock music recycled again and again. Amber and Edgar bleed doom, pop, noise and majesty.
