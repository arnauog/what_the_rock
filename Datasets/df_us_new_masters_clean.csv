Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

153073,188161,1965407,US,KISS,Sonic Boom,2009,130.93,30,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Glam', 'Heavy Metal']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Playing in local Chicago punk clubs, the group self-released their debut album, ""Mo' Money, Mo' 40'z"". The band got their first real break when front man Tony Lovato sent the band's album to Goldfinger's John Feldmann who helped them get signed to Maverick Records, and produced their major-label debut, ""Wasting Time"", which was released in July 2000. Since then the band has released three more albums on Maverick —2001's ""Destination Unknown"", 2003's self-titled disc, and 2005's ""Photographs""—and toured the world as part of the Warped Tour.
Tensions between the band members about the musical direction of the band, growing up, starting a family and not wanting to tour as much caused the band to break-up in 2006, and Mest announced their breakup, as well as a farewell tour entitled ""So Long and Thanx for the Booze"".
After spending some time off, Lovato was inspired to start writing music again. He joined up with new guitarist Mike Longworthand new drummer Lil Rich Gonzales. The end result was a series of pop-punk songs that paid tribute to Mest's past, but pushed the band forward into the future. They released a new album, ""Not What You Expected"". Lovato asked Tom Denney from A Day To Remember to co-write a song with him. The track is ""Radio (Something To Believe)"" and is an ode to all the bands that the duo grew up listening to. Jeremy, from A Day To Remember, jumped in the studio to record a part for the song."

The King Diamond band was formed in 1985 by Danish vocalist King Diamond following the break-up of his previous band, [a=Mercyful Fate].  The original line-up consisted of Diamond, his former Mercyful Fate bandmates Michael Denner (guitar) and Timi Hansen (bass), and Swedes Mikkey Dee (drums) and Andy LaRoque (guitar).  This line-up lasted for two albums before Denner and Hansen departed, the first of many line-up changes for the band.  To date, LaRoque is the only musician besides King Diamond to appear on every King Diamond band release.

With the King Diamond band, Diamond traded the occult-based and blasphemous lyrics of Mercyful Fate for a gothic horror approach.  Almost all of the lyrics on King Diamond's albums revolve around a specific story.  Only the band's debut, ""Fatal Portrait,"" and 1995's ""Spider's Lullaby"" stray from this formula, although, even in those cases, several of the songs on the albums feature lyrics that are related to each other.  In 2003, Hungarian vocalist Livia Zita was brought onboard to provide female vocals.  It marked the first time that King Diamond worked with another vocalist on any of his projects (excluding any guest appearances he made on other artists' projects).  King and Livia were later married.

The group saw their commercial success reach its peak in the mid and late 1980's, and their second album, ""Abigail"" is considered a heavy metal classic.  The group was also a target for parents' and watchdog groups who objected to King Diamond's image and what they perceived to be questionable content (although the latter was mostly based on the King's work with Mercyful Fate and his personal connections to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan).  The band has continued to work steadily, although they have been on hold in recent years because of King Diamond's health issues, which include back surgery in 2007, and a triple-bypass in 2010."

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name.

In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

Cradle of Filth was founded in 1991 as a death metal act, however quickly transitioned to being a second-wave black metal band by the release of their debut album. Since then, the band's musical style has gradually evolved to encompass a wide variety of influences including death, black, gothic and heavy metal. The band's lyrics and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, mythology, occultism, and horror films and have both drawn a fair amount of controversy over the course of their career. The exact sub-genre the band plays is difficult to classify and is often a subject of debate.

The band has gone through several line-up changes throughout the years and as of 2014 frontman Dani Filth is the only remaining founding member, as well as the only member to stay in the band since its inception.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

After releasing 4 studio albums and 1 live album under the name Devin Townsend (Ocean Machine Biomech, Infinity, the live album Official Bootleg, Physicist, and Terria), Devin changed the band name to The Devin Townsend Band to reflect his first stable lineup of backing musicians.

The band was formed in Birmingham, England in 1969 by guitarist John Perry (who died shortly after and was replaced by [a=Ernie Chataway]), bassist [a=Bruno Stapenhill], drummer [a=John Partridge (2)], and singer [a=Al Atkins], who created a band name from Bob Dylan's song '[i][r=3881740][/i]'. In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Drummers John Ellis and [a=Chris Campbell (30)] replaced Partridge. Later, in 1973, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Campbell, respectively. A song from the last show with Atkins and Campbell and three from Halford and Hinch's first were released in 2019 on the compilation [m=1794713]. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018. For the Firepower tour he was temporarily replaced by Andy Sneap, making Hill and Halford the only remaining members from the band's early era."

This changed in December 2016 when [a259284] officially became the second member of the band. Nine Inch Nails straddles a wide range of many styles of rock music and other genres that require an electronic sound, which can often cause drastic changes in sound from album to album. However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band. In 2020, Nine Inch Nails was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame."

They mix elements from both heavy metal and hip-hop.

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Although he enjoyed success with ""Bat Out of Hell"" and ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell"" and earned a Grammy Award for 'Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance' for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native US. However, he retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for the number of weeks overall spent on the charts as of 2006. He ranked 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

He was one of the best-selling artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million copies. He has also appeared in over 50 movies and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His most notable roles included 'Eddie' in the American premiere of ""The Rocky Horror Show"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and Robert ""Bob"" Paulson in Fight Club.

260864,231316,2173050,US,Destruction,Metal Discharge,2003,66.03,18,['Album'],['Rock'],['Thrash'],"Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Weil am Rhein (Germany). 

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

For 51 years the band consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard and bassist and co-lead vocalist Dusty Hill, who was replaced (at his request) by the band's bass technician Elwood Francis after Hill's death on July 28, 2021. The band were formed by former [a684681] members Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell with bassist Lanier Greig, which form they recorded debut single [m329083]. Mitchell and Greig were then almost immediately replaced by former [a1057516] drummer Frank Beard and Billy Etheridge respectively, finalising their classic line-up when Dusty Hill, another former member of American Blues, replaced Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units. ZZ Top also ranks 80th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units."

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."
66025,369023,3104700,US,Anthrax,Worship Music,2011,65.83,13,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Thrash', 'Heavy Metal']","Thrash metal (heavy metal) band (1985-1990, 2004-present) and alternative rock (modern rock) band (1993-2003) from New York City, New York, United States.

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

In the beginning their music was described as a fusion between metalcore, nu metal, industrial metal and groove metal, with additional elements of melodic death metal, to form a style the band themselves have described as ""Future Fusion Metal"".

After losing not one, but 2 frontmen and a touring frontman within 5 years, most bands would have called it quits. But not these guys, oh no. They recruited French singer Guillaume Bideau and together they took the band to new heights, releasing the critically heralded album ‘Passenger’ in early 2007.

Relentless touring and hard work got them to the point of a well-respected metal band, but their big break came when they got a chance to open for the mighty Metallica. They played their hearts out during this gig in Denmark and pleased the gods of heavy so much that they were asked to open on a leg of Metallica’s European summer tour. This was a dream chance for any band, but for mnemic it was the chance to show Europe just what a force of heavy metal awesomeness they really are. 

Right now, MNEMIC are either going on hiatus or breaking up. Only future will tell...

The music is at once modern, organic, and other-worldly; songs are stirring sonic journeys channeling the rhythms of the earth and the resonance of the human voice with the synthetic sounds of machines, amplifiers, chaos, and effects. Founded in Peoria in 2002, Minsk has been cultivating sonic exploration and deeply spiritual and emotional outpourings since its inception. The early years were furtive; harboring a locally produced demo (enitled 'Burning'), a West Coast tour, an appearance at the inaugural Templars of Doom Festival in 2004, and a contribution to a Peoria-themed compilation, If It Plays. In early '05, while recording it's first full length ('Out of a Center Which is Neither Dead Nor Alive') at Volume Studios, the band's producer Sanford Parker (PELICAN, UNEARTHLY TRANCE, RWAKE) joined on bass guitar, and the final lineup fell into place. Out of a Center?was released later that year on At A Loss. 2006 saw the band touring from coast to coast in support of Out of a Center? performing with acts as diverse and inspiring as BRUTAL TRUTH, HIGH ON FIRE, BORIS, SUNN0))), TORCHE, PIG DESTROYER, RWAKE, ASSCHAPEL, and BARONESS. Overwhelming press in the likes of Kerrang, Decibel, The Village Voice, Punk Planet, coupled with the band's work ethic and ground-shaking live shows generated an excitement that carried over into SXSW 2006 and the Emissions from the Monolith Festival. By mid-year, MINSK signed with Relapse, and the sophomore full length was underway. The summer and fall found the band pouring over new material and hammering out their Relapse debut, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment at Volume Stduios once again w/ Parker at the helm. Transcending the current crop of heavy music imitators, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment bleeds MINSK's tribal convictions with an atmosphere of total psychedelic delirium. Hypnotic percussion thunders beneath thickly layered guitars as synths and samples provide a backdrop for searing melodies and deeply spiritual vocal ruminations. Superbly produced by bassist/vocalist Parker, The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is a profound and provocative experience that will have an intense and lasting impact on all who dare approach.. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment has moved MINSK further into the world of the psychedelic and the progressive. Perhaps more organic and musical than the previous efforts, The Ritual Fires?delves deeper into sophisticated tribal motifs, vocal melodies, and psychedelic passages. Deeply passionate lyrical ruminations about personal struggle, mental illness, societal and generational guilt, the suicidal urge, and philosophical destruction and re-growth echo the sentiments of the varying moods and textures of the hour-long journey. The Ritual Fires of Abandonment is scheduled for release by Relapse Records on February 20, 2007. Early tour plans include a trip to SXSW 2007 and an April East Coast tour with brothers/label mates RWAKE. Also in the works are a split 7"" of Roky Erickson covers with label mates UNEARTHLY TRANCE."

Aeternus stands as the creators of an extreme music-style that is defined best as dark metal.
Fast, aggressive, intense and brutal, yet calm and beautiful at times. The lyrics within the realm of Aeternus are to be dark as the music. Thoughts and emotions are usually the main key element behind their darkened lyrics. Bringing up atmospheres of warriors and battles and the mystic and mighty powers of nature. 
In 1994, Aeternus released their one and only demo: ""Walk My Path"", which sold around 400 copies in the underground scene.
In 1995 Aeternus signed a small contract with the Czech label [l=View Beyond Records], who later the same year released the legendary ""Dark Sorcery"" miniCD. This material led to the interest from various labels. In 1996, Aeternus decided to sign with the Dutch label [l=Hammerheart Records]. During the years Aeternus have released several albums and became a strong name in the metal scene worldwide.
Aeternus has always been an active live band and have become a well-established live act.
They have toured with bands such as Deicide, Mayhem, Red Harvest, Cannibal Corpse, Emperor, Aura Noir, Marduk, Behemoth, Limbonic Art, etc. After the 2001 album ""Ascension of Terror"", Aeternus departed with Hammerheart Records. Shortly after Aeternus' crushing performance on the Inferno Festival 2002, the band inked a 3-album deal with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Samoth]Samoth's[/url] [l=Nocturnal Art Productions]. Only one records was released under the NAP banner in the end.
In March 2006 the band released their 6th full-length album through new label mates [l=Dark Essence Records]. The album, entitled ""HeXaeon"" was recorded in Grieghallen Studios, June 2004 with the legendary Pytten as producer, but not released until 2 years later due to some unforeseen hurdles in the process. In February 2006 Erik also decided to throw in the towel after a good 13 years in the band. Shortly after Erik’s departure Aeternus re-emerged as a 4 piece band, introducing 2 new members to the world at the first live appearance in nearly 3 years at Hole In The [l=Sky Festival Bergen].

""Dol Guldur"", the third album, followed in 1997 and once again the lyrics were inspired by Tolkien themes. The EP ""Nightshade Forests"" was also released that year and contained songs that didn't make it on ""Dol Guldur"".

Adding catchy sloganistic socio-political lyrics to their brand of garage rock 'n' roll, the band soon explored wider musical horizons than most of their contemporaries, incorporating reggae, dub, rockabilly, hip hop and funk influences into their music and a whole lot more.

The US saw the second album ""[m=14959]"" released before the first to coincide with the band's first transatlantic tour in early 1979, and (like in Japan and in Canada) the first LP ""[m=24371]"" was soon repackaged with an updated track list and the addition of a free 7"" ""Groovy Times"" / ""Gates Of The West,"" which wasn't released separately. A year later, they were receiving worldwide acclaim with their classic double album ""[m=19382].""

Starting in 1982, the band went through lineup changes due to infighting, and ultimately disbanded in January 1986. Soon after Strummer's death, on March 10, 2003, the band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (Performer)."

Aeternus stands as the creators of an extreme music-style that is defined best as dark metal.
Fast, aggressive, intense and brutal, yet calm and beautiful at times. The lyrics within the realm of Aeternus are to be dark as the music. Thoughts and emotions are usually the main key element behind their darkened lyrics. Bringing up atmospheres of warriors and battles and the mystic and mighty powers of nature. 
In 1994, Aeternus released their one and only demo: ""Walk My Path"", which sold around 400 copies in the underground scene.
In 1995 Aeternus signed a small contract with the Czech label [l=View Beyond Records], who later the same year released the legendary ""Dark Sorcery"" miniCD. This material led to the interest from various labels. In 1996, Aeternus decided to sign with the Dutch label [l=Hammerheart Records]. During the years Aeternus have released several albums and became a strong name in the metal scene worldwide.
Aeternus has always been an active live band and have become a well-established live act.
They have toured with bands such as Deicide, Mayhem, Red Harvest, Cannibal Corpse, Emperor, Aura Noir, Marduk, Behemoth, Limbonic Art, etc. After the 2001 album ""Ascension of Terror"", Aeternus departed with Hammerheart Records. Shortly after Aeternus' crushing performance on the Inferno Festival 2002, the band inked a 3-album deal with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Samoth]Samoth's[/url] [l=Nocturnal Art Productions]. Only one records was released under the NAP banner in the end.
In March 2006 the band released their 6th full-length album through new label mates [l=Dark Essence Records]. The album, entitled ""HeXaeon"" was recorded in Grieghallen Studios, June 2004 with the legendary Pytten as producer, but not released until 2 years later due to some unforeseen hurdles in the process. In February 2006 Erik also decided to throw in the towel after a good 13 years in the band. Shortly after Erik’s departure Aeternus re-emerged as a 4 piece band, introducing 2 new members to the world at the first live appearance in nearly 3 years at Hole In The [l=Sky Festival Bergen].

5125,8304,319209,US,Foetus,Flow,2001,62.8,11,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock']","['New Wave', 'Industrial']","[b]Foetus[/b] is a main solo project and 'one-man band' of Australian polystylistic composer, multi-instrumentalist, experimental sound artist and producer [a=J.G. Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

165426,217246,1431104,US,Reel Big Fish,Cheer Up!,2002,62.45,18,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Ska', 'Punk']","A ska-punk band from Huntington Beach, California. Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

The album featured a guest appearance by Cypress Hill rapper B-Real. The band played Warped Tour 1999, Woodstock 1999, and Ozzfest 2000, and toured with Godsmack, Machine Head, and Powerman 5000.

Reveille's follow-up album, Bleed the Sky was released in 2001.

Also in 2001 the group received the Boston Music Award for ""Rising Star"" and then embarked on a tour with Static-X. The following year Bleed the Sky was nominated for Boston Music Award's ""Album of the Year"".

In 2002, their original guitarist, Greg Sullivan, decided to leave the band citing ""creative differences"". He was replaced by Chris Turner. Though initially announcing the band would be releasing a third album through Elektra Records, once again enlisting the help of producer Howard Benson, this album never saw release and they soon departed the label. Singer Drew Simollardes claimed Reveille had been pressured to make more accessible radio-oriented music by the label, stating ""Our biggest problem was always battling with people at the label. They were kind of trying to market us to 12 year old girls and it didn't work. That was our big problem with them.""[1] Reveille did one tour with Sevendust before breaking up in 2003.[2] Their final show was the ""3rd Annual Hometown Throwdown"" at the Palladium in Worcester, Massachusetts on December 28, 2002 where they performed two live new songs titled ""Your Life"" & ""Nothing No One"" that was originally supposed to be for their third album."

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

One of the Seattle grunge scene a-list bands, their star faded considerably when that scene fell out of fashion. 

This appears to have suited the band fine as they've continued to record increasingly experimental music with their line-up almost intact (they have had a number of drummers over the years - [a712166], [a518880], [a365506] and, now, the drummer who played on their original demos and with Temple of the Dog - [a284484], who also plays drums for [a=Soundgarden]. In 1995, they played as the backing band on [a=Neil Young]'s ""[m=38666]"" album and the subsequent tour.

Among the band members' many side projects over the years are [a=Brad] ([a377057]); [a=Mad Season] & [a888052] ([a275980]); [a=Three Fish] & [a2990495] ([a377056]); [a=The Wellwater Conspiracy] ([a284484]).

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

They are considered the parents of Tolkiean Black Metal. Two demos, ""Anno Mortiri Domini"" and ""Upon the Viking's Stallion"", were made the following year and soon the band was signed to Napalm Records where they released their first full-length album, ""Lugburz"", which featured Pazuzu, in 1995. After the release Trifixion was kicked out of the band and since then the band focused on keyboard elements rather than drums which was shown on the following album ""Minas Morgul"" which was also released in 1995. 

""Dol Guldur"", the third album, followed in 1997 and once again the lyrics were inspired by Tolkien themes. The EP ""Nightshade Forests"" was also released that year and contained songs that didn't make it on ""Dol Guldur"". After two years silence the band then released ""Stronghold"", which featured Tania Borsky, in 1999. ""Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame"" came in 2001 and was followed by the EP ""Lost Tales"" in 2003.

In 2006, Summoning released their 6th full-length album with the sort title ""Oathbound"". Summoning changed the guitar style and moved to a more opened, floating style in contrary to the staccato style of the album and used more choirs than before.

In 2011, Silenius got a heart infarction which nearly brought Summoning to an end, but with the psychical rehabilitation a new flame arose and Silenius started to compose new material along with Protector. In the year 2013, seven years after the last output, ""Old Mornings Dawn"" saw the light of day. The music of OMD got a much clearer sound, focusing more on details than before. The guitars got deeper and became more old school black metal styled than on all albums before.

It was enough to attract the attention of Elektra Records, who released their self-titled album the following July. Unfortunately for the band, however, Elektra's parent company, Warner Music Group, was sold in February 2004 to a group of private investors, who decided to fold Elektra into Atlantic Records, and many of the labels' underperforming acts, including Year of the Rabbit, were dropped from their rosters.

This change was made because while for most of the bands' career all the members were Christian, by the time they split in 2013 they had some non-Christian members.

[a266100] was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release."

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002.

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

The same night they were formed they also recorded their first demo, ""The Art of Dying"". It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

Initially formed as a death metal band Eczema in 1990 by bassist Wargod (Vegard Tønsberg Bakke), drummer Exhurtum (Carl-Michael Eide) and guitarist Lemarchand (Håvard Jørgensen). In September 1991 they changed name to Satyricon and in January 1992 Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) joined the group as vocalist. Satyr quickly became the driving force in the band and soon the other members either quit or were kicked out. In 1993 drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) joined the band and without few exceptions Satyricon has been a two-man force ever since. The core duo has however utilized various session musicians throughout the years for live situations and also for album writing purposes. 

Satyricon's early works were strongly characterised by medieval aesthetics and heavy use of folk music influences and ""Nemesis Divina"" can well be considered as the peak of this era and style. After this there was a clear change in the musical direction as the 1999's ""Rebel Extravaganza"" saw the band enter the industrial age with its cold, guitar driven and dissonant sound and overall more contemporary imagery. Since then Satyricon has been pushing the boundaries of traditional Norse black metal, not only by incorporating more heavy metal/rock elements into music, but also by becoming generally a more mainstream media figure in Norway. On their most recent releases the band has found its musical niche in their unique style of blackened heavy metal, which rely heavily on guitar riffs and often complex timings rather than keyboard laden atmospherics.

The same night they were formed they also recorded their first demo, ""The Art of Dying"". It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

Machine Head was started by the ex-""[a=Vio-Lence]"" member [a=Robert Flynn]. He recruited his roommate [a=Adam Duce] (bass guitar), long time friend [a=Logan Mader] (guitar) and drummer [a=Tony Costanza]. The band has been plagued by line-up changes and drug abuse since its inception. 

Though the band's first album was a success, Machine Head had a series of albums that earned the band criticism for ""selling out"". With 5 former members, the band nearly disbanded in 2002 after [a=Roadrunner Records] dropped them. The band re-signed soon after and had a stable line-up from 2003-2013, also including former [a=Vio-Lence] member [a=Phil Demmel]. In 2007 Machine Head recieved a Grammy Award nomination for their album ""The Blackening"".

As of 2013 the line-up became unstable again with the departures of 3 long-time members;
[a=Adam Duce] left in 2013 after 21 years
[a=Dave McClain] left in 2018 after 24 years
[a=Phil Demmel] left in 2018 after 16 years

In 2019 Flynn announced a 25th anniversary tour of the band debut album ""Burn My Eyes"", where the band would play 2 sets with 2 tour line-ups; one performing the ""Burn My Eyes"" record in its entirety featuring former members [a=Logan Mader] and [a=Chris Kontos] joining him and Jared, and another set where the band would perform other MH songs, with Robb and Jared being joined by guitarist [a=Wacław Kiełtyka] (of [a=Decapitated]) and drummer [a=Matt Alston] (of [a=Sanctorum]).

252732,8092,800154,Europe,Misfits,Famous Monsters,1999,53.62,22,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Heavy Metal', 'Horror Rock']","The Misfits are an American horror-themed punk rock band from Lodi, New Jersey. Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois. The Event flyer read, ""They Said It Would Never Happen... The Original Misfits."""

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

His first collection of poetry, [i]Let Us Compare Mythologies[/i], was published in 1956, followed by [i]The Spice Box of Earth[/i] in 1961. After traveling throughout Europe, he settled on the Greek island of Hydra, where he stayed for seven years.

In 1967, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk musician. In 1994, Cohen retreated to the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles, beginning what became five years of seclusion at the center. In 1996, Cohen was ordained as a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk and took the Dharma name ""Jikan"", meaning ""silence"".

During his lifetime he recorded 14 studio albums.

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Live achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album Throwing Copper, which sold eight million copies in the U.S. The band had a string of hit singles in the mid-1990s including ""Lightning Crashes"", which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995.

Known as ""Van the Man"" by his fans, Morrison started his musical career as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, penning their seminal 1964 hit ""Gloria"". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career. (In 1966 he moved to the USA, first to New York City. In 1968 he lived 9 months in Cambridge near Boston. Early Autumn 1968, he recorded Astral Weeks in New York, then moving to Woodstock. In the spring of 1971 he moved to California, settling in the leafy Marin County town of Fairfax, where he built his own Caledonia Studios. Morrison has moved house a lot. By 1977 he's living in Brentwood near Los Angeles, later it's Sausalito, ... Morrison would revisit Ireland and the UK, e.g. buying a house in Bath, England.)

Van Morrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2000, Morrison ranked #25 on American cable music channel VH1's list of its 100 greatest artists of rock and roll, and in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Van Morrison 42nd on their list of The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The Craving was originally released in 1996, however, it was remastered in 2004 when Dave Mustaine remixed & remastered the Megadeth back catalog. The remaster does not include Lee Ving's original vocal tracks or harmonica parts due to the master tapes being lost. So, instead of tracking down Lee and re-recording his vocals and harmonica, Dave did the vocals and simulated the harmonica on guitar.

The MD in MD.45 is Dave Mustaine's initials backwards and the 45 is Lee Ving's reversed initials in Roman numerals.

Dave Mustaine, wanted to create an album showcasing a different musical style than Megadeth. 

MD.45 History

The first (and only) album released was The Craving in Japan first on May 29, 1996 and in other nations on July 23, 1996.

Almost a decade later, while Capitol Records was releasing remastered versions of Megadeth's back catalog, Dave Mustaine chose to remaster The Craving. According to the liner notes, during the remastering process, it was realized that the vocal track and harmonica track were missing.

To complete the remaster,  Mustaine chose to do the vocals himself and simulate the harmonica parts on the guitar.

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family.

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Formed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Los Natas put the second largest South American nation on the world's stoner rock map almost single-handedly. Coming together in the mid-90's, guitarist/vocalist Sergio Chotsourian, bassist Miguel Fernandez and drummer Walter Broide displayed a distinct Kyuss obsession on their 1996 debut Delmar, which was sung almost exclusively in Spanish. But subsequent releases such as 1999's Ciudad de Brahman and 2002's Corsario Negro (featuring new bassist Gonzalo Villagra) quickly expanded upon this oft-borrowed blueprint, adding sonic elements culled from space rock, psychedelia and even jazz, meshing and elevating them all to heights arguably never scaled south of the Equator. Not content to sit on their laurels, the group's 2003's Toba Trance delved into Indian music over the course of three songs spread over sixty-minutes.

In those early days, Charlie Lowell and Dan Haseltine were joined by [a=Matt Bronleewe] after discovering they shared similar musical tastes, and began working on various studio projects as well as performing with different college bands. In 1993, Stephen Mason was accepted into the college due to the strength of his audition piece 'Frail' (then an instrumental guitar track), and met Dan because of a Toad The Wet Sprocket t-shirt he was wearing, the two sharing an admiration for that band's unique sound. This original foursome then decided to write and record a song together purely for credit in a recording class. That song, 'Fade To Grey' became popular throughout the college, and the band performed it the 'Underground Cafe'. After the success of this performance, they decided to write more songs to add to their repertoire as well as to continue satisfying their course criteria. They also decided that if they were going to continue performing, they needed to give themselves a name. Charlie recalled a verse from 2 Corinthians 4:7 that included the phrase 'Jars of Clay' and the band decided that this would be a good way to remind themselves to stay humble. In 1994, Jars of Clay was born.

Also in 1994, Charlie suggested to the band that they enter a talent contest he had seen advertised in a CCM magazine. On April 27th, Jars of Clay performed at the Gospel Music Association Spotlight Competition, and met with great popular and critical praise. April continued to be busy as the band released its demo album ""Frail"", (which was limited to a run of 1000 and is now the most highly sought after piece of Jars of Clay memorabilia). This demo, combined with their GMA win, garnered the band a lot of record label interest, and eventually they signed with [l=Essential Records (3)], then a small, fledgling label that nevertheless had the distribution power of both Brentwood Music and Silvertone. By this stage, Matt Bronleewe had decided to leave the band and continue his studies, rather than move with the others to Nashville to record their debut album. This left a hole in the group that was filled when Charlie called an old school friend of his, Matt Odmark, and asked him if he would be interested in the spot. Matt accepted and in May 1995 they released their self-titled debut to massive critical and popular acclaim. The first single to be lifted from the album, 'Flood', became a No. 1 hit on both secular and Christian charts, helping the album go 2x Platinum, and seeing the band tour with the likes of Sting, Sheryl Crowe, Michael W. Smith and PFR.

Jars of Clay are considered to be one of the most creative and artistic bands in the US, and not only amongst Christian audiences. Though their name is not as prevalent in the secular scene as it once was, it is still associated with the very highest of production values and creative output, and the band still maintains a very loyal and dedicated fan base, and have performed all over the world, including Australia, the UK, the Philippines, and Singapore. In 2001, Jars of Clay received Honourary Degrees from Greenville College, since Dan, Charlie and Steve never finished their original degrees. The band has always been open about their Christian beliefs, but do not consider themselves to be a 'Christian' band, more a band whose members are Christians. All four men are now married and most have started families of their own. When touring, the group is expanded to include a drummer (formerly Scott Savage and [a=Joe Porter (2)], currently [a=Jeremy Lutito]) and a bassist (formerly [a=Aaron Sands], currently [a=Gabe Ruschival]), and on occasion has included string players. Jars of Clay continue to be one of the most influential bands in the CCM industry as well as maintaining a high degree of respect in the music industry in general."

One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

273827,106119,1767648,US,Overkill,ReliXIV,2005,50.65,10,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Thrash', 'Speed Metal']","Speed/Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from New Jersey (USA).

The band known for rejecting several names, which includes ""Virgin Killer"", this new band finally settled on ""Overkill"", naming themselves after a [a233658] album.
Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

After the release of the demo ""Horror Infinity"" the band was signed to German Nuclear Blast Records where their first release was the debut album, ""Imperial Doom"". However, there where some disagreements with the label and eventually the band left the label. 

Two years after the release of the demo ""Slaves and Masters"", in 1994, the band was signed to Conquest Music and released their second album ""Millennium"" in 1996 (ironically licensed by Nuclear Blast for the European market). The album was a huge succes and the band then embarked on various tours to promote it. After the release and tours George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher left the band to become a member of Cannibal Corpse. He was replaced by Jason Avery. The band then returned to the studio to record their third album. The result was ""In Dark Purity"" which was released in 1999. 

In 2001 the band returned with the double disc album ""Enslaving The Masses"" which contained remixed songs from past albums (all vocals by George Fisher) on disc one and live songs from various shows on disc two. Unfortunately, Jason Avery had to leave the band because of personal reasons. He was replaced by Sam Molina. In 2002 former tour-only member Patrick Hall (guitar) re-joined the band as permanent member. 

In 2003 former vocalist Jason Avery also re-joined the band. Sam Molina didn't quit but instead he became second guitarist. Same year they recorded and released their fifth album, ""Rise To Power"", which was recorded at Audio Hammer studios in Sanford, Florida.

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer].

During 2007-2008, Oranssi Pazuzu wrote songs using means of repetition and improvisation, fusing together various influences ranging from Black Metal to Space Rock. These early songs were recorded in Korjak's family cabin in the late summer of 2008 and released as the group's debut album Muukalainen puhuu by Violent Journey Records in April 2009.

In 2009-2010, Oranssi Pazuzu played shows around Finland and continued to write music that twisted itself towards darker and more aggressive moods. Sometime in early 2010, the band became friends with Marko Neuman (aka MN), a Finnish underground musician, who had an idea of a split album with Neuman's band Candy Cane. In September 2010, Oranssi Pazuzu played their first concerts outside Finland in Germany and the Netherlands. In November 2010, the Candy Cane / Oranssi Pazuzu split was released as a co-operation of two labels Firebox and Verdura Records.

Kosmonument, their second full-length album, was recorded in the old Karhu Manor in March 2011. MN acted as an artistic advisor, while Sami Jormanainen engineered the recordings and the mixing. The band described Kosmonument as a concept album that would summarize the musical ideas of cosmic darkness they had been developing ever since their debut album. In May 2011, Start Records released a vinyl version of Muukalainen puhuu and during the summer the band made a deal with Spinefarm Records regarding their future album. Kosmonument was released on 26th October 2011 as a CD by Spinefarm Records and as a double-lp by Blackspin Music.

259856,12573,2779618,Germany,Borknagar,Empiricism,2001,50.03,10,['Album'],['Rock'],['Viking Metal'],"Progressive metal band from Bergen, Norway.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

In 1994 Draugluin (guitar) joined the band and they soon began working on a demo. A lot of material was made but without a drummer it was tough doing it. But in 1995 their first demo ""Ved Ferdens Ende"" was recorded even though they still didn’t have a drummer. After the release Berserk left the band. They finally gained a drummer, Torvus, in 1996 and their second demo ""Possessed"" was recorded. After the release Torvus was kicked out and replaced by Desecrator. Also Diabolus Mort (guitar) came home to Norway after 4 years in the US and joined. 

In 1997 the EP ""Throne Of The Goat"" was recorded and released on Solistitium Records. A year later Nag was in the army and Diabous Mort and Desecrator lost interest in the band. Nag and Draugluin were once again alone, but continued writing material. They were joined by Blod (drums) of Gehenna and Arak Draconiiz (guitar) of Isvind. The promo ""Atum Nocturnem"" was released in 1999 by At War Records. After the promo Drakkar Productions and End All Life Productions got in touch with Tsjuder, and a deal for two albums and tours was signed. At the end of 1999 ""Kill For Satan"" was recorded and in 2000 it was released.

As the band was ready to go on their first tour Blod left because of time limits and was replaced by Anti Christian. After the release of ""Kill For Satan"" Arak Draconiiz moved away from Oslo, and was replaced by Paal. In 2001 Anti Christian had to leave the band because of tendinitis in both arms and Paal also left the band because of his work. Jontho (drums) of Ragnarok then joined the band and together they recorded ""Demonic Possession"" which was released in 2002.

Split up in 2006 after the release of their last regular album ""Desert Northern Hell"" and a live DVD called ""Norwegian Apocalypse"".

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Forming in 1999 as Sw1tch, the band played shows around Ohio and released a demo entitled Fuckin' Demo. The songs ""Anymore"", ""Wrongside"", ""Inside"", ""Darkening Days"", ""Last Chance"", and ""Skins"", which appear in their demo versions on this CD, went on to appear on the Subject to Change album. This demo was later re-released on disc two of the ""Ghosts in the Machine"" album in 2006. Since a funk band already had rights to the name Switch, the band had to change their name to Sw1tched, and was later signed to Immortal/Virgin Records. After recording all of the bass for the Subject to Change album, bassist Shawn May left the band for unknown reasons, and was replaced by Chimaira drum tech Jason French. French did play bass on one song on the album, though, since the band re-recorded the song ""Walk Away"" before the album was released.

Switched rose to prominence playing at popular festivals such as Ozzfest in 2002 and on the Vans Warped Tour in 2001 and 2002. Their debut album titled, Subject to Change was released via Immortal/Virgin Records in 2002, and went on to sell over 100,000 records worldwide.

In mid-2003, the group severed ties with both their label Immortal Records and their former management team. Bassist Jason French was replaced by former [a=Stuck Mojo] and [a=Stereomud] bassist [a=Corey Lowery], who would eventually leave the band to join Dark New Day. During the recording phase for their second album, they had planned to adopt a new name, Sky Fall Down, by January 2004 – a reflection on the new direction the band was taking. Instead, the band went on a two-year hiatus, with several members of the band moving on to other projects.

Former bassist Shawn May, who had left the band in 2001 prior to the release of ""Subject to Change"", started a custom bass shop in Michigan. Drummer Chad Szeliga joined Leo in 2004 and then later joined popular post-grunge group Breaking Benjamin in 2005. Bassist Corey Lowery helped form alternative metal group Dark New Day, and later formed Eye Empire. Lead guitarist B.C. Kochmit joined then left hard rock group ""Rikets"" to form his own projects, called ""Tinjen"", ""Shambella"", and ""My Alter-Ego Experiment."" He was the lead guitar player in Dark New Day for a short time, and Eye Empire with Lowery and is currently a member Nonpoint. Vocalist [a=Ben Schigel] found success as a producer working with bands such as [a=Drowning Pool (2)], [a=Chimaira], [a=Breaking Benjamin], Rikets, [a302867] and Allele.

With help from their first manager, [a=Thom Hazaert], now co-president of Californian indie label, Corporate Punishment Records, the group reformed (with a modified lineup) and released their second album titled, Ghosts in the Machine on January 10, 2006. The two-disc album contains rarities, b-sides and demos. The first disc includes eleven tracks that were intended for the band's second Immortal release, while the second disc includes four live songs plus several demos and the unreleased track ""She Blinded Me with Science"". The quality of the first disc can be described as ""rough"" as the tracks weren't yet mastered and still in the demo phase.

A repackaged version of Subject to Change was also released which features the b-side track ""Spread"", the Howard Benson produced alternate versions of ""Walkaway"" and ""Inside"" and the Rick Will mix of ""Inside"". Two videos for ""Inside"" are also included.

Switched declared a second hiatus after Ghosts in the Machine but as of January 2010, according to [a=Ben Schigel], there are no plans to continue with Sw1tched.

Bassist Corey Lowery and guitarist B.C. Kochmit have since formed hard rock supergroup Eye Empire with solo artist Dixie Duncan and former members of Submersed singer Donald Carpenter and drummer Garrett Whitlock."

Mitchell and Greig were then almost immediately replaced by former [a1057516] drummer Frank Beard and Billy Etheridge respectively, finalising their classic line-up when Dusty Hill, another former member of American Blues, replaced Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units.

Biography:
Pulse Ultra was initially formed as Head Space in 1997 by guitarist Dominic Cifarelli and bassist Jeff Feldman. Drummer Maxx Zinno was added that same year, followed by vocalist Zo Vizza two years later.

Pulse Ultra's break came in 2000 when the band met Taproot, with Cifarelli later passing on one of their demos to the band. Taproot guitarist Mike DeWolf, through their management team Velvet Hammer, later got the band signed with Atlantic Records.

After a year of songwriting, the band issued their debut album Headspace on July 16, 2002. The band would appear on the Ozzfest tour that year in support of the album's release. Subsequently, the album failed to push the band into the mainstream. In early 2004 the band went back to L.A. to work on the follow up to ""Headspace"". A few months into pre-production, Atlantic Records merged with AOL/TIME/WARNER. This resulted in Pulse Ultra being dropped due to minimal record sales.

At some point during mid-2004, tensions grew between the band and Zo, which soon after would lead Pulse Ultra to look for a new vocalist. In a post on the band's official forum, Zo stated that the split was amicable and they were all on good terms. Despite finding a replacement in Lukas Rossi, the band would disband shortly after. They are now all involved in other projects. Dominic Cifarelli (guitarist) released his debut solo project The Chronicles Of Israfel in 2007."

A few rehearsal tapes were made and members were kicked. In 1999, after more were kicked out, Malefic found a person called Mike. They did a split MCD with Orosius. Mike handled drums and vocals while Malefic took care of guitar and bass, but due to lack of funding and only 20 minutes of recording it was not worthy of being distributed. After that incident Mike left. 

In 2001 Xasthur became a one-man project.

On August 28th, 2009, Malefic announced that he would release albums on his own label called Disharmonic Variations, and Xasthur will never release split releases anymore.

On March 26, 2010, Malefic announced that ""Portal of Sorrow"" would be the final Xasthur release and that his next project would be outside the metal genre.

In 2015 Scott announced that the name Xasthur will be used for his new acoustic project.

Playing in local Chicago punk clubs, the group self-released their debut album, ""Mo' Money, Mo' 40'z"". The band got their first real break when front man Tony Lovato sent the band's album to Goldfinger's John Feldmann who helped them get signed to Maverick Records, and produced their major-label debut, ""Wasting Time"", which was released in July 2000. Since then the band has released three more albums on Maverick —2001's ""Destination Unknown"", 2003's self-titled disc, and 2005's ""Photographs""—and toured the world as part of the Warped Tour.
Tensions between the band members about the musical direction of the band, growing up, starting a family and not wanting to tour as much caused the band to break-up in 2006, and Mest announced their breakup, as well as a farewell tour entitled ""So Long and Thanx for the Booze"".
After spending some time off, Lovato was inspired to start writing music again. He joined up with new guitarist Mike Longworthand new drummer Lil Rich Gonzales. The end result was a series of pop-punk songs that paid tribute to Mest's past, but pushed the band forward into the future. They released a new album, ""Not What You Expected"". Lovato asked Tom Denney from A Day To Remember to co-write a song with him. The track is ""Radio (Something To Believe)"" and is an ode to all the bands that the duo grew up listening to. Jeremy, from A Day To Remember, jumped in the studio to record a part for the song."
137126,67195,990163,US,Testament,First Strike Still Deadly,2001,48.77,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Thrash'],"Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from San Francisco, California (USA).

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

251657,12646,897713,US,Sodom,M-16,2001,48.52,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Thrash'],"German four-piece speed/thrash metal band, regarded as very influential to the modern black metal scene.

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

242890,331232,2849694,US,Paths Of Possession,Promises in Blood,2005,48.0,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Death Metal'],"Formed in 1999 by Randy Buttman (Silhaven), Jay Fossen, Erin ""Goat"" Fuller (Cryptic Winds) and Richard Brunelle (ex-Morbid Angel), as Swollen, Paths of Possession is a solid mix of traditional heavy metal with influences of Swedish melodic death metal. Paths of Possession independently released their first CD-r demo, Legacy in Ashes, in 2000.

Following the release of Legacy of Ashes, Erin left the band to join Hell on Earth and was replaced by Brian Ridley (Cancerslug) in 2002. Soon after, Paths of Possession was approached by Keith ""Splattergod"" Suchland (Splattergod Records, Eviscerated Zombie Tampon) about releasing their next CD. It was mutually decided that they and Dark Faith would release a split EP, with each band contributing six songs.

While working on the split, Buttman was asked to join Withered Earth in late 2002, officially doing so in January 2003, resulting in the band going on hiatus and the split being put on hold. Following the release of Withered Earths' Of Which They Bleed, the band broke up and Buttman returned to Tampa and set about resurrecting the dormant Paths of Possession.

As their then vocalist, Bill, had relocated to New York, Buttman asked his friend, George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher (vocalist of Cannibal Corpse) to take over the vocal position. The new line-up then opted to record their six songs in Ozone Studios, St. Petersburg, Florida, finishing in September 2003. The result was entitled The Crypt of Madness and released on Splattergod Records, limited to 1000 copies. Plans were then made between the band and Splattergod to release their full length CD in late 2004 / early 2005.

Soon following the split's release, in early 2004, Richard Brunelle was replaced by current guitarist Jack Goodwin, and drummer Brian Ridley left to rejoin Cancerslug. Nick Goodyear (Dark Faith) stepped in to take over the drumming duties. Paths of Possession debuted their new/current lineup at the second Gathering of Lowlifes Festival on April 9 2005, appearing with the newly reformed Hallow's Eve as well as Dark Faith, Gardy Loo and Eviscerated Zombie Tampon.

It was also during this time that Metal Blade Records owner Brian Slagel, after hearing The Crypt of Madness, approached Fisher about signing Paths of Possession, which came about in 2005. Paths of Possession entered Mana Recording Studios / Razzor Media in St. Petersburg, Florida to record Promises in Blood, with renowned metal producer Erik Rutan. 

They followed this up with 2007's ""The End of the Hour"".

After the release of the demo ""Horror Infinity"" the band was signed to German Nuclear Blast Records where their first release was the debut album, ""Imperial Doom"". However, there where some disagreements with the label and eventually the band left the label. 

Two years after the release of the demo ""Slaves and Masters"", in 1994, the band was signed to Conquest Music and released their second album ""Millennium"" in 1996 (ironically licensed by Nuclear Blast for the European market). The album was a huge succes and the band then embarked on various tours to promote it. After the release and tours George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher left the band to become a member of Cannibal Corpse. He was replaced by Jason Avery. The band then returned to the studio to record their third album. The result was ""In Dark Purity"" which was released in 1999. 

In 2001 the band returned with the double disc album ""Enslaving The Masses"" which contained remixed songs from past albums (all vocals by George Fisher) on disc one and live songs from various shows on disc two. Unfortunately, Jason Avery had to leave the band because of personal reasons. He was replaced by Sam Molina. In 2002 former tour-only member Patrick Hall (guitar) re-joined the band as permanent member. 

In 2003 former vocalist Jason Avery also re-joined the band. Sam Molina didn't quit but instead he became second guitarist. Same year they recorded and released their fifth album, ""Rise To Power"", which was recorded at Audio Hammer studios in Sanford, Florida.

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

The band has taken a long road to its way to succeed: after releasing 3 records and touring around in Hungary for many years, Ektomorf took the chance to go international, bringing their heavy grooves and harsh lyrics for all the people around the globe. The mix of groove, thrash, hardcore and traditional gipsy music got recognized by many, and success was provided by their legendary energetic and destructive stage performances – wich made Ektomorf not only the most famous hungarian metal-act, but also one of the leading artist in their genre. Signed by Nuclear Blast, producing their hit albums like ’Destroy’, ’Instinct’ and ’Outcast’ it was proven that Ektomorf can’t go wrong with their powerful, groovy style, and kept on walking the same line while adding more melodies and traditional accoustic elements, proving their critics that there’s a next level to elevate to. After changing record label and getting signed by AFM Records the band released their 2010 recording ’Redemption’, wich was another relentless manifestation of the monster what’s being feeded by anger, hate and social criticism, with a touch of human soul.

As part of their passion project, and searching for something unusual, they've produced one of the most interresting record, wich showed a rarely known side of the band – ’The Accoustic’ presented a suprise for the fans of groove metal by being an experimental album consisting covers, new and old songs written and re-recorded „unplugged”.

		

This step has helped the quartett to reach out to their non-traditional fanbase - with a couple of exclusive accoustic shows and radio performances the Ektomorf was again in the spotlight. Taken from that album, the video of ’To Smoulder’ took a rise being played daily in mainstream media.

Later that year Ektomorf released their new album, wich follows the traditional way for the band – but still some new elements reaching surface on it. ’Black Flag’ offers 50 minutes of massive grooves, unforgetable melodies, and new, even more sophisticated sound – courtesy of Tue Madsen, Ektomorf’s long time producer and friend, who travelled to Hungary in a sake for recording yet another masterpiece in the band’s home studio.

In January 2014 the band will release their new studio album, titled as ‘RETRIBUTION’. Again, with producer Tue Madsen the hungarian groove-metal beast continues to impress with its huge sound and intense, powerful songs, wich many of the press already labeled as their best album so far. 14 tracks of brutal honest songs, presumably many of them will be huge hits on any dancefloor or live event!

Earthshaking grooves with a critical, energetic message – Ektomorf will break down all the walls and unite people on the dancefloor around the world, from the smallest clubs to the biggest festivals.

From the very beginning, Indukti was an instrumental band, although they have had a period when they were searching for a vocalist. The lack of proper candidate, did not stop them from being successful.
In 2003, they received Grand Prix during the first edition of BIG STAR FESTIVAL. A year later, their debut album entitled S.U.S.A.R. (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) was released which, to a large extent, was inspired by Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. During the making of the album, the band cooperated with vocalist Mariusz Duda and harpist Anna Faber.
In 2005, thanks to Laser’s Edge label, the album made its way to the shops all over the world. In the same year, the band received the journalists’ award during UNION OF ROCK festival. 2 years later, the band participated in Mexican BAJA PROG and American NEARFest festivals.
In 2009, thanks to German InsideOut Music, a second album of the group entitled “Idmen” was released. Its content is an allegory of human struggle with destiny, faith, everyday life, nature and himslef. The title of the album was taken from Homer’s Odyssey.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

Not to be confused with Angel Dust (later Asmodina) from Darmstadt who released a demo in 1985.

The band is led by vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Blackie Lawless. They arose out of Los Angeles's glam metal scene and gained notoriety for their over the top stage shows, which included the band throwing raw meat into the audience, scantily clad women on stage, and Lawless's spark-shooting codpiece.  

The group's first single, ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" brought further infamy.  

The band was commercially successful throughout most of the 1980's but also caught the attention of parent's groups, most significantly the PMRC.  Lawless continues to record and tour under the W.A.S.P. banner with various line ups. 

In the 2000s, he reclaimed the Christian faith of his youth and subsequently began toning down his stage shows and censoring some of the lyrics to some of his older, more explicit songs during live performances.  

He has also publicly stated that he will no longer play ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" due to his religious faith."

Gustafson left before the recording of their first LP, Grimaldi was replaced by Jason Viebrooks, and the band went on to record two albums of groove-thrash metal in the early Machine Head vein with that line-up.
After the second album ""Nemesis"" was released in 1997, Viebrooks also left, and was replaced by Canadian bassist Stuart Carruthers for the recording of their third album ""Solidify"" (1999), before more or less naturally dissolving since the members were involved in other activities.

At this point, Lombardo is concentrating on the Fantomas project, and Sorychta has been busy producing bands like Tiamat, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering. 

The band never really disappeared though, and in 2004 they released a new album called ""Incorporated"" with Sorychta filling in on bass duties.

Formed in 1998, the band released one full-length studio album in 2003 and disbanded in 2005 after their guitarist, Andrew Howard, was found dead. Twisted Method was founded in 1998 after its band members met each other at Mariner High School. The band signed a five-year, $5.5 million contract with MCA Records in 2002, the label issuing the band's debut album 'Escape from Cape Coma' in July of the following year, the title a sarcastic reference to their home town.

Band members described their home town as a place where ""old people retire"" such that ""it's like the walking dead"". Geffen Records, who had recently been acquired by MCA Records, bought the band a spot on the second stage of the 2003 Ozzfest tour. Despite being in contract limbo for quite a while, things were looking up when Geffen indicated they would finance a second album, even putting them on tour with Dope twice in 2004 and recording demos in June with Edsel Dope. They toured with Dope and Motograter in 2004 as part of the American Apathy tour.

In July 2005, Twisted Method went on an ""indefinite hiatus"" after guitarist Andrew Howard and drummer Ben Goins had quit the band. Howard left because he wanted to be with his family after becoming a father, and Goins ""left the band for God"".

Andrew Howard was found dead on Friday afternoon of September 16, 2005. He was only 23 years old. Over four years after his passing, his death still remains unsolved. Remaining Twisted Method members, Derrick Tribbett and Derek DeSantis formed a new metal group named MakeShift Romeo.

(Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.) The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years.

The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.

Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers. Another noteworthy aspect of W&C's sound is the absence of drums.

They recruited French singer Guillaume Bideau and together they took the band to new heights, releasing the critically heralded album ‘Passenger’ in early 2007.

Relentless touring and hard work got them to the point of a well-respected metal band, but their big break came when they got a chance to open for the mighty Metallica. They played their hearts out during this gig in Denmark and pleased the gods of heavy so much that they were asked to open on a leg of Metallica’s European summer tour.

Stephen Swesey joined as keyboardist shortly after, and they recorded the Foreshadow 7"" with Gar Wood at his garage in December. The single was released the following spring.

In 1998, Tristeza toured the U.S. extensively in support of the 7"", while fine-tuning songs for the recording of their first LP. In the Autumn of 1998, ""Spine and Sensory"" was recorded by Tim Green at his Louder Studios in San Francisco. Makoto Recordings released the album in April of 1999, while the band toured in its support. Also released in 1999, were the ""Insound Tour-support Series Vol. 1"" EP-CD and the ""Macrame 7"". Both were recorded with Mike Hammel at his Last Time Around Studio in Los Angeles. These releases were limited and sold out during tour.

In April of 2000, the group took two weeks off, mid-tour, to record their second full-length album ""Dream Signals in Full Circles"" with producer Dave Trumfio at his King Size Sound Labs, in Chicago. Tiger Style Records released the album in September of that year, and again, the group toured for the remainder of the year promoting it. ""Dream Signals..."" was well received around the world, and in the early months of 2001, Tristeza headlined tours in Europe and Japan for the first time.

After the ""Dream Signals..."" tours, the group took time off from performing to record some experimental material with Matt Anderson for release on his Gravity label. The ""Mania Phase"" 12"" and the ""Mixed Signals"" remixes collection were released early in 2002. Tristeza toured the U.S., Japan, and Europe, once again, for the promotion of these releases. Prior to these tours, Stephen Swesey left the band, and was replaced by tour keyboardist Eric Hinojosa.

At the beginning of 2003, James LaValle played his last gig with the group in order to focus on his Album Leaf project full-time. The group took time off from performing live, and James Lehner moved back to Michigan for a while. Peace and solitude was necessary for Lehner as he preparred for and adjusted to fatherhood. A good amount of time was also needed for the other members to rest and regroup while searching for 2 new members. The band chose to release another 12"" on Gravity. ""Espuma"" features songs previously unreleased, live material, and the first song recorded without LaValle entitled ""This Trap"". The last two months of the year were spent rehearsing with the assistance of friend Mitch Wilson on guitar, and demo versions of 4 songs were recorded with Pall Jenkins at his home studio.

In 2004, Tristeza began writing and rehearsing a second batch of songs for the new album with Keyboardist Sean Ogilvie. His musical background and training made him a perfect fit in the band. The new songs were very complex arrangements with odd time signatures, consequently Mitch recommended his good friend Alison Ables as a potential guitarist. Also an old friend of the group, Alison had no trouble whatsoever learning the new songs, and finally, mid-way through the year, Tristeza had its new line up.

The band has gone through countless line-ups and many former members have gone on to become significant figures in a variety of musical scenes.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles. This line-up lasted until 2004, when Jesse Pintado left the band. Currently the band consists of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and Danny Herrera.

In December 1997 the band was put on a permanent halt as Nödtveidt was arrested for killing a man earlier that year. He was later sentenced to 10 years in prison for assistance to murder and illegal possession of a firearm.

In 2003 Nödtveidt announced the comeback of Dissection and the renewed band eventually returned to the stage on October 30th, 2004 at the Arenan in Stockholm. Soon after the release of their third album “Reinkaos” on April 30th, 2006, Nödveidt announced the end of Dissection as he “had reached the limitations of music as a tool for expression and with Reinkaos they had managed to manifest a truly Satanic record and the work of Dissection had been done. Now it was time to move on to other realms of practice.” Their final concert was performed on June 24th, 2006 at Hovet, Stockholm. About two months later, on August 13th, 2006, Jon Nödtveidt committed suicide.

Music-wise, Dissection combined various styles of extreme metal with a strong melodic sensibility and a sinister/melancholic atmosphere. Despite often being considered death/black metal, the band themselves refused such categorization and typically referred to their music as Metal of Death, or Anti Cosmic Metal of Death.

The same night they were formed they also recorded their first demo, ""The Art of Dying"". It received positive reviews and in 1993 they returned to the studio to record their second demo, ""Into the Frozen Shadows"". This led to a deal with No Fashion Records. In 1994 they recorded their debut album ""Kiss the Goat"" and released it in 1995. A lot of great reviews and tours followed. In 1996 they once again entered the studio to record ""Enter the Moonlight Gate"". It was released in 1997 and, of course, more tours were arranged. 

In 1998 the third album ""Unholy Crusade"" was recorded and released the following year. After several tours and gigs Niclas Andersson decided to leave the band in 2000. He was replaced by Fredrik Wester. The band then returned to the studio to record ""Angelgrinder"" and before recordings were done Niclas Andersson returned. In 2002 the album was released and the band then embarked on a tour called ""Angelgrinder Tour"". Shortly after Fredrik Wester was forced to leave the band. 
The band decided to officially split-up in January 2009. The main reason for this is a hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for Micke in the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band, but instead mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future. They eventually reunited with the original line-up a year and a half later.

On November 18th, 2015, the band announced the following on their Facebook page: ""We have decided to cancel all our coming live shows due to health issues and lack of motivation within the band. Only time will tell if we ever decide to start playing live again. No interviews will be answered.""

The band continued touring and Micke Backelin took a break and was temporarily replaced by Daniel Moilanen and Niclas Andersson once again left the band. During the recordings of the new album Micke returned and Daniel left. The MCD ""Scythe of Death"" was released in 2003. In 2004 the fifth album, ""The Seal of Belial"", was released.

They were active from 2001 to 2003 before breaking up, releasing two albums.

History
Stereomud released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. 
After extensive touring in support of that album, they went back into the studio, releasing Every Given Moment in April 2003. 

After participating in the Jagermeister Music Tour with P.E., Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, a mere 3 months after the release of Every Given Moment. 

They have performed a few select reunion shows since this, but for the most part, the band remains dormant to this day. Recently, it was rumored that Erik Rogers and Corey Lowery would reunite to reform the band, but the possibilities may not be true as they are focusing on their own bands. 

It is planned that a Stereomud DVD will be released at some point in the future. Erik Rogers changed band name to 'Dangerous New Machine' with a new lineup February 2009.

Band members:
    * Erik Rogers - vocalist (subsequently in Soundevice, Love Said No and Dangerous New Machine, currently in My Therapy)
    * Corey Lowery - bassist (previously of Stuck Mojo and Switched, currently in Dark New Day)
    * Dan Richardson - drummer (previously of Crumbsuckers and Pro-Pain and Life of Agony)
    * John Fattoruso - guitarist ( Now in Black Water Rising )

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched. Same year recorded the MCD called ""Ex Inferis"" at the Ballerina Studio. It contained a new studio track, a cover and three previously released tracks. 

In 2003 they released ""Sheol"" which gained them major success.

Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles.

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

259856,12553,368624,,Borknagar,Borknagar,1996,44.13,10,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Black Metal', 'Viking Metal']","Progressive metal band from Bergen, Norway.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Then called Downside, the quartet -- vocalist Eric Victorino, guitarist Ryan Hernandez, bassist Hrag Chanchanian, and drummer Adrian Robison -- started playing out frequently, and by 2001 had self-released an LP. An Internet release followed. Tours with homeboys like Alien Ant Farm and Dredg raised Strata's stock, and though numerous labels showed interest in their post-grunge grooves (similar to types like Trapt or even Hoobastank), the band eventually signed with mondo-successful startup Wind-Up. 

Their largely self-produced, eponymously titled debut appeared in July 2004. Presents the End of the World followed three years later. The trio spent the next two years writing songs while touring the U.S. and U.K., then returned to hit the studio and record Strata Presents the End of the World, released in July 2007. 

In 2008, after Victorino announced he had left the band, Strata called it a day. Victorino went on to form the electronic-pop duo the Limousines while Hernandez and Robison formed the group Beta State.

In 2014, the band reunited, minus Adrian Robison on drums, replaced by long time friend of the band Andy Bailey who played with the band until 2019 after which the drums were played by Jim Leadbetter. In 2017 Jonathan Poso joined the band on piano and synthesizer.

Since reuniting, the band released a new six-song EP called 'The Sawmill Sessions' on March 8, 2016, a 10 year anniversary edition of 'Strata Presents The End Of The World' in 2017, and have started releasing new music through bandcamp as of 2020.

As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren.

They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"".

The latter were transformed entirely when [a10360] from [a10343] met up with them, and formed Ash Ra Tempel. 

The trio of Göttsching / Enke / Schulze decided to abandon conventional composition and songwriting in favour of free-form improvising and developing a new musical language. As such, they became notorious for jams that could exceed 30 minutes (some such recordings can be found on [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1406291-The-Private-Tapes]The Private Tapes[/url] releases). Ash Ra Tempel went to Hamburg in March 1971 to record their debut, with the aid of top engineer [a40135]. A Krautrock twist on the space-rock music as pioneered by Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, with elements of both yet devoid of songs. One track per side: the power-drive storming ""Amboss"" and the shimmering timeless ""Traummaschine"". A yin-and-yang type concept that was followed on further albums. 

Schulze departed after the band's debut, with lots of other musicians passing through the group for their second album Schwingungen. The record had psychedelic blues numbers on one side, and a deep space trip on the other. The same concept appearing on the similarly balanced Seven Up collaboration with acid guru [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/21068-Dr-Timothy-Leary]Timothy Leary[/url].

Schulze returned for the band's 4th album Join Inn, in 1973.

Hartmut soon left the band and abandoned music altogether, leaving Göttsching to keep the band-name going, with the duo project Starring Rosi, the cosmic guitar album Inventions For Electric Guitar, and the album New Age Of Earth, after which Ash Ra Tempel were re-branded as [a49639].

67153,28076,419524,Europe,Clawfinger,Clawfinger,1997,43.53,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Industrial Metal'],"Metal band formed in Stockholm, Sweden. They are considered to be genre pioneers.

Formed in 1989 by four co-workers at the Rosenlund hospital, Clawfinger comprised of Jocke Skog (b. 3 June 1969, Stockholm, Sweden; programming, vocals), Zak Tell (b. 16 November 1970, Stockholm, Sweden; vocals), Erlend Ottem (b. 13 December 1968, Molde, Norway; guitar) and Bård Torstensen (b. 13 September 1961, Arendal, Norway; guitar). They immediately received international praise for their fluid but powerful alternative rock sound. Their debut single, 1993's ""Nigger"", also provoked great controversy. Although the subject matter was profoundly anti-racist, many critics wondered as to the wisdom of its title. The media quickly categorized Clawfinger alongside American outfits such as Rage Against The Machine, who similarly combined political activism with a musical scope that ranged from hardcore rap to metal. The band's debut album, Deaf Dumb Blind, expanded their repertoire to encompass funk and even jazz flourishes. It was promoted in the USA on tours with Anthrax and Alice In Chains, while Clawfinger remained rooted in their national charts with a joint EP with Swedish rappers Just D. In 1995 the band, now expanded to a six-piece with the addition of André Skaug (b. Sunndalsøra, Norway; bass) and Ottar Vigerstøl (drums), launched their ""Back To The Basics"" European tour, which saw them play in 12 European countries within a few weeks.

The band took a break before starting work on their self-titled third album, which featured session drummer Henka Johansson (b. Karlskoga, Sweden).

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

In those early days, Charlie Lowell and Dan Haseltine were joined by [a=Matt Bronleewe] after discovering they shared similar musical tastes, and began working on various studio projects as well as performing with different college bands. In 1993, Stephen Mason was accepted into the college due to the strength of his audition piece 'Frail' (then an instrumental guitar track), and met Dan because of a Toad The Wet Sprocket t-shirt he was wearing, the two sharing an admiration for that band's unique sound. This original foursome then decided to write and record a song together purely for credit in a recording class. That song, 'Fade To Grey' became popular throughout the college, and the band performed it the 'Underground Cafe'. After the success of this performance, they decided to write more songs to add to their repertoire as well as to continue satisfying their course criteria. They also decided that if they were going to continue performing, they needed to give themselves a name. Charlie recalled a verse from 2 Corinthians 4:7 that included the phrase 'Jars of Clay' and the band decided that this would be a good way to remind themselves to stay humble. In 1994, Jars of Clay was born.

Also in 1994, Charlie suggested to the band that they enter a talent contest he had seen advertised in a CCM magazine. On April 27th, Jars of Clay performed at the Gospel Music Association Spotlight Competition, and met with great popular and critical praise. April continued to be busy as the band released its demo album ""Frail"", (which was limited to a run of 1000 and is now the most highly sought after piece of Jars of Clay memorabilia). This demo, combined with their GMA win, garnered the band a lot of record label interest, and eventually they signed with [l=Essential Records (3)], then a small, fledgling label that nevertheless had the distribution power of both Brentwood Music and Silvertone. By this stage, Matt Bronleewe had decided to leave the band and continue his studies, rather than move with the others to Nashville to record their debut album. This left a hole in the group that was filled when Charlie called an old school friend of his, Matt Odmark, and asked him if he would be interested in the spot. Matt accepted and in May 1995 they released their self-titled debut to massive critical and popular acclaim. The first single to be lifted from the album, 'Flood', became a No. 1 hit on both secular and Christian charts, helping the album go 2x Platinum, and seeing the band tour with the likes of Sting, Sheryl Crowe, Michael W. Smith and PFR.

Jars of Clay are considered to be one of the most creative and artistic bands in the US, and not only amongst Christian audiences. Though their name is not as prevalent in the secular scene as it once was, it is still associated with the very highest of production values and creative output, and the band still maintains a very loyal and dedicated fan base, and have performed all over the world, including Australia, the UK, the Philippines, and Singapore. In 2001, Jars of Clay received Honourary Degrees from Greenville College, since Dan, Charlie and Steve never finished their original degrees. The band has always been open about their Christian beliefs, but do not consider themselves to be a 'Christian' band, more a band whose members are Christians. All four men are now married and most have started families of their own. When touring, the group is expanded to include a drummer (formerly Scott Savage and [a=Joe Porter (2)], currently [a=Jeremy Lutito]) and a bassist (formerly [a=Aaron Sands], currently [a=Gabe Ruschival]), and on occasion has included string players. Jars of Clay continue to be one of the most influential bands in the CCM industry as well as maintaining a high degree of respect in the music industry in general."

Punk band from Boston, MA, formed in 1996 by Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar) and Mike McColgan (vocals).  The band is known for its Oi!/punk sound, its frequent covers of Irish standards, and lyrics which often focus on unions and working class ethics and concerns.  In 1998, the band signed to [l=Hellcat Records], a label run by members of [a=Rancid] and connected to [l=Epitaph Records].  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.  The split was amicable and McColgan would return to music a few years later, fronting the [a=Street Dogs].  He was replaced by Al Barr.  Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old [a=Woody Guthrie] poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".  It remains perhaps their best-known song.

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

The two had jammed together since fall 1993 and wanted to start a band. Christer's brother Peter, 14 was recruited for vocal duties. 
Bassist Eystein Holm joined on 17 May 1994 as the band was rehearsing for a show that day. 
In an interview, Peter explained the band's name: ""Extol means to exalt, to lift up what you give glory to, and that's what's we're all about. 
We want to give God all the glory with our lives and with our music."" 
Extol wanted to expand their musical style beyond regular heavy metal music to show more of a progressive side. 
The style change necessitated another guitarist, a position Emil Nikolaisen of the band Royal filled in 1995.

The group soon garnered a reputation in the local scene. 
In January 1996, Extol made their first record appearance on a Norwegian metal compilation called Northern Lights. 
The album featured other local Christian artists Antestor, Schaliach, and Groms. 
Steve Rowe of Australian Christian metal band Mortification released the compilation on his record label, Rowe Productions. 
The band ventured to Stockholm, Sweden two months later for their first show outside their homeland. 
At the end of 1996, Nikolaisen departed so he could devote more time to Royal, and was replaced by Ole Børud of Schaliach and Arnold B Family.

In 1997, Extol released an independent three-song demo: Embraced. A studio album ([r24468086]) was recorded at the end of the year even though a record label had not signed them. 
Almost a year passed before Endtime Productions picked up the band. 
Their debut album, Burial, was released in December 1998. 
The album was licensed in the United States on Solid State Records, and in Japan on Avalon Records. 
Critical reception was very positive from Christian and secular publications.

Hotwire included guitarist/vocalist Rus Martin, guitarist Gabe Garcia, bassist Dan Hartman, and drummer Brian Borg. The four came together after playing in various metal, punk, and hardcore combos throughout high school. As Hotwire, the sound became riff-heavy metal with vocals and dynamics influenced by post-hardcore types like Refused and Quicksand. The band recorded a few demos, and began playing shows throughout the suburban sprawl of Southern California alongside bands like Incubus, Linkin Park, Hoobastank, and Audiovent; all of which would find fame on major labels looking for the next loud thing. Soon, Hotwire got its chance, as well, and signed with RCA in December 2000. After working with a variety of big-name producers, the band issued a promotional four-song EP in late 2002. The set generated buzz for Hotwire’s debut full-length Routine, which dropped in June 2003. Its release was timed to coincide with the band’s appearances on that summer’s Ozzfest.

Soon after The Routine was released, band went on hiatus and disbanded. Vocalist Rus Martin joined alternative rock band Skyscraper Frontier and guitarist Gabriel Garcia formed The Transfatal Express, both under Coming Home Records.

Danzig morphed out of the goth punk band Samhain after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin. Rubin was interested in working with Glenn, but not with Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group. Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von and guitarist John Christ and for drums Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. The original line-up recorded band’s first four albums, but during the mid-90’s the group started to disintegrate with first Chuck Biscuits leaving the group and soon after John Christ and Eerie Von followed. At the time Glenn also came at odds with producer Rubin and his label and the two ended collaborations as well.

Following the line-up turmoil Glenn took distance from the blues driven heavy metal that Danzig had become known for and introduced strong industrial sound on “Danzig 5: Blackaciddevil”, a move that was not received well by fans or critics. After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band returned to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, but have not managed to recapture the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records had.

Current line up: 
Glenn Danzig - Vocals (1987– )

In 1997 they recorded their first demo, ""Septic Vomit"". Shortly after Jared received throat cancer and was forced to leave the band. He was then replaced by Leon del Muerte. ""From Here to Colostomy"", the second demo, was released in 1999 which featured Sean handling both guitar and bass. Ron's replacement was Tom Persons of Enthroned but his stay was short as he left soon. Ross Sewage (bass, vocals) of Exhumed then took his place and eventually became a permanent replacement. Same year they also did a split 7"" EP with Cephalic Carnage. 

The band played several gigs and in 2000 they released their first full-length album, ""The Dead Shall Dead Remain"", along with the 7"" split with Engorged and shortly after the band then went on a tour with Nile and Incantation.

They were soon joined by [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thyme+(2)]Thyme[/url] (vocals) and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rym+(2)]Rym[/url] (guitar) and then they recorded their first demo entitled ""Pagan Land"". The demo was recorded in a studio called Haga Audio which unfortunately didn't have any experience with Black Metal so it didn't turn out good and the response wasn't that good either. In 1995 the band recorded the song 'Et Vinterland I Nord' which was going to feature on a compilation CD for local bands in Sarpsborg. It turned out to be great so the band sent out the song to various labels and media. The response was positive so they re-recorded the demo in a different studio called X-Ray Studios and this time it turned out to be great and shortly after they were signed to [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Head+Not+Found]Head Not Found[/url] Records. They soon entered the studio once again and recorded their debut album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/767493]Nattferd[/url]"" which was released same year. They also played their first gig right after the release. 

In 1996 the band was unsatisfied with the label so they decided to leave them but the label quickly offered them a better deal and then they were re-signed for two more albums. They also played at the famous Elm Street bar in Oslo together with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Old+Man%27s+Child]Old Man's Child[/url] and shortly after [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Century+Media]Century Media[/url] wanted to sign them but they had to say no because of the contract with their label. In 1997 they entered the studio to record their second album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/388046]Arising Realm[/url]"" which featured [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shagrath]Shagrath[/url] of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dimmu+Borgir]Dimmu Borgir[/url] on keyboard. In 1998 they went on their first tour with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Siebenb%C3%BCrgen]Siebenbürgen[/url] from Sweden and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Atanatos]Atanatos[/url] from Germany and played one gig in Denmark and seven in Germany and they also played at ""The Hellraiser Festival"" in Leipzig, Germany. 

At the end of the year recordings for the third album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/767503]Diabolical Age[/url]"" began and this time it took place in Endless Studio in Oslo. The following year, during the mixing, which had to be done five times, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thyme+(2)]Thyme[/url] left the band because of other interests. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rym+(2)]Rym[/url] had also come up with new material and thought it would be best with another guitarist so Sander of Shadow Dancers became a member. In 2000 they finally found a replacement for [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Thyme+(2)]Thyme[/url], his name was Astaroth. Shortly after ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/767503]Diabolical Age[/url]"" was finally released and the band then played at ""Under the Black Sun Festival"" in Germany. The band was shocked at Sanders poor performance and kicked him out of the band when they got home. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lord+Arcamous]Lord Arcamous[/url] was asked to join them for a tour which was together with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Satanic+Slaughter]Satanic Slaughter[/url] of Sweden. It was a self-financed tour and it was also tough for the band since Rym was forced to stay home. The pressure showed that Astaroth wasn't the right man for the band so he was kicked after the tour was over. The contract also ended so the band searched for a new label. 

In 2001 [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lord+Arcamous]Lord Arcamous[/url] became a full-time member and also took over vocals and the band also sent out material to labels and were soon signed to Swedish label [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Regain+Records]Regain Records[/url]. They then entered Abyss Studio and recorded the album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/388050]In Nomine Satanas[/url]"" which was engineered by [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tommy+T%C3%A4gtgren]Tommy Tägtgren[/url]. In 2002 the album was released and the band then went on tour with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dark+Funeral]Dark Funeral[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Anorexia+Nervosa+(2)]Anorexia Nervosa[/url], Occult and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tidfall]Tidfall[/url]. It turned out to be one of the worst tours ever arranged. Problems constantly occured and after the tour was over [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lord+Arcamous]Lord Arcamous[/url] left the band. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jontho]Jontho[/url] took part in playing drums on [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tsjuder]Tsjuders[/url] album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/540664]Demonic Possession[/url]"" and also played with them at ""Under the Black Sun Festival"" in Germany.

He then asked him if he wanted to play with Ragnarok. After the tour he did the vocals for a [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Celtic+Frost]Celtic Frost[/url] cover and it turned out great and he then became a member of the band.

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

In 1999, the band independently released their self titled EP (referred to as ""The Green Album""). At this time, they were also opening for bands such as Amen, Disturbed, Nickelback and Nothingface.

They later signed with Arista Records, where they released two major label albums in One Nation Under (which features many re-recorded songs from their self titled album) (2001) and My So-Called Life (2003). They had two music videos which are for their songs ""Check Ya"" and ""Smack"", both of which can be viewed over on You Tube. Before the recording of My So-Called Life, bassist Rob Ruccia left the band to do production work on other bands, leaving vocalist Jett to record the bass for the album. They later recruited Avi Kopernik to play bass for the group's live shows.

After being dropped by Arista less than a month after the release of My So-Called Life, they went to work preparing for their third album. As time went on, writing music became a chore and Jett with nothing to fall back on, needed to concentrate on a day job to support his family. Joe Pettinato, who already had a construction business, then left the band, and the rest of the group called it quits in 2005.

The band formed in 1968. Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some band members believe that their music cannot be categorised as belonging to any one genre. They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as ""the loudest pop group"", and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

There has been a Deep Purple band in existence since the late 60s, apart from the eight years between 1976 when Mark IV split up and 1984 when Mark II reformed.

Founded in 1993 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Immolation was formed in 1986 as Rigor Mortis by Andrew Sakowics (vocals, bass), Thomas Wilkinson (guitar), Robert Vigna (guitar) and Dave Wilkinson (drums). In 1987 they recorded the demos ""Decomposed"" and ""Warriors of Doom"". In 1988 Andrew Sakowics and Dave Wilkinson were replaced by Ross Dolan (vocals, bass) and Neal Boback (drums). They recorded another two demos, both entitled ""Immolation"". Later that year they changed name to Immolation and the compilation album, ""Stepping on Angels...Before Dawn"", containing the demo albums, was released. 

In 1991 Neal Boback was replaced by Craig Smilowski and then the band recorded and released the album ""Dawn of Possession"" through Roadrunner Records. Five years passed and ""Here in After"" was released. During those years they also split from Roadrunner Records and were signed to Metal Blade instead. Alex Hernandez also replaced Craig Smilowski on drums. The band then embarked on several tours and in 1999 ""Failures for Gods"" was released. It was followed by ""Close to a World Below"" in 2000. 

Bill Taylor (guitar), formerly of Angel Corpse, was recruited for touring but became a permanent member. In 2002 ""Unholy Cult"" was released."

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently between that time and their break-up in 2011. Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.

Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 (Performers) and Roxy Music frontman [a87721] was awarded a CBE by Her Majesty the Queen of England on 30 November 2011.

Roxy Music have released 28 albums and 38 compilations since the band’s inception back in 1971. Of these, 18 have made the ‘UK Top 40’ music charts with 11 of them reaching the ‘Top 10’ and 4 albums reaching the No.1 position. The albums to hit the top spot are ‘[m=58357]’ (Dec 1973), ‘[m=41847]’ (May 1980), ‘[m=58313]’ (Jun 1982) and ‘[m58362]’ (Apr 1986). These four albums cumulatively spent 13 weeks at the No.1 position. All 18 charting albums, have in total, been in the chart’s Top 10 for 76 weeks and within the Top 40 for 260 weeks.

Similarly, Roxy Music have had success with some of their 49 single/EP releases. In this case, there has been a chart entry for 18 of these releases, with one single making the No.1 spot. In February 1981, Roxy Music hit the singles chart 'top spot' with the John Lennon composed song ‘[m=58331]’ and spent 2 weeks at that coveted position, 9 weeks in the chart’s Top 40 (6 weeks in the Top 10) and 11 weeks overall.

The 18 Roxy Music hit singles/EPs have spent time in the UK Top 40 music charts for 128 weeks, with 44 of these within the Top 10. The single with the most time in the UK Charts is ‘[m=58323]’, which entered the charts in April 1979 and overall spent 14 weeks charting.

Roxy Music’s first album to enter the UK Charts was the self-entitled ‘[m=58135]’ (Island ILPS9200) making its debut on 29/07/1972.  It stayed in the charts for 16 weeks with its highest position being no.10. The album briefly reappeared in February 2018 under the HDCD release (Virgin ROXYCD1) for one week reaching no.47.

Their music is distinguished from many earlier nu-metal groups with its greater focus on vocal harmonies, and correspondingly less elements of hip hop than groups like Limp Bizkit or Puya.

In 1999, the band independently released their self titled EP (referred to as ""The Green Album""). At this time, they were also opening for bands such as Amen, Disturbed, Nickelback and Nothingface.

They later signed with Arista Records, where they released two major label albums in One Nation Under (which features many re-recorded songs from their self titled album) (2001) and My So-Called Life (2003). They had two music videos which are for their songs ""Check Ya"" and ""Smack"", both of which can be viewed over on You Tube. Before the recording of My So-Called Life, bassist Rob Ruccia left the band to do production work on other bands, leaving vocalist Jett to record the bass for the album. They later recruited Avi Kopernik to play bass for the group's live shows.

After being dropped by Arista less than a month after the release of My So-Called Life, they went to work preparing for their third album. As time went on, writing music became a chore and Jett with nothing to fall back on, needed to concentrate on a day job to support his family. Joe Pettinato, who already had a construction business, then left the band, and the rest of the group called it quits in 2005. Two songs from the intended album, ""Middle of the Road"" and ""My Own Destiny"", can still be streamed on their official PureVolume page.
Although they have not gained widespread popularity within the music community as a whole, they are well recognized both in the Chicago area and among nu metal fans."

Coal Chamber are led by gruff vocalist Dez Fafara and operate in territory somewhere between the traditional hard riffing of Black Sabbath and the sensationalist techno rock of Marilyn Manson. Fafara met guitarist Miguel ""Meegs' Rascon through a classified ad, and they later added drummer Mike Cox and bass player Rayna Foss, the room-mate of Fafara's future wife.

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002. The band was further unsettled when Cox departed the same September. Coal Chamber split in 2003.

SKINLESS exploded onto the metal scene in 1992. Despite a variety of lineup changes, the songwriting team of Noah Carpenter (guitars) and Sherwood Webber (vocals) has remained constant since 1994. After adding the talents of Bob Beaulac (drums) and Joe Keyser (bass) SKINLESS established a solid, dedicated line-up, recorded two demos and appeared on numerous compilations.

In 1998, SKINLESS released their full-length debut 'Progression Towards Evil.' Recorded at Max Trax Studios in Albany, NY 'Progression...' stunned the underground, showcasing the musicianship and energy that the band had become known for via its intense live performances. An entirely independent release, 'Progression...' received frenzied acclaim from press the world over and saw remarkable sales. SKINLESS embarked on three immensely successful tours in support of 'Progression...' introducing legions of fans to the punishing live SKINLESS experience. The band toured the US with underground legends MORTICIAN on 1999's Chainsaw Tour, and in the Spring of 2000, SKINLESS toured the U.S. and Mexico with INCANTATION, spawning even more followers of the brutal underground revolution. Their subsequent European headlining tour claimed further disciples.

On their Relapse debut 'Foreshadowing Our Demise,' SKINLESS painted violent pictures of utter devastation. 'Foreshadowing Our Demise' sonically documented the endless energy of the band's burly live performances, delivering an annihilating combination of punishing grooves and ultimate brutality. SKINLESS' gut-twisting deathgrind deluged listeners with colossal riffs, chaotic percussion and Webber's scathing vocal attack. SKINLESS toured as much as possible in 2001/2002, being personally invited to hit the road with the likes of HATEBREED and SIX FEET UNDER, thus furthering their growing following.

In 1995 Cheeroth was asked to leave during the recording of the 7"" EP ""För Dem Mitt Blod"". They were then signed to Napalm Records where they released their first full-length album, ""Nord"", in 1996. After the release Zathanel left the band. 

Same year the band encountered line-up problems and Mysteriis and Kraath, who also took over bass duties, were the only members left. They eventually recruited Choronzon (guitar) and Moloch (drums). In 1997 they released their second album, ""Lords of the Nightrealm"" which was followed by a European tour with In Battle and Malignant Eternal. In 1998 Mysteriis took over drum duties since Moloch decided to leave the band. Kraath then switches to guitar and session member Sasrof (bass) is brought into the band along with Wrath (vocals). The band then recorded ""Hell Eternal"" at Abyss Studio. 

""Hell Eternal"" is released in 1999. In 2001 Sasrof leaves the band but is replaced by the returning Zathanel. In 2003 they released their last album on Napalm Records, a compilation album entitled ""From the Ancient Ruins"".

The origins of the group came from a collaboration between vocalist Daniel Higgs and bassist John Chriest where Chriest would create sound collages and loops for Higgs' poetry readings.  The duo eventually hooked up with guitarist Asa Osborne, who had done a stint in the hardcore band [a=Reptile House (2)] with Higgs and after briefly working with another drummer, they added Mitchell Feldstein to the group.  Early on, Higgs decamped for San Francisco, leaving the band's future in doubt.

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

SKINLESS exploded onto the metal scene in 1992. Despite a variety of lineup changes, the songwriting team of Noah Carpenter (guitars) and Sherwood Webber (vocals) has remained constant since 1994. After adding the talents of Bob Beaulac (drums) and Joe Keyser (bass) SKINLESS established a solid, dedicated line-up, recorded two demos and appeared on numerous compilations.

In 1998, SKINLESS released their full-length debut 'Progression Towards Evil.' Recorded at Max Trax Studios in Albany, NY 'Progression...' stunned the underground, showcasing the musicianship and energy that the band had become known for via its intense live performances. An entirely independent release, 'Progression...' received frenzied acclaim from press the world over and saw remarkable sales. SKINLESS embarked on three immensely successful tours in support of 'Progression...' introducing legions of fans to the punishing live SKINLESS experience. The band toured the US with underground legends MORTICIAN on 1999's Chainsaw Tour, and in the Spring of 2000, SKINLESS toured the U.S. and Mexico with INCANTATION, spawning even more followers of the brutal underground revolution. Their subsequent European headlining tour claimed further disciples.

On their Relapse debut 'Foreshadowing Our Demise,' SKINLESS painted violent pictures of utter devastation. 'Foreshadowing Our Demise' sonically documented the endless energy of the band's burly live performances, delivering an annihilating combination of punishing grooves and ultimate brutality. SKINLESS' gut-twisting deathgrind deluged listeners with colossal riffs, chaotic percussion and Webber's scathing vocal attack. SKINLESS toured as much as possible in 2001/2002, being personally invited to hit the road with the likes of HATEBREED and SIX FEET UNDER, thus furthering their growing following.

Disbanded: 2004

Despite their beginnings as a somewhat traditional death metal band Morgion had already completed its ascent into a fully fledged Death/Doom outfit by the time of their first album [r=1019457]. Further releases; 1999's [r=880449] kept the trademark slow tempos and growled vocals, but added delicate atmospherics and tones. 2004's [r=762023] proved to be the band's final album and can be seen as a progression on the latter. 

After disbanding, two members of the final line-up (Justin Christian and Rhett Davis) formed [a=Keen Of The Crow].

Morgion attempted to reunite the ""[r=880449]"" line-up for a one-off performance at the 2011 Maryland Deathfest, but postponed to the following year. They later dropped out due to member issues."
251657,12635,897021,Germany,Sodom,Code Red,1999,40.35,13,['Album'],['Rock'],['Thrash'],"German four-piece speed/thrash metal band, regarded as very influential to the modern black metal scene.

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

Five years passed and ""Here in After"" was released. During those years they also split from Roadrunner Records and were signed to Metal Blade instead. Alex Hernandez also replaced Craig Smilowski on drums. The band then embarked on several tours and in 1999 ""Failures for Gods"" was released. It was followed by ""Close to a World Below"" in 2000.

Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles.

The group started off as hardcore punk act and their 1983 self-titled debut scored an unexpected hit with the song ""Institutionalized"", which went into heavy rotation on the poplar SoCal radio station KROQ. It was a full two years later in 1985 when a video was produced and got heavy airplay on MTV. Meanwhile, in 1984 the group was banned from performing live in the city of Los Angeles, citing concerns about crowd violence. The ban remained in effect until the early 1990s. By the end of the 1980s, the band had evolved into a full-fledged thrash metal band and would soon begin adding more funk influences into their music. In 1995, the group announced their split, marking the end to their most commercially successful period. Mike Muir and Mike Clark would resurrect the band in 1996 with new members and the group continues to this day, although their recorded output has been sparse since reuniting. 

Throughout Suicidal's career, Muir has fronted a number of side-projects like [a=Los Cycos], [a=No Mercy (3)], [a=Infectious Grooves], and his own solo act, [a=Cyco Miko]. These acts have usually featured other members of Suicidal, as well."

The first and only demo was called ""Ungentle Exhumation"" and was released in the following year. In 1994 their first full-length was released, ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"", and it gained them succes and a good reputation in the underground. In 1996 they released the classic ""None So Vile"" which was a huge succes and surpassed other bands in terms of brutality. Sadly, Lord Worm left the band after the release. Michael DiSalvo (Infestation) later joined the band and he was the perfect replacement. After an impressive live show at the Milwaukee Metal Festival the band were signed to Century Media Records. 

With a new frontman and a record deal, the band recorded ""Whisper Supremacy"" which was released in 1998. They went on tours around the world and sales were up to 50,000 copies. Cryptopsy was becoming bigger and bigger and more live shows where played including the Dynamo Festival in Holland and several shows in Japan. 

After a wealth of tours the band returned to the studio and recorded ""And Then You'll Beg"" which was released in 2000. In August 2001, vocalist Michael DiSalvo was replaced by Martin Lacroix. In 2003 they released the live album, ""None So Live"", which was the last to feature Martin Lacroix as he left the band shortly after. His replacement was none other than the original vocalist, Lord Worm. In 2005, they recorded a new studio album entitled ""Once Was Not"". 

In 2008, ""The Unspoken King"" album marks the debut of Matt McGachy as well as the first and only appearance on a Cryptopsy album by Maggie Durand, as well as the band's departure from the death metal genre. The band instead perform deathcore on this album. 

After being on a record label for their entire career, Cryptopsy decided to go independent in 2012. Cryptopsy released independently the eponymous album on September 14, 2012. The album marked a return to their technical death metal sound.

In 2015, rather than a full album, Cryptopsy released the first instalment (Tome 1) of a series of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering. The band has said that The Book of Suffering Tome 1 is some of the most brutal, dark and technical music they have ever created."

Vomitory was formed in Sweden in 1989 by Urban Gustafsson (guitar), Ronnie Olson (bass), and Tobias Gustafsson (drums). In 1990, they played their first gig in their hometown of Forshaga. After the gig, Ronnie decided to concentrate on vocals, so Bengt Sund joined the band on bass. Bengt's friend Ulf Dalegren joined the band on guitar in 1991, and the band was now ready to record some material.

In 1992, they released their first demo, which got them in contact with Witchhunt Records. This led to the release of the 7"" single, ""Moribund"". Shortly after, Bengt Sund was asked to leave, before being replaced by Thomas Bergqvist. Labels had begun showing interest, so the band recorded a five track promo CD in the hopes of getting a record deal, but nothing happened. In 1994, they released the demo ""Through Sepulchral Shadows"", and in 1995 they went on a small, but successful tour through Poland.

In 1996, they inked a deal with Fadeless Records and released their debut album, ""Raped in Their Own Blood"". Following the release of the album, both Thomas and Ronnie left the band and were replaced by Erik Rundqvist (bass) and Jussi Linna (vocals). ""Redemption"" followed in 1999, along with two European tours, a split 7"" EP with Murder Corporation, and the 10"" LP entitled ""Anniversary Picture Disc"". In 2000, the band signed to Metal Blade Records and released their third album, ""Revelation Nausea"". However, prior to recording the album, Jussi Linna had left the group. Thus, Erik Rundqvist handled both vocal and bass duties. 

""Blood Rapture"" was released in 2002, and was followed by their fifth album ""Primal Massacre"" in 2004. Guitarist Ulf Dalegren departed in 2005, with Peter Östlund stepping in shortly after. With this lineup, the band released ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize"" in 2007, ""Carnage Euphoria"" in 2009 and ""Opus Mortis VIII"" in 2011. 

In February 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding, playing their final show on December 27, 2013. In 2017, the band reunited for one show to honor an old friend. On March 23, 2018, Vomitory officially reunited to celebrate 30 years since the band's formation."

Since 2018 there have been two versions of the band, one with classic members [a=Tracii Guns] and [a=Phil Lewis] and one with classic members [a=Steve Riley] and [a=Kelly Nickels]. In 2021, the incarnation with Riley and Nickels finally changed its name to [a=Riley's L.A. Guns] because of a lawsuit concerning the use of the band name.

L.A. Guns is an American rock band whose music is frequently associated with the L.A. glam metal scene which grew up around the Sunset Strip in the 1980s, in particular the sleaze rock subgenre. Guns N' Roses, which once featured three of the original L.A. Guns members, was the most prominent exponent of this subgenre, generally preferring an anti-social image to elaborate make-up and costumes. 

L.A. Guns was formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner.  Over the next couple years it would evolve into what became the original version of [a=Guns n' Roses].  Tracii Guns would depart that band in 1985 and launch a new version of L.A. Guns.  Throughout the years, a large number of musicians would pass through some version of the band (of which, at times, there have been two) and no single member would be consistently present at all times.  The band's longest-serving and best-known members are Tracii Guns, drummer Steve Riley (who joined the band in 1987 and is the closest thing to a constant member, having been in the band from 1987 until 1992, and again from 1994 until 2016), and vocalist Phil Lewis.  The L.A. Guns name is owned by both Tracii Guns and Steve Riley and both musicians have led their own versions of the band. Riley and Lewis led L.A. Guns from 1999 until 2016 while Guns had a second version of the band from 2006 to 2012.  In 2016, Lewis and Guns formed a new version of the band, while in 2018 Riley announced he had his own version which included one-time bassist Kelly Nickels.  In 2020, Lewis and Guns filed a lawsuit against Riley over the trademark to the L.A. Guns name after which a settlement was reached in which Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis would retained ownership of the L.A. Guns name while Steve Riley would use the name ""Riley's L.A. Guns"".

They formed in 2001 when singer Torry Jasper and drummer Jonathan Kelly began playing together after meeting in a high school English class.

In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they put some self-produced recordings on MP3.com where they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez. Within a few months they had a deal with Immortal Records and released their EP ""Change is the Only Constant"".

In 2005, they released their first full length album, ""An Offer You Can't Refuse"". In 2006 they released their latest album, titled ""Prepare The Masses"".

The band was on both the 2005 and 2006 Vans Warped Tours (often on the smaller Ernie Ball Stage). They were also at the 2006 annual music festival held in the Phoenix area, ""Edgefest"".

The original album ""An Offer You Can't Refuse"" was composed of all band members except Dan Parker who was added to the line-up. A Change Of Pace also goes by the acronym ""ACOP"".

On June 1st, 2008, the band revealed on their MySpace blog how original singer, Torry Jasper would be replaced by their good friend [a=Micah Bentley]. The change brought about a new sound, as well as a new EP entitled ""Just No Better Way."" The news comes merely weeks before A Change of Pace heads out on their summer tour.

After delays, the band put forth their final LP in February 22, 2011, entitled ""Couldn't Be Worse"". It incorporated both of their older and newer sounds. Shortly thereafter, on March 13, it was announced on their Facebook page that after 10 years, they would disband, but not before playing a farewell show on April 22 at The Clubhouse in Tempe, Arizona.

A Change of Pace mixed their own brand of metal, punk and emo.

Finntroll was established in 1997 by Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta (guitar) and Jan ""Katla"" Jämsen (vocals) who had the vision of fusing the darkness and grandeur of black metal with the traditional Finnish hoedown-music. Group's original line-up was completed in 1998 by Skrymer, Tundra, Trollhorn and Beast Dominator and their debut album ""Midnattens widunder"" was released in 1999. Altogether they have released six full lengths, the last one being 2013's ""Blodsvept"".

Despite being a Finnish band, Finntroll chose to write their lyrics in Swedish due to their original vocalist Katla being Fenno-Swedish.

In March 2003 Finntroll was struck by the tragic death of the guitarist Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

Growing up on the quieter streets of New Jersey, but with New York City just moments away, childhood friends Corey Mastrangelo (guitar), Grant Mayer (guitar/keys) and Derek Broomhead (drums) would spend their summer days running from punk shows to late night raves, living a dichotomous life that wormed its way into their music.
Forever too dancey for their post-rock peers, but too post-rock for their dance music friends, Vasudeva’s career to date has been spent on a tightrope, the tension between walking that fine line adding angst to their soaring tracks. On their new record, ​Generator​, however, things are different. There is a sense of peace and assuredness to the New Jersey trio - no longer three kids in their early-twenties trying to find their way, it feels like Vasudeva have finally found what they were searching for.
A seamless and soaring record, ​Generator​ sees Vasudeva truly completely comfortable in their own skin for what feels like the first time. Written, produced and engineered by the band over the course of three months in early spring with the help of their long-time friend Kevin Dye, it is an entirely personal, (almost) chronological time capsule of the band as they entered their late twenties; growing and evolving as people, their music following suit. There is a sense of a new beginning, a new chapter. Using Logic Pro X for the first time, Mastrangelo, Mayer and Broomhead were, for the first time, able to tap into their wide, varied set of influences; exploring textures, using midi and incorporating drum machines and synth sounds that they first fell in love with through their affinity for dance music.
Harnessing electronic drums and voice notes recorded by Mayer when commuting in New York City, using real keys and reel-to-reel tape machines, ​Generator​ masterfully blends the analog and the electronic. “Stockmar” sees Vasudeva at their most R'n'B inspired, the slowest track on the album showcasing their growth, yet named after Broomhead’s childhood street where the band spent endless amounts of time growing up. Things change, but they are always rooted in the past.
The record is undeniably textured, layers of instruments complementing each other - nylon strings piggybacking off piano chords in “Drop”, programmed bass sitting atop Broomhead’s ever fidgeting drums in “Yamaha”. Everything has its place, but nothing feels regimented. It’s a free-flowing feeling, a structured emotion.
There is an overwhelming emotional quality to the music Vasudeva creates, and in ​Generator​ this voice is at its strongest. While there are still the walls of sound that featured in previous works ​Life In Cycles​ and ​No Clearance​ (the ending of opener “Breaks” threatens to blow any speaker it is played through, and the breakdown in “III” provides one of ​Generators​ loudest moments), there is a much clearer focus on production, on texture, on feeling in this record. The SP-404 created “Only On” leaves you swirling and shifting as the EQ pans back and forth, creating a truly unique listening experience, transporting you underwater.
Obsessed with this level of production, ​Generator​ speaks to the notion of technology pushing Vasudeva forward in their everyday lives. Idle or not, we must push on.

The band was re-launched in 2015 by some of the original members and has since released one studio album on Alternative Tentacles.

Tsunami Bomb was formed in 1998 by bassist Dominic Davi and singer Kristin McRory (both ex-[a=Headboard]), with keyboardist/backing vocalist Oobliette Sparks and guitarist Tim Chaddick. Gabe Lindeman played drums with them but could not commit to joining the band permanently. McRory and Chaddick left later that year, and by early 1999 the lineup was rounded out with the addition of singer Emily Whitehurst (aka Agent M) and guitarist Brian Plink (both ex-[a=Plinky]), with drummer Robert Read. Their first release was the 'B-Movie Queens' split EP with Plinky (Plinky's only release). Read was replaced by Lindeman, and this lineup released two EPs, 'Mayhem On The High Seas' (1999) and 'The Invasion From Within!' (2001). Plink left and was replaced by Mike Griffen, while Sparks left and was not replaced.

Tsunami Bomb signed to Kung Fu Records and released their first album, 'The Ultimate Escape' (2002).

The band originally formed in 1989 as a solo project by Ixithra, alternately calling himself the Wicked Warlock Of Demonic Shadows or Lord Of The Sylvan Shadows. It would take three years before the cassette single [r=4725328] was released, and another two before their first full-length [m=318933].

During this time, constant changes in the lineup prompted Ixithra to temporarily abandon Demoncy and collaborate with former members of [a=Incantation] in the band [a=Profanatica], and to pursue other musical projects.

More low-fidelity recordings were eked out over the following years with lineup changes still a constant hindrance; two of these demo sessions were excerpted on the CD version of [r=2674286] in 1999.  That same year saw the release of [m=110792], a much-anticipated album that had originally been announced for release five years before. It received nearly universal acclaim and has attained classic status in some circles.

2003 saw the release of Demoncy's next full-length album, [r=1738145]; its slick production and more guttural vocal style were a distinct change from the raw and cold atmospheres of the earlier releases. This album led to tours across the US and Europe and appearances at several metal festivals. In 2004 the band was interviewed in the March issue of [i]Terrorizer[/i] magazine. This same year saw the release of a [url=http://www.discogs.com/Demoncy-Dark-Opus-Demoncy-Dark-Opus/release/1970444]split 7""[/url] with [a265883] from France.

The band entered the studio in 2005 to record the next album, but Ixithra was dissatisfied with the results and destroyed the recordings and fired his bandmates, leaving the status of Demoncy unclear. The band remained on hiatus until the release in 2012 of their fifth studio album, [m=514488].

17479,58431,392808,US,Bad Religion,The Process of Belief,2002,36.75,14,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Melodic Hardcore']","Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

[a=Bill Stevenson] soon hooked up with the duo as their drummer. At the end of 1977, Nolte became bass player for [a=The Last] and that group took precedent over David's commitment to the Descendents, so he was replaced by [a=Tony Lombardo], although David stuck around briefly to sing with the band. Their first release (as a trio at the time with Navetta and Lombardo handling vocals) was the [r=629008] 7"" in the style of melodic garage pop. After a six-month stretch with a female singer, [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/494063-Cecilia]Cecilia Loera[/url], they enlisted Stevenson and Navetta's classmate and a constant presence at Descendents' rehearsals, [a=Milo Aukerman], as a singer in late 1980, and reappeared as a 'proper' punk band, becoming a major player in the hardcore scene developing in Los Angeles at the time. 
Their debut album the following year, [r=630039], introduced an element of melody and sensitivity that set them apart from most other hardcore bands and Stevenson's songs in particular were to greatly influence the melodic punk-pop bands of the 1990s with themes of love and loss and alienation (themes far less common in the punk scene at the time). 
Following the album's release, Milo actually went to college to embark on an education that would take him as far as a doctorate in biochemistry. The band recruited [a=Ray Cooper (3)] to handle the vocals but at the same time Bill Stevenson became the drummer with fellow hardcore punks [a=Black Flag]. Although the plan was to play in both bands, Black Flag's rigorous touring scheduled proved to be too time-consuming. During this time, Descendents gigs were sporadic. There were a few gigs where the band appeared as a 5-piece, with both Navetta and Cooper playing guitar and Milo on vocals, and other shows by Lombardo and Cooper playing under the name Ascendents. The band did not record again until 1985, when they returned with the album [r=630066]. This was much more sensitive than ""Milo...,"" despite silly songs such as ""Pervert"" and ""No F.B"". 
The band's lineup changed around the time ""I Don't Want to Grow Up"". By the time of the recording, Navetta left the band to become a fisherman in Oregon and guitar duties were handled by Ray Cooper. Tony Lombardo left after the recording as touring was incompatible with his career as a postal carrier. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Doug+Carrion+(2)]Doug Carrion[/url] replaced Lombardo on bass. Lombardo has since stated that leaving the Descendents is the biggest regret he has in life. 
Their next album, [r=807910] (released in 1986) was not well received by critics, but fans liked it. It was a mix of more 'silly' songs (The last track on the album involving band members farting into microphones and laughing). 
After the Enjoy! tour, Ray Cooper got a job working in the emerging software scene and Doug Carrion left for other projects, eventually ending up in [a=Dag Nasty]. Stevenson invited [a=Stephen Egerton] and [a=Karl Alvarez] of Salt Lake City's [a=Massacre Guys] to replace them, and the now permanent line-up of the Descendents was in place. 
The group released the album [r=808983] in 1987, which, despite ""Van"", ""ALL-O-Gistics"" and the one-second ""ALL"", was the Descendents' most mature 1980's album, and featured emotional songs such as ""Coolidge"", ""Cameage"" and ""Clean Sheets"". 
With the release of ALL, the Descendents introduced to the world the driving concept behind their career's work, from which the album derives its title, the philosophy of ALL which they define quite conventionally as ""the total extent."" The idea of ALL as a concept beyond this conventional definition is one of endless self improvement. ""The total extent"" is an all-encompassing greatness, the pursuit of which is endless and impossible, but which is also the source of all real happiness. 
Milo left again in 1987 and the remaining Descendents reformed with singer [a=Dave Smalley] and reformed under the name [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/253329-ALL-2)]ALL[/url] and continued the legacy until 1996, when the Descendents reformed again with Milo Aukerman, now a full-time research biochemist, to record and tour in support of the album [r=429101]. 
In 2004 the band released the [r=813353] EP and their newest full length [r=528313], which is among their more emotional releases to date. Since then, the Descendents have sporadically performed live and have continued to work on new material when their schedules allow it. In 2002 and 2006, Stevenson, Lombardo, and Navetta got together to record the original songs the Desendents had written (predating ""Milo Goes To College"") and had never been recorded before (these recording were released as ""9th & Walnut"", a reference to the location of their old practice space, in the summer of 2021).  Navetta passed away in 2008 after a brief illness. In 2014, the band performed the entire ""Milo Goes To College"" album live with Tony Lombardo playing bass. Also, a documentary about the band, titled ""Filmage"" was released that same year."

Vocalist Frank Pellerin took over for Bouchard on 2003's Cease to Suffer. Later that year, the band signed with Victory Records. Still under contract to Cyclop Media, the band released the cover EP Rehearsal to fulfill their contract obligation. Their first full-length album for Victory was 2004's Unbroken.

After a few albums recorded with [a=John Goodmanson], they went into an unfamiliar studio with [a=Dave Fridmann] in late 2004, to record their first album for Sub Pop. In the summer of 2006, they announced an ""indefinite hiatus"", and they played their final U.S. gigs in August.

Later the same he eventually came back and as fulltime bassist. In 1996 they did a few live shows and shortly after Claus was kicked out of the band. 

In 1997 they were joined by Jacob Bredahl (vocals) who had heard they were looking for a new vocalist. They then recorded the second demo, ""Disconnected '97"", which showed great improvement. In 1998 the third demo, ""Spring'98"", was released and sent out to various labels, but nothing happened. In 1999 Frantz was kicked out and replaced by Mikael Ehlert Hansen. They also made a song for the compilation album, ""Extremity Rising Vol. 4"". 

In 2000 Jan was replaced by Ziggy and the band changed name to HateSphere. They also recorded their self-titled album, ""HateSphere"", which was released in 2001 by Italian Scarlet Records.

History
Stereomud released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. 
After extensive touring in support of that album, they went back into the studio, releasing Every Given Moment in April 2003. 

After participating in the Jagermeister Music Tour with P.E., Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, a mere 3 months after the release of Every Given Moment. 

They have performed a few select reunion shows since this, but for the most part, the band remains dormant to this day. Recently, it was rumored that Erik Rogers and Corey Lowery would reunite to reform the band, but the possibilities may not be true as they are focusing on their own bands. 

It is planned that a Stereomud DVD will be released at some point in the future. Erik Rogers changed band name to 'Dangerous New Machine' with a new lineup February 2009.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Agnostic Front's frontman Roger Miret would let his younger brother, Freddy ""Madball"" Cricien take the microphone on lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows and that is where it started.
Madball's first few gigs consisted of un-used Agnostic Front songs.

Upon founding the band consisted of 
Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and vocalist Freddy Cricien.
After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, would join the band. 

One year later Roger Miret left the band, and was replaced by bassist Hoya Roc — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band to play with.
The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown.

1995 saw the band participating in the N.Y.H.C. Documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29th, 1995 at the now defunct ""Coney Island High"". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year.

The band briefly broke up from early 2001 until late 2002. This lineup of Freddy Cricien, Hoya Roc, Mitts (ex-Skarhead), and Rigg Ross (ex-Hatebreed) began touring and recording at the end of 2002.  In 2004 they released their first output after they broke-up the ""N.Y.H.C. EP"" via small diy labels Thorp (USA) & GSR Records (Europe).

All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they reunited and would be working on a new album. They released their third and final album, Everything is Fine, in July 2019. On July 8th 2024, the band released a statement, confirming they have disbanded:   

""We posted recently that things were good and we suppose it was wishful thinking. We fought to keep it going but Much The Same has officially run its course and is disbanding. We want to thank all the fans, friends, bands, agents, and labels for over two decades of support that helped us take our band to stages we never imagined were possible.

Then, combing this with: rhythmically complex music, an amazing and entertaining live show, hard work, determination, and the maintaining of good attitudes towards everyone they come in contact with, one can see the basis for what Calico System is all about.

""Typical.” Never the word to be used when describing Calico System, a five-piece band hailing from the St. Louis area. Deftly defying the laws of musical implementation, Calico System confidently takes a variety of different elements from alternative-metal & hardcore and seamlessly fuses them with emo, groovecore and various other genres. And with a formula consisting of: rhythmically complex music, an amazing and entertaining live show, hard work, determination, and the maintaining of good attitudes towards everyone they come in contact with, Calico System has emerged as one of the leading bands not only in St. Louis, but also throughout the Midwest region.

Blessed with a vocalist who can sing as well as draw from his various other influences, Calico System’s frontman, Mark Owens, displays a variety of diverse components with the strength of his abilities lying in his beautiful harmonies. From melodic singing & hardcore screams to System of a Downesque rants, Owens relays his lessons learned form life in a unique, intelligent, and emotionally charged way. Following Mark to complete the equation known as Calico System are Guitarists-Geoff Cardin and Shawn Keith, Bassist-Justin Haltmar, and Drummer-Erik Ramsier. 

Having influences from such groups as Hum, Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Bjork, Sunny Day Real Estate, Glassjaw, Taproot, System of a Down, Cindy Lopper, MC Hammer, and Milli Vanilli (just joking about the last three) Calico System has created a sound that is definitely worthy of being called “all their own,” and has gained them opening spots for such bands as Hatebreed, Finger Eleven, Poison the Well, Crowbar, PrimeSTH, UPO, Living Sacrifice, God Forbid, and Dog Fashion Disco.

The first and only demo was called ""Ungentle Exhumation"" and was released in the following year. In 1994 their first full-length was released, ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"", and it gained them succes and a good reputation in the underground. In 1996 they released the classic ""None So Vile"" which was a huge succes and surpassed other bands in terms of brutality. Sadly, Lord Worm left the band after the release. Michael DiSalvo (Infestation) later joined the band and he was the perfect replacement. After an impressive live show at the Milwaukee Metal Festival the band were signed to Century Media Records. 

With a new frontman and a record deal, the band recorded ""Whisper Supremacy"" which was released in 1998. They went on tours around the world and sales were up to 50,000 copies. Cryptopsy was becoming bigger and bigger and more live shows where played including the Dynamo Festival in Holland and several shows in Japan. 

After a wealth of tours the band returned to the studio and recorded ""And Then You'll Beg"" which was released in 2000. In August 2001, vocalist Michael DiSalvo was replaced by Martin Lacroix. In 2003 they released the live album, ""None So Live"", which was the last to feature Martin Lacroix as he left the band shortly after. His replacement was none other than the original vocalist, Lord Worm. In 2005, they recorded a new studio album entitled ""Once Was Not"". 

In 2008, ""The Unspoken King"" album marks the debut of Matt McGachy as well as the first and only appearance on a Cryptopsy album by Maggie Durand, as well as the band's departure from the death metal genre. The band instead perform deathcore on this album. 

After being on a record label for their entire career, Cryptopsy decided to go independent in 2012. Cryptopsy released independently the eponymous album on September 14, 2012. The album marked a return to their technical death metal sound.

In 2015, rather than a full album, Cryptopsy released the first instalment (Tome 1) of a series of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering. The band has said that The Book of Suffering Tome 1 is some of the most brutal, dark and technical music they have ever created."

Aaron Barrett (Aaron Evil) later remarked that he had feared Reel Big Fish was coming to an end, so started The Forces of Evil as a backup plan.  Two members of The Forces of Evil, John Christianson (John Evil) and Derek Gibbs (Derek Evil) went on to join Reel Big Fish.

Their early demo material was released via the small Here We Are Records label, and led indirectly to a contract with the Canadian independent Goodfellow Records. The Finding Solace In Dissension EP and the album And They Slept followed at the start of the new millennium. Both releases met with strong acclaim on the US hardcore scene, with comparisons made to the knotty alternative rock of pioneering bands such as At The Drive-In and Glassjaw.

Born was replaced by Juan Pereda at the end of 2001 and Baird by Erik Bensberg the following summer. Despite a formidable live reputation and a growing cult following, Taken chose to disband in 2004 after a series of emotional farewell concerts and the release of Between Two Unseens.

Atlanta-based post-hardcore/alternative metal act the Chariot is a showcase for singer Josh Scogin. Formerly frontman for the popular Christian nu-metallers Norma Jean (originally known as Luti-Kriss, before Dirty South rapper Ludacris eclipsed their limited popularity), Scogin left Norma Jean for undisclosed personal reasons in 2003, following the release of their second album. Largely dispensing with the rap-rock and nu-metal aspects of Norma Jean in favor of a punkier metalcore direction, Scogin almost immediately formed the Chariot with members of other area metal and CCM groups.

The original lineup of the Chariot consisted of Scogin, singer and guitarist Keller Harbin, guitarist Tony Medina, bassist Joshua Beiser, and drummer Jeff Carter. Signing to the popular Christian indie rock label Solid State Records in 2004, the band debuted later that year with the almost operatically titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding. Following the subsequent release of a live DVD, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chariot, Medina and Carter left the band; new drummer Mark Nicks debuted on the 2005 EP Unsung, but was replaced by Jake Ryan before sessions began for the band's second full-length, The Fiancee. After the album was recorded, Beiser and Harbin left the Chariot (Harbin joining Every Time I Die) and were replaced by Jon Terry and Dan Eaton in time for an extensive North American package tour with other bands from the Solid State Records roster.

Delayed by the rapid changeover in band personnel, The Fiancee eventually surfaced in early April 2007 with new bassist Jon ""KC Wolf"" Kindler on board. Terry and Eaton's time in the band would be short-lived, with the pair being replaced by Bryan Russell Taylor and Stephen Harrison before the release of the band's 2010 album, Long Live. Taylor would be the next casualty of the Chariot's revolving-door lineup, with replacement Brandon Henderson coming on board in 2011. Further lineup changes found Kindler leaving the band to attend college with Henderson and Harrison taking over bass duties in the studio. The Chariot's fifth album, One Wing, featuring production from the band's longtime engineer/producer Matt Gordon, arrived in 2012"

18839,247301,1993970,US,Metallica,No Life 'til Leather,1982,29.92,7,['Single Sided'],['Rock'],"['Thrash', 'Heavy Metal']","Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA).

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

5951,9382,1111653,France,Serge Gainsbourg,Histoire de Melody Nelson,1971,28.07,7,"['LP', 'Album']","['Rock', 'Pop']",['Psychedelic'],"(April 2, 1928 – March 2, 1991) Poet, singer-songwriter, painter, actor and director. Born in Paris, France, the son of Jewish Russian parents. He had well known children : a daughter, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Charlotte+Gainsbourg]Charlotte[/url], with [a=Jane Birkin]; and a son, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lulu+Gainsbourg]Lucien Gainsbourg[/url] (aka Lulu), with his last partner, [a=Bambou]. Two other children are non-mediatics  : Natacha (born 8 August 1964) and Paul (born 13 April 1968) with Françoise Antoinette Pancrazzi.
 
Serge Gainsbourg (born Lucien Ginsburg), wanted to be a painter but earned his living as a piano player in bars. He was tapped to join the cast of the musical 'Milord L'Arsouille', where he reluctantly assumed a singing role; self-conscious about his rather homely appearance, Gainsbourg initially wanted only to carve out a niche as a composer and producer, never as a performer.

His early influence was [a=Boris Vian]. Gainsbourg wanted to free himself from what he considered old-fashioned 'chanson' and explore other musical grounds, influenced especially by British and American pop. He also wrote soundtracks for more than 40 movies and directed himself in four movies: 'Je t'aime... moi non plus' (10 years censored*), 'Equateur', 'Charlotte For Ever' and 'Stan The Flasher'.

*  [r=541072] (1969) the song, featured simulated sounds of female orgasm. Originally recorded with [a=Brigitte Bardot], it was instead released with a future girlfriend [a=Jane Birkin] as Brigitte Bardot backed out. The song was censored in many countries and in France even the toned-down version was suppressed. The Vatican made a public statement citing the song as offensive. Its notoriety led to it reaching no. 1 in the UK chart.

A frequent interpreter of Gainsbourg's songs was British torch singer [a=Petula Clark], whose success in France was propelled by her recordings of his tunes but the first English-language version of a Gainsbourg song was [a=Dionne Warwick]'s 1965 version of 'Mamadou'.

Concept album [r=408587] produced and arranged by [a=Jean-Claude Vannier] was somewhat based on Nabokov's novel Lolita. It has proven influential with artists such as [a=Air], [a=David Holmes] who covered a track and [a=Beck].

in 1978 with [a=Robbie Shakespeare], [a=Sly Dunbar] and [a=Rita Marley] he made a Reggae version of the French national anthem ""La Marseillaise"". His version earned him death threats from right wing veterans of the Algerian War of Independence (OAS). Gainsbourg was able to reply to his critics that his version was in fact closer to the original as the manuscript clearly shows the words ""Aux armes et cætera..."" for the chorus."

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

The band was formed by vocalist [a=King Diamond (2)] and guitarist [a=Hank Shermann] in 1981.  The original MF line-up shared members with another Copenhagen band, Danger Zone, whom Diamond and Shermann were helping out.  By 1982, the ""classic"" Mercyful Fate line up of Diamond, Shermann, guitarist Michael Denner (ex-Brats and Danger Zone), bassist Timi ""Grabber"" Hansen (Danger Zone), and drummer Kim Ruzz was in place. Over the next couple years, the band would release an EP and 2 LPs that would cement their reputation as one the most influential metal bands of the early 1980s.  King Diamond's blasphemous lyrics and theatrical stage presence would have many label the band as part of the 1st wave of black metal, although musically the band was closer to the style of Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  The group split in 1985, as Shermann decided he wanted to pursue a more commercial direction.  King Diamond launched a solo career, taking Denner and Hansen with him, while Kim Ruzz disappeared into the regular world.

The band's legend continued to grow after their split.  In 1993, the classic line up, minus Kim Ruzz, reformed for a new album, ""In The Shadows"".  Hansen dropped out after that release but the group continued on throughout the 1990s.  At the same time, King Diamond kept his own solo career going.  Michael Denner left the band after 1996's ""Into The Unknown"" and Diamond and Sherman continued on with new players.  1999's ""9"" is, to date, the band's last full-length release.  King Diamond has stated that MF has not split up but the band is on hold for the foreseeable future.  In 2009, Diamond, Shermann, Denner, Hansen, and drummer Bjarne Holm (who has played with the group since 1994) reunited to re-record the songs ""Evil"" and ""Curse Of The Pharoah"" for the ""Guitar Hero:  Metallica"" video game.

In 2019, the group announced they would be playing a series of live dates.  The line up would include Diamond, Sherman, Wead, Holm, and bassist Joey Vera (filling in for Timi Hansen, who was battling cancer). Timi Hansen lost his battle with cancer on November 4th, 2019.

""Thy Dying Light"" was recorded and was to be released at Head Not Found but the parent company Voices of Wonder refused to release due to the extremity of Judas Iscariot. It was later released by Moribund Records Cult. 

Akhenaten moved from America to Germany and recorded ""Of Great Eternity"" which was released in 1997. The following two years he managed to release ""Distant in Solitary Night"" which was recorded back in 1996. He also signed a contract with the American label Red Stream. They had heard his new work ""Heaven in Flames"" and agreed to release it. In 2000 he released the MCD ""Dethroned, Conquered and Forgotten"". 

Same year, a live album ""Under the Black Sun"" was released and a split 7"" EP with Krieg, ""To the Coming Age of Intolerance"" in 2001. 

In 2002, ""To Embrace the Corpses Bleeding"" and the MCD ""Moonlight Butchery"" were released, also the EPs ""March of the Apocalypse"" and ""Midnight Frost"". Shortly after, Akhenaten announced that he decided to end the band.

The latter were transformed entirely when [a10360] from [a10343] met up with them, and formed Ash Ra Tempel. 

The trio of Göttsching / Enke / Schulze decided to abandon conventional composition and songwriting in favour of free-form improvising and developing a new musical language. As such, they became notorious for jams that could exceed 30 minutes (some such recordings can be found on [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1406291-The-Private-Tapes]The Private Tapes[/url] releases). Ash Ra Tempel went to Hamburg in March 1971 to record their debut, with the aid of top engineer [a40135]. A Krautrock twist on the space-rock music as pioneered by Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, with elements of both yet devoid of songs. One track per side: the power-drive storming ""Amboss"" and the shimmering timeless ""Traummaschine"". A yin-and-yang type concept that was followed on further albums. 

Schulze departed after the band's debut, with lots of other musicians passing through the group for their second album Schwingungen. The record had psychedelic blues numbers on one side, and a deep space trip on the other. The same concept appearing on the similarly balanced Seven Up collaboration with acid guru [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/21068-Dr-Timothy-Leary]Timothy Leary[/url].

Schulze returned for the band's 4th album Join Inn, in 1973.

Hartmut soon left the band and abandoned music altogether, leaving Göttsching to keep the band-name going, with the duo project Starring Rosi, the cosmic guitar album Inventions For Electric Guitar, and the album New Age Of Earth, after which Ash Ra Tempel were re-branded as [a49639]. A later incarnation of the band was called [a5947028]. The members were [a29855], [a549], [a761608] and [a340847]. When Göttsching died in December 2022, the Ash Ra projects died with him."

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched. Same year recorded the MCD called ""Ex Inferis"" at the Ballerina Studio. It contained a new studio track, a cover and three previously released tracks. 

In 2003 they released ""Sheol"" which gained them major success.

251657,1843456,16256604,Europe,Sodom,Genesis XIX,2020,0.0,12,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Thrash'],"German four-piece speed/thrash metal band, regarded as very influential to the modern black metal scene.

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly swords and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that ""these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that."" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan ""Death to false metal"".

Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as ""Metal Warriors"", ""Manowarriors"", ""Immortals"" or ""Brothers of Metal"".

""I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?"" - Joey DeMaio, during a 2006 interview with Rock Hard Magazine.

Fighting The World (the band's fifth release) was metal's first full-digital recording

The creation of Gods Of War was not devoid of obstacles. The band was forced to delay its release when, deep into the recording sessions, Logan suffered a devastating injuring after crashing on his prized dirtbike. Logan dislocated his elbow in the accident, an injury so severe it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career. But the guitarist fought back and after months of painful rehabilitation, he boasted he has never played his instrument better. 

During Manowar's career, the band have recorded 10 studio albums; two live albums; five DVDs and countless compilations.

Manowar's many innovations include:
* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers
* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles
* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra
* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and their own guitars as well
* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions)

Manowar created Magic Circle Music.

However, Autopilot Off's record label [l436343], took the lawsuit all the way to Federal Court and lost to the Mississippi band. Autopilot Off then signed with their major label, [l8377] shortly afterwards. After this they released their eponymous debut EP in the spring of 2002. In 2004, under their new name Autopilot Off, they released their major debut album, Make a Sound.

144998,302,696772,UK,Black Sabbath,Paranoid,1970,0.0,8,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Heavy Metal']","Considered by many to be the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath was formed in 1968 by [a=Tony Iommi], [a=Ozzy Osbourne], [a=Geezer Butler] and [a=Bill Ward] in Birmingham, UK.
The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.  In 2021, former bassist Rudy Sarzo returned to the band."

In 1998, Pig Destroyer toured the East Coast with other bands, including Drop Dead, Converge, Kid Dynamite, and Isis. Later that year they parted ways with drummer John Evans, who was then replaced by Brian Harvey. They also started to play more shows and released an album, ""Explosions in Ward 6,"" which brought them out of the underground to be known as one of the better Grindcore bands. The band continued to tour with bands like Discordance Axis, Phobia, Daybreak, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Disassociate. They also played at the 2000 March Metal Meltdown. 

In July 2000, the band signed with Relapse, and recorded a split 7"" with Isis. It sold out in a month. They later recorded and released ""38 Counts Of Battery,"" which included the remastered ""Explosions In Ward 6"" album, tracks from the Isis and Orchid splits and their demo from 1997. 

In 2001, they released ""Prowler in the yard"" which is the most extreme album they've made to date. The album got them even more fame, and the band is now of the leading Grindcore bands. 

In 2004 they released the compilation album, ""Painter of Dead Girls."""

Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

Rusted Shut was formed in 1988 by the couple of Don Walsh (vocals, guitar) & Sibyl Chance (drums), the same year the duo's previous band [a311137] disbanded. Gene Lee was soon added on bass, and the band did its first shows under the names “The Exploding Funeral Flowers” and “Bloody Mailboxes”, before settling to the name Rusted Shut. They performed very chaotic shows at local club Axiom, sometimes playing 4-hour sets.

In 1989, ex-Grindin Teeth member Bob Wilson entered the band. The group played a show opening for [a306171]. By 1990, both Lee and Wilson were out of the band, with Chance moving to bass, and the duo using a drum machine in order to write songs. In 1991, Matt Sargent (another ex-Grindin Teeth member) became the band’s drummer. The band played a few shows and contributed a track on the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/9377931-Various-Great-Big-Pile] Great Big Pile [/url] comp, before taking a break in 1993 so Walsh and Chance focus on their new project “No Rock Gods”. The trio resumed playing in 1994, and in 1996 their first release (a self-titled CD), appeared on [l47646].

After the CD’s release, Sargent left to play guitar in his Surf-Rock band. In 1997, he was replaced by [a2198499], with Kyle Phillips also joining the same year on second guitar. The band soon entered the studio (minus Phillips, who had gone to rehab) to record a few tracks that would later appear on the 2008 12”, “Hot Sex”. Later that year, the trio did another session, which would be released as their second album “Rehab” in 2003. After the album’s release, Chance separated from Walsh and left the band.

Shaun Kelly replaced Chance on bass in 2004, but left the band in 2007, and was in turn replaced by [a=Richie G.]. The new trio entered the studio in 2008 to record an improvised album for [l17358], entitled “Dead”. In 2011, Adam Ferguson was added on second guitar, but moved to bass in 2014, after Richie passed away the same year. In 2015 keyboardist Mel entered the band. In 2016, Walsh decided it was time for Rusted Shut to break-up.

In 2022, the trio of Walsh / Domokos / Adam got back together and restarted Rusted Shut."

We wanted to keep the music modern, but using older influences as well”, said guitarist Jay Aust. With Honor immediately established a solid team which consists of vocalist Todd Mackey, guitarists Jay and Jeff Aust, bass player Jack Caron and Jon Ross on drums. The band originally teamed up with Stillborn Records and released 2004’s Heart Means Everything which was extremely well received by punk and hardcore scenes alike. With Honor toured incessantly in support of the aforementioned release with bands like Hatebreed, Sick Of It All, and Comeback Kid and gained numerous fans by playing festivals like New England Metalfest, Hellfest, and Skatefest, gaining the attention of several large independent labels. Jay said, “We chose Victory because of their strong reputation and our respect for the history and bands on the label. We couldn’t have found a better place to call home.” 

This Is Our Revenge was recorded in June of 2005 at the legendary Salad Days studios with the one and only Brian McTernan. “Working with Brian was definitely a learning experience. We learned how to look at song writing in a whole new way. In the end, Brian was able to find all of our strengths and bring them out to create an accurate representation of the band”, Jay said. The title of their debut Victory album, This Is Our Revenge, pertains to the fact that music and various art forms provide an outlet from society and is a revenge on the prescribed way people are supposed to live. For the members of With Honor, the record is also a realization that rather than constant anticipation of things to come, these moments are the defining ones of their lives. "

252732,105468,489145,US,Misfits,Static Age,1997,0.0,17,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Punk'],"The Misfits are an American horror-themed punk rock band from Lodi, New Jersey. Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois.

During her time at the academy, she continued playing the piano and writing songs, nurturing her blossoming songwriting skills. Upon graduation, she moved to Hell's Kitchen, where she waitressed five nights a week and performed at local clubs on open mic nights, honing her craft and developing a stage presence. At home, she would often stay up until 4 a.m. recording demos on a four-track machine, and was signed to A&M Records in 2001. Her first video, for the song ""A Thousand Miles,"" was released even as she continued recording her debut album, and it became an instant smash on MTV, as well as cracking the American Top Ten.

We wanted to keep the music modern, but using older influences as well”, said guitarist Jay Aust. With Honor immediately established a solid team which consists of vocalist Todd Mackey, guitarists Jay and Jeff Aust, bass player Jack Caron and Jon Ross on drums. The band originally teamed up with Stillborn Records and released 2004’s Heart Means Everything which was extremely well received by punk and hardcore scenes alike. With Honor toured incessantly in support of the aforementioned release with bands like Hatebreed, Sick Of It All, and Comeback Kid and gained numerous fans by playing festivals like New England Metalfest, Hellfest, and Skatefest, gaining the attention of several large independent labels. Jay said, “We chose Victory because of their strong reputation and our respect for the history and bands on the label. We couldn’t have found a better place to call home.” 

This Is Our Revenge was recorded in June of 2005 at the legendary Salad Days studios with the one and only Brian McTernan. “Working with Brian was definitely a learning experience. We learned how to look at song writing in a whole new way. In the end, Brian was able to find all of our strengths and bring them out to create an accurate representation of the band”, Jay said. The title of their debut Victory album, This Is Our Revenge, pertains to the fact that music and various art forms provide an outlet from society and is a revenge on the prescribed way people are supposed to live. For the members of With Honor, the record is also a realization that rather than constant anticipation of things to come, these moments are the defining ones of their lives. "

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.  In 2021, former bassist Rudy Sarzo returned to the band."

Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

In 2019, further reunion plans were discussed, but the band ended upon the death of Eddie Van Halen on October 6, 2020.

Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

259856,1612325,14196538,,Borknagar,True North,2019,0.0,9,"['WAV', 'Album', 'Stereo']",['Rock'],['Black Metal'],"Progressive metal band from Bergen, Norway.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched.

It was started by Toru with High School friends Alex and Ryota after each of them got their musical instruments. After that, Taka joined as their vocalist and they focused on performing shows in the Tokyo area.

In 2006 they independently released 2 mini albums. Because of their albums sales, their participation in relatively large festivals that summer and their energetic shows in the outskirts of Tokyo, they were noticed by a foreign record company.

In March 2007 Tomoya officially joined the group and the band finally made their major debut by releasing their first single 内秘心書(Naihi Shinsho) on April 25th.

The band’s name, One Ok Rock, came from “one o’clock,” the time that the band used to practice on weekends. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between r’s and l’s, they changed “o’clock” to “o’crock” (or “o’krock”) which then was separated to become “ok rock”.

On April 5th, 2009, Alex was arrested for allegedly groping a female prep school student. They were going to release the single 「Ａｒｏｕｎｄ　ザ　ｗｏｒｌｄ　少年」on May 6th but this was cancelled. The song was also going to be used for the drama ‘God Hand Teru’ but was replaced. Also, a nationwide tour was cancelled because of the incident. On May 15th, it was announced the Alex has left the group and the other 4 members would continue activites in the summer without him.

ONE OK ROCK continued as a four-member group and made a comeback with a live concert tour that started on September 5, 2009, titled Overcome Emotion. Their first release afterwards was their fourth single, “Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer”, on February 3, 2010. The band followed up with their fourth album, Niche Syndrome, which was released on June 9. Their next single, “Answer is Near”, was released on February 16, 2011.

The band released their first double A-side single “Re:make/No Scared” on July 20, 2011, the latter song being the main theme for the Black Rock Shooter: The Game video game. The band’s fifth album, Zankyo Reference, was released on October 5, 2011. Their latest single, “The Beginning”, which is used as a theme for the live action movie adaptation of the Rurouni Kenshin manga, was released on August 22, 2012."

All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

The King Diamond band was formed in 1985 by Danish vocalist King Diamond following the break-up of his previous band, [a=Mercyful Fate].  The original line-up consisted of Diamond, his former Mercyful Fate bandmates Michael Denner (guitar) and Timi Hansen (bass), and Swedes Mikkey Dee (drums) and Andy LaRoque (guitar).  This line-up lasted for two albums before Denner and Hansen departed, the first of many line-up changes for the band.  To date, LaRoque is the only musician besides King Diamond to appear on every King Diamond band release.

With the King Diamond band, Diamond traded the occult-based and blasphemous lyrics of Mercyful Fate for a gothic horror approach.  Almost all of the lyrics on King Diamond's albums revolve around a specific story.  Only the band's debut, ""Fatal Portrait,"" and 1995's ""Spider's Lullaby"" stray from this formula, although, even in those cases, several of the songs on the albums feature lyrics that are related to each other.  In 2003, Hungarian vocalist Livia Zita was brought onboard to provide female vocals.  It marked the first time that King Diamond worked with another vocalist on any of his projects (excluding any guest appearances he made on other artists' projects).  King and Livia were later married.

The group saw their commercial success reach its peak in the mid and late 1980's, and their second album, ""Abigail"" is considered a heavy metal classic.  The group was also a target for parents' and watchdog groups who objected to King Diamond's image and what they perceived to be questionable content (although the latter was mostly based on the King's work with Mercyful Fate and his personal connections to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan).  The band has continued to work steadily, although they have been on hold in recent years because of King Diamond's health issues, which include back surgery in 2007, and a triple-bypass in 2010."

They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

Active from 1991 to 2001, its members practiced and promoted a philosophy of anarchist politics. The band included lead vocalist Dave Trenga, vocalist/guitarist Eric Good, bassist Corey Lyons, and drummer Matt Garabedian. Spitboy singer Adrienne Droogas would often join the band in their later material.

The band’s 1994 Fuck Nazi Sympathy 7"" sold 25,000 copies, making it Havoc Records’ best-selling release. Fuck Nazi Sympathy topped a list of bestselling D.I.Y. Punk record label releases compiled in 2008

Aus-Rotten went on a hiatus in the mid-‘90s and during that time Dave formed Human Investment with Andy of Anti-Flag and Corey and Eric formed Doomsday Parade. Aus-Rotten broke up for good in early 2001 and members have gone on to form Caustic Christ and Behind Enemy Lines.

On August 18, 2019 Aus-Rotten performed a few songs at Skull Fest 11 in Pittsburgh.

The band’s name comes from the German verb ""ausrotten"", which translates to “exterminate” or “eradicate”."

Singer/guitarist John Tran (stage name Johnee Trash/John E. Trash), singer/guitarist Ian ""Slur"" Cone, and drummer Bob ""Stress"" Herco met while classmates at El Modena High School in Orange, and formed Home Grown shortly after graduating. Adding singer/bassist Adam ""Adumb"" Lohrbach (who had attended Estancia High School in nearby Costa Mesa), they released their debut 7"" EP [i]Smoking Is Cool[/i] in 1994 on Insta-Noise Records. Their first full-length album, [i]That's Business[/i], was released in 1995 on local label Liberation Records. It was given an overseas release in Europe and Sweden in 1996 by Burning Heart Records, who also released their EP [i]Wusappaning?![/i] the same year (a U.S. release of the EP came in 1998 on Cargo Music/Grilled Cheese). The band's early sound was heavily influenced by ska-punk, leading to their inclusion on a number of punk- and ska-themed compilations.

Home Grown signed to major label Outpost Recordings, who released their second album, [i]Act Your Age[/i] (1998). A new recording of the [i]That's Business[/i] song ""Surfer Girl"" was released as the album's single. Cone left the band after the album's release, and was replaced by Justin Poyser. That December, Herco had surgery to remove a brain tumor. He underwent rehabilitation, was able to tour, and played on the 1999 EP [i]EP Phone Home[/i], released on Fueled By Ramen. However, he did not play on Home Grown's 2000 split EP with [a=Limbeck] on Utility Records, titled [i]Connection[/i] (Tran played drums on one track, while Poyser played on the other two). He left the band that September, citing complications from his surgery. Darren Reynolds of [a=Longfellow] was recruited to fill in for a tour that began the following month. A few dates into the tour, Poyser quit the group over personal differences, reducing them to a trio. Reynolds' membership became permanent by early 2001, but Outpost Recordings folded, leaving the band without a recording contract.

In June 2001 Home Grown signed with Drive Thru Records, who released their 2002 album [i]Kings Of Pop[/i], which found them leaning fully into a pop punk sound. Shortly after its release, guitarist Dan Hammond (of This Camero) joined the band to play on that summer's Warped Tour, eventually becoming a full time member. [i]Kings Of Pop[/i] was supported by a single and music video for ""You're Not Alone"" and additional videos for ""Kiss Me, Diss Me"" and ""I Love You, Not"". The EP [i]When It All Comes Down[/i] followed in 2004, showing the band maturing musically and lyrically. Lohrbach left Home Grown in April 2005, going on to co-found [a=New Years Day]. Home Grown continued as a live act, bringing in bassist Ted Vega, but went on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Tran started a new band called Red Panda, while Reynolds started a band called Defender and Hammond joined [a=Paper Models]."
