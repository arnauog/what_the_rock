Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California. Cochran became musician as a teenager, with a circle of friends that included Connie ""Guybo"" Smith whose nickname would later become one of his song titles. He teamed up with [a=Hank Cochran] (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools. They later called themselves [a=The Cochran Brothers], touring the south-western states and appearing on the California Hayride show. They recorded two hillbilly records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting [a=Elvis Presley] on the Dallas Big D Jamboree show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise"", their third recording on Ekko and a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of [a=Jerry Capehart].
In 1956 Cochran teamed up with Capehart and was signed to [l=Liberty] in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross, spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as [l=Crest], [l=Zephyr], Crash, [l=Vik], along with [l=Silver Records (9)], on which he recorded ""Guybo"", also known as ""Drum City"". He also appeared in two films.
Following up on his increasing American success, Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with [a=Gene Vincent] and [a=Ronnie Hawkins] to appear on popular TV and radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon [a=Shari Sheeley], later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.
On Sunday, April 17, 1960 — the day following the tour — Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car, also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat, and driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lamppost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs and collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries, aged 21. Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother [a=Bob Cochran], entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock'n'roll come of age in the UK."

The group had a local hit with ""Dear One"" the following year. In 1954, Parris formed the Five Satins with vocalists Al Denby, Ed Martin, and Jim Freeman.

In 1959, when they were still in high school, they were signed to [l=Golden Crest], their song ""Tall Cool One"" peaked the national charts at #36, and they appeared on such television shows as the [a=Alan Freed] Show and [a=Dick Clark (2)]'s American Bandstand.
At the time, [a=John Greek] was considered the leader of the Wailers, having founded the band in 1957 with a few other kids whose parents were stationed at the McCord Air Force base in Tacoma, Washington. One year later in 1960, some tension grew to an ugly head within the band, and [a=John Greek] left the Wailers. Taking his place was [a=Buck Ormsby], a bassist who originally played with [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. Together with [a=Kent Morrill], these two Wailers created [l=Etiquette Records (2)] as a means to release their own material. Their very first record was a 45 single of ""Louis Louie"" by [a=Rockin' Robin Roberts], another member of the Wailers that was initially a member of [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. This particular single, which came out in 1961, was considered the archetypal recording that inspired the [a=Kingsmen], [a=Paul Revere & the Raiders] and hundreds, if not thousands of other rock bands from the Pacific Northwest to perform the iconic song.
[a=John Greek], the man who started the band, was for the most part forgotten by the music industry. He did a few other musical ventures, including some recording with [a=Gary Paxton], some session work with the [a=The Fifth Dimension], but for the most part, he lived in obscurity, rarely to be heard from again."

He played the violin as a child and took up the guitar and the double bass as a teenager. He continued with the latter as a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra and studied orchestration at Temple University. He enlisted in the Navy in 1945 and became bandleader of the Regular Navy Dance Band in Bainbridge, Maryland. He was discharged in 1946 because his father, who had been diagnosed with cancer, could no longer support his family. Virtue considered putting together a big band but, due to financial constraints, assembled an amplified trio instead, with Ralph Frederico on the piano and Steve Rossi on the guitar. Virtue named the band the Virtuoso Trio after their formation in 1947. In 1958, he was founder member of American rock 'n' roll band [a318678] from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Their first single Guitar Boogie Shuffle (a re-arrangement of Arthur Smith's Guitar Boogie) became a hit in 1958. Later singles did not become succesful, however, and towards the end of 1962, Virtue disbanded the group and pursued a career as a record producer and recording engineer. His studio, Virtue Recording Studios ([l=Virtue Studios]), located at 1618 N. Broad St., was one of the top studios in Philadelphia for a number of years until closing in the early 1980s.

Mitchell was born Albert  George Cernik to Croatian immigrants February 22, 1927  in Detroit, Michigan. The family moved when he was 11 to Los Angeles then to San Francisco where, after leaving school, he worked as a saddle maker, supplementing his income by singing. Dude Martin, who had a country music broadcast in San Francisco, hired him for his band.

Cernik served in the United States Navy for two years in World War II, then sang with Carmen Cavallaro's big band. In 1947 he recorded for Decca with Cavallaro's band, but left due to food poisoning. He went next to New York City and made records for King Records as Al Grant (one, ""Cabaret"", appeared in the Variety charts). He won on the radio show Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1949 as a soloist.

Mitch Miller at Columbia records signed him in 1950 and urged him to change his name. Miller originally had intended to record a sentimental ballad called ""My Heart Cries for You"" and ""The Roving Kind"" with Frank Sinatra, however, Sinatra was not interested and rejected the songs. Mitchell recorded them and ""My Heart Cries for You"" became Mitchell's first hit song, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts. He continued with hits including ""Heartaches by the Number"" (#1 US), ""Rock-a-Billy"" (a crossover into the rock and roll field), ""The Same Old Me"" and the gigantic ""Singing the Blues"", which was number one for 10 weeks in 1956. He toured the world and had hits globally, especially in the UK and Australia. He placed nine songs in the US Top 10, 20 songs into the UK Top 10 (including 8 number ones) and 19 songs in the Australian Top 10 (including 3 number ones).

In the 1950s and 1960s Mitchell acted in such movies as Those Redheads From Seattle (1953) and Red Garters (1954), on television and hosted his own television show in 1957.

Mitchell's popularity waned in the 1960s, although he continued to record songs for a number of labels. In 1990, he appeared in several episodes of the BBC drama series Your Cheatin' Heart as the fictional country singer Jim Bob O'May, singing several standards including his own hit ""Singing the Blues"".

Mitchell died on July 1, 1999, aged 72, at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada of complications from cancer surgery.

His song ""Heartaches by the Number"" was part of the soundtrack of the 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas.

In 1949, brothers Rudy and Bernard West joined another set of singing brothers, Ripley and Raphael Ingram, to form gospel quartet [b]The Sentimental Four[/b]. Inspired by the harmonies of The Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots, they soon began to shift toward R&B.

The young foursome toured briefly with Miller's Brown-Skinned Models, an all-black revue that played fairs and carnivals. The act started winning local talent contests and those victories led to a chance to perform at the Apollo Theatre in New York City where the group won a contest as well. Soon after, Los Angeles-based [l=Aladdin Records] signed the group. After a few lineup changes that included adding a fifth member, the combo renamed itself The Five Keys. 

""[i]Ling, Ting, Tong[/i],"" was a number 28 pop hit in 1954. That was followed by the ballad ""[i]Out of Sight, Out of Mind[/i],"" which reached number 23 in 1956 and ""[i]Wisdom of a Fool[/i]"" which hit number 35 in 1957. However, the group's influence was greater than the best-sellers would indicate.

Before black groups started crossing over onto pop charts, The Five Keys had a powerful effect on R&B music especially among vocal harmony acts. ""One of the most popular, influential and beautiful-sounding R&B singing groups of the 1950s, The Five Keys were not only a link between the gospel/pop units of the '40s and the later R&B and rock groups, they led by example, having hits in R&B, rock 'n' roll, and pop before the decade was through,"" wrote Jay Warner in the [u]Billboard Book of American Singing Groups[/u]."

The group also included Eddie Lewis (tenor, Ward's cousin), Charles Fizer (tenor), Walter Hammond (baritone), and Melvin King (bass) and except for Lewis were friends in a Los Angeles, California, high school
Their first record was credited to Walter Ward and the Challengers (""I Can Tell"" on Melatone Records). After the name change, they recorded ""Western Movies"" (Demon Records) in the summer of 1958. Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s. The Olympics continued to perform on the oldies circuit in the United States and other countries.

Eddie Lewis, tenor singer and last original member of the Olympics, died on May 31, 2017.

The Five Satins are best known for the doo wop classic ""In The Still Of The Night"", a song that was popular enough to make the group one of the most famous doo wop outfits, although they never had another hit of the same magnitude.

The origins of the Five Satins lie in the Scarlets, a New Haven, CT, doo wop group led by Fred Parris. The Scarlets formed in 1953, while Parris was still in high school. The group had a local hit with ""Dear One"" the following year. In 1954, Parris formed the Five Satins with vocalists Al Denby, Ed Martin, and Jim Freeman. Within the next year, Parris had the group record ""In The Still Of The Night,"" a song he had recently written in the basement of a local church. The first single the group released was ""In The Still Of The Night"". The single was released on Standard Records in the spring of 1956. By the end of the year, it had been leased to Ember and became a huge hit, peaking at number three on the R&B charts and number 25 on the pop charts."

A native of Southern California, Kathy Young was born in the Orange County seat, Santa Ana, and rose to stardom in 1960 when Jim Lee, a producer at Indigo Records who, two years earlier, organized the Sun Valley-based band, The Innocents, and arranged their appearance on Wink Martindale's pop music TV show, asked them to sing backup vocals for her on the cover version of the song which had been a hit in 1954 for The Rivileers, ""A Thousand Stars"". In December, two months after her 15th birthday, Kathy Young and The Innocents peaked at #6 on the Black Singles chart, and at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Young's follow-up was ""Happy Birthday Blues"", which hit #30 on the Hot 100 in 1961. Subsequent singles, such as ""Magic Is the Night"" and ""The Great Pretender"", missed the Top 40.
In July 1961, Kathy Young joined top performers Brenda Lee, The Shirelles, Bobby Vee, Etta James, Gene McDaniels, The Ventures, Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry, The Fleetwoods, The Innocents and Jerry Lee Lewis on DJ Alan Freed's highly-publicized new American road show.
In 1962 she followed Brenda Lee to Monogram Records, recording solo and with Chicano rock singer Chris Montez. Still a teenager, she saw her promising career slowing to a standstill and, in 1964, traveled to London where she married American singer-songwriter John Maus, whose stage name was John Walker. The marriage to Maus, remembered as the founder of The Walker Brothers, a pop group most successful in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom, lasted from 1965 to 1968.
Returning to the U.S. in 1969, she remarried two years later and over the next twenty years raised children and helped manage the family citrus ranch in Central California. After a move back to Los Angeles in 1994, she began working for a major international company, while also coming home to her original passion, music and, in the 2000s, performing on numerous rock shows at venues such as the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and New Jersey's Izod Center at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.

Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s.

Born September 18, 1940, Philadelphia, PA., of Italian-Americans Mary Loretta and Nicholas J. Avallone. 
In 1959 he scored two #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, “Venus” and “Why”. Because of his youth, he was one of the first to be classified as a “Teen Idol”. He had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including “Just Ask Your Heart” (#7), “I’ll Wait For You” (#15), “Bobby Sox To Stockings” (#8), and “A Boy Without A Girl” (#10).

With other Teen Idols (including [a=Paul Anka], [a=Fabian (6)], [a=Ricky Nelson (2)] and [a=Bobby Rydell]) he performed on TV music shows such as [a=Dick Clark (2)]’s “American Bandstand”, and on stage revues. 
With [a=Annette Funicello] he starred in a number of “beach party” comedy films during the mid-1960s. Later he performed in other films in more romantic roles, as well as straight dramatic parts in the [a=John Wayne] historical western film “The Alamo”, or the 1961 science-fiction story “Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea” with [a=Barbara Eden]. Avalon also often appeared as himself in nearly two dozens of TV episodes, including ABC’s “The Bing Crosby Show” and “The Patty Duke Show”. Later he became a national television spokesperson for Sonic Drive-In. In 1965 he appeared in the Combat! episode “Brother, Brother” as a childhood friend of Pfc. Kirby, played by Jack Hogan. In the 1978 film “Grease” he performed “Beauty School Dropout” as a character called Teen Angel. 
Following an appearance on “American Bandstand” anniversary broadcast, Avalon, Fabian, and Bobby Rydell went on several long running tours of the US in the 1980s and 1990s, performing their old hits and medleys of other songs. 
Married to Kathryn Diebel since January 19, 1963, they have 8 children and 10 grandchildren. Sons Frankie Jr. (drummer) and Tony (guitarist) play on tour with Avalon."

Britain's most successful home-grown pop star, he has had more than 130 singles, albums and EP's make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist.  He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with [a27518]) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's–2000's).

He was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, ""The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook""."

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973.

One of the earliest of all Motown groups The Miracles were formed at school in Detroit in 1955 as The Five Chimes. In 1956 they changed their name to The Matadors, adding Claudette Rogers to the line-up. They were spotted by Berry Gordy at an audition in late 1957 and in February 1958 changed their name to The Miracles. Their first release, 'Got A Job' b/w 'My Mama Done Told Me', was issued via the End label that same month. Another single on End followed, and then one on Chess and Motown, before the group finally found a home on Tamla where they had a string of hits and Smokey established himself as a key songwriter for the label throughout the 1960s. 

In late 1965 Berry Gordy decided to adjust the group's name and they were billed thereafter as Smokey Robinson & The Miracles although it was still one group, until Smokey left the group in July 1972 (although the final Smokey Robinson & The Miracles single was not released until November). He was replaced by Billy Griffin, with the name being reverted back to The Miracles for the new line-up. 

The Miracles stayed with Motown until 1976, and had a number one US hit with 'Love Machine' in 1975. In 1976 they moved to Columbia.

Their first record was credited to Walter Ward and the Challengers (""I Can Tell"" on Melatone Records). After the name change, they recorded ""Western Movies"" (Demon Records) in the summer of 1958. Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s. The Olympics continued to perform on the oldies circuit in the United States and other countries.

Lanham had an over fity-year career in music. In 1939, Lanham auditioned for Archie Campbell as the country music star was coming through town and performed well enough that after receiving his parent's permission, the 16-year old left town with Campbell's troupe the next day. He moved on to WNOX Radio in Knoxville, Tennesse and became well-versed in jazz standards. Next, Lanham and the Whippoorwills played (and sometimes sang) in every episode of the Smiley Burnette radio show.
As a studio musician, Lanham played on the debut recordings of Chet Atkins (""Guitar Blues"", 1946) and Loretta Lynn (""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl"", 1960) and also played rhythmg on the Fleetwood's 1959 pop hit ""Mr. Blue"". He played with the Sons of Pioneers for 25 years (1961-1986).
Lanham had respect as a great guitarist by other players including Chet Atkins, Merle Travis, Barney Kessel and more. Rich Kienzle, journalist and historian, points out Lanham’s unique contribution that set him apart from the other country-jazz guitar giants: ""The Lanham style, harmonically richer, combined both single-note passages with luxuriant chord melodies.  The vibrant four-part harmonies he created for his chord solos were his own idea, an improvement upon three-part harmonies he heard Western swing guitarist Sheldon Bennett play."""

Partial history by Jerry Armstrong (guitar player):
""We formed the group while serving in the U.S. Navy at Boca Chica Naval Air Station, Key West Florida. We first practiced in the old base theater, beginning our trek in 1958. In 1959 we were transferred to the U.S.S. Independence, CVA-62 (Aircraft Carrier) and served aboard her until we were all discharged in 1962. We made two trips to Europe on the Indy and during the first trip entered a rock and roll contest in France and won first place. Eddie Barclay, the International Banker, saw us and liked us and signed us to a recording contract with his Barclay Records label. We later recorded for ATCO in New York City. While the band did well up and down the East Coast of the U.S. from Key West to New York City, we were most popular in Europe, with France, Greece, and Italy being countries that most favored our music. We cut several albums and EPs. In 1963, the band split and members went separate ways. Rocker Roberts took the band's name and went back to Europe where he did very well in the music business with new members. Most of us went on to other careers. I played guitar with various groups for a while. However, I retired from the Federal Government after 30 years as a personal officer and family support center director, having earned degrees in psychology and counseling. Don Borja, the bass player also made a career working with the government and designed many of the emblems and symbols used in the government today, including the seal of the department of defense. Charlie Barron became a music teacher (Piano). My attempts to contact Jerry Hendrix, Fred Lawrence, and others have been without success. While we did go back to Key West and perform on a couple of occasions, we actually left there in 1959 and never returned there except for two performances--I believe about 1960/61. We were front band for Bobby Darren on one of those trips, playing at a large music hall at Biscayne Park. The performances in Key West included members of the Grand Ole Opry (Little Jimmy Dickens, Cowboy Copas, Hank Locklin, and a few others)."""

Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an ""adult"" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics; by and large, his songs were sensitive and sensual, which is part of the reason why he achieved such a large success. Once Twitty reached the top of the country charts in the late '60s, he stayed there for years on end, releasing a consistent stream of Top Ten hits that both defined and expanded the limitations of country-pop by adding subtle R&B, pop, and rock & roll influences. Though he had some pop success, Twitty remained country to the core; occasionally, his song titles were simply too corny, which was why he retained his popularity until his death in 1993, aged 59. Son [a=Michael Twitty], daughter [a=Joni Twitty], daughter [a=Kathy Twitty], and son [a=Jimmy Twitty].

Luther married Clarencia Mae Flynn on April 5, 1959. They had four daughters and one son. Luther and Clarencia also adopted another daughter Denise and brought her into their large family. Luther‘s thirst for music came from his mother who played the piano for the African Methodist Church in Columbia, South Carolina and then in New York. Luther’s voice was one that could bring you to tears. He was singing in the chorus church and was so small, the robe dragged on the floor as he sang “Ave Maria” as a young man for 12 years. He moved to Williams Avenue in Springfield Gardens from Morning Side Avenue in Manhattan. It was there that he met Clarencia Flynn, who was 14 years old at the time and he was 12 years old. Luther had a singing group called the Dealers. Everyone at that time was into “Dowop.” You could hear it on every street corner, but Luther’s voice always stood out. Luther was always headed for Broadway, always trying to get a contract.
Luther went into the Air Force January 16, 1957. He was classified as a Metal Worker. When he was discharged he got married. He then went on to pursue his music again. In 1960 Luther put out an album. He appeared at the Rat Fink Room, the Galaxy Supper Club in Queens, New York, the Lamp Lighter and the El Carrib Country Club.
In 1963, under the singing name “Tommy Navarro,” Luther recorded “I Cried My Life Away,” with De Jac Records. This record became #18 on the “Top 100” song list nationally. He then worked with the Ruddy Williams Trio. In 1968, he joined the world famous Joe Boatner’s Ink Spots, with whom he received encore after encore whenever he sang lead. As a solo artist, he sang at the Moulin Rouge, the Show place of the Stars, August 23-24, 1968 and again November 1-2, 1968. He sang at the Flagship in Union, New Jersey as a Star with Mary Rooney and Linda Terri.
Luther sang at the Palisades Amusement Park under the Disc Jockey, Bruce Morrow of WABC. He sang at the Baby Grand in New York City on January 25, 1969 with his own trio “The Navarro Trio” and at the Velvet Room in Bellmore, New York for six weeks.

He began singing in Miami, Florida in the early 1960s while attending the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where he formed the singing group The Red Coats, who had minor success with the song ""I Want You To Love Me"" but in 1963 his cover of Arthur Alexander's ""Everyday I Have To Cry"" became a national hit. From 1961 to 1966 he released 7 albums, but is perhaps best known for hosting and co-producing Dick Clark's 'Where the Action Is' from 1965-1967 on ABC-TV. 
In the late 1960s, Alaimo stopped performing to open his own record company with partner [a=Henry Stone], which became part of Stone's Miami-based T.K. Records combine.

He is is an American movie actor, singer, novelist, and activist. Primarily known for his character-type roles in the 1960s and 1970s, as an adult Petersen established the organization A Minor Consideration to support child stars and other child laborers through legislation, family education, and personal intervention and counseling for those in crisis.
Petersen achieved fame in the 1960s, at an early age, by playing Donna Reed's son, Jeff Stone, on The Donna Reed Show. In the early 1980s, he also had a recurring role as a police officer on Matt Houston, and in the late 1990s, he played the author Paul Conway in the film Mommy's Day.
Petersen's fame brought recording offers and although his singing voice was limited, he had hit record singles with songs ""She Can't Find Her Keys"", ""Amy"", and ""Lollipops and Roses"", as well as ""My Dad"" that made #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also recorded during the 1960s for Motown, including the singles ""Chained"" (later a hit for Marvin Gaye) and ""A Little Bit For Sandy.""

In 1949, brothers Rudy and Bernard West joined another set of singing brothers, Ripley and Raphael Ingram, to form gospel quartet [b]The Sentimental Four[/b]. Inspired by the harmonies of The Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots, they soon began to shift toward R&B.

The young foursome toured briefly with Miller's Brown-Skinned Models, an all-black revue that played fairs and carnivals. The act started winning local talent contests and those victories led to a chance to perform at the Apollo Theatre in New York City where the group won a contest as well. Soon after, Los Angeles-based [l=Aladdin Records] signed the group. After a few lineup changes that included adding a fifth member, the combo renamed itself The Five Keys. 

""[i]Ling, Ting, Tong[/i],"" was a number 28 pop hit in 1954. That was followed by the ballad ""[i]Out of Sight, Out of Mind[/i],"" which reached number 23 in 1956 and ""[i]Wisdom of a Fool[/i]"" which hit number 35 in 1957. However, the group's influence was greater than the best-sellers would indicate.

Before black groups started crossing over onto pop charts, The Five Keys had a powerful effect on R&B music especially among vocal harmony acts. ""One of the most popular, influential and beautiful-sounding R&B singing groups of the 1950s, The Five Keys were not only a link between the gospel/pop units of the '40s and the later R&B and rock groups, they led by example, having hits in R&B, rock 'n' roll, and pop before the decade was through,"" wrote Jay Warner in the [u]Billboard Book of American Singing Groups[/u]."

Louis played a crucial role in the development of rhythm and blues and is considered one of the forerunners of rock and roll. Jordan and his band were known for their upbeat, humorous songs and engaging stage presence. Jordan's music mixed swing, blues, and boogie-woogie into something frequently called jump blues. His music often included witty lyrics and a strong emphasis on rhythm, laying the groundwork for rock and roll. He popularized the use of smaller ensembles during the big band era, showcasing a sound that was accessible, danceable, and adaptable for jukeboxes. Jordan played all forms of saxophone, the clarinet and piano. His specialty was the alto sax.

He recorded numerous hits, including ""Caldonia,"" ""Choo Choo Ch'Boogie,"" ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" and ""Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens."" Many of these songs became crossover successes on both the R&B and pop charts.

Louis Jordan significantly influenced a wide range of musicians and genres. His lively performance style, humorous storytelling, and innovative approach to blending genres inspired artists like [a=Chuck Berry], [a=Little Richard], [a=Bill Haley], [a=Ray Charles], [a=James Brown], [a=Dizzy Gillespie], [a=B.B.

James Wilson (lead), Gene Warr (first tenor), Aubie McSwain (second tenor), and Al Warr (bass) had known each other since childhood and sung together for years, throughout the '40s. Their main influence was gospel music, and they'd sung in churches for most of their lives. They quartet had sung locally around Center, TX, mostly at local events and church functions. 

They took on the name The Four Mints and crossed over into popular music and R&B in 1954-1955. They'd always listened to the black R&B vocal groups of the period and proved good -- even inspired -- students: unlike, say, the Crew Cuts, The Four Mints didn't ""bleach"" out the sounds that they learned to create, but kept them intact even as they made them their own. They were, in many respects, the group equivalent of the phenomenon that Sam Phillips claims to have been searching for, a white man who could sing black music. 

What's more, they were good enough to get bookings far outside of Center, even managing to cross paths with Elvis Presley in the process and even getting his future drummer, D.J. Fontana, on the skins for some of their gigs in Louisiana. They cut a handful of songs for Lin Records in Gainesville, TX, including ""Night Air"" and ""Little Mama Tree Top"" (the latter unissued for 40 years). Although sometimes identified, for convenience's sake, as a doo wop group, the Mints were more animated than most of the acts to which the name is usually applied -- their models were groups like the Treniers, most of all, more so than the balladeer-type outfits usually called doo wop groups. 

The Four Mints left Lin after just a few months for the much larger Decca label in 1956. They failed to generate any hits, but Decca's promotional efforts on their behalf and the resulting exposure gave them the intro the needed to break out of the south and become a national act. They followed their idols, the Treniers, into the same Las Vegas clubs and remained popular for years. McSwain left the quartet in 1960. He was replaced, and the group lasted for another two years, breaking up in 1962.

Dale helped pioneer the sounds of surf music and has been proclaimed ""King of the Surf Guitar"". The 1961 single Let's Go Trippin' on his own [l=Deltone Records] is considered the first surf record. Wanting his playing to reflect the sounds and feeling of surfing, Dale used staccato picking on heavy gauge strings and heavily reverbed amplification (although this was not present on his initial recordings), which he worked closely with Leo Fender to help develop custom-made amplifiers. Dick was also a self-taught player, learning to play left-handed on a right-handed guitar without restringing the instrument (even in his late years, he still played with the guitar strung upside down). His playing often displayed a Middle-Eastern influence which came from his father's family (who is Lebanese).

Dale started out playing around southern California with his backing band, the Del-Tones, in the late 1950s. [a=Dick Dale & His Del-Tones] became a popular attraction around southern California and Dick had appearances in a number of 1960's ""beach"" movies.  Early records were released by Dick's father, [a=Jim Monsour] on the [l=Deltone Records] imprint. Dick later signed to Capital Records and issued for 4 studio LPs (there were frequent line up changes in the Deltones and the Capital LPs featured Dick backed by mostly studio musicians).  A bout with rectal cancer forced Dick's retirement in 1965 but he returned in the 1970s', reviving the Del-Tone name for a time. He eventually dropped the Del-Tone name a released several solo albums in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 1994, his biggest hit 'Miserlou' gained popularity again by being chosen as opening tune for the Quentin Tarantino film 'Pulp Fiction'.  Although his studio output in the new millennium was sparse, Dick continued to perform live. In early 2008, Dick announced that his rectal cancer had returned and he was in the process of receiving treatment.

He returned to touring work in 2009 and has toured up until being treated again, this time for heart failure and kidney failure which finally led to his death at the age of 81."

The Surf Teen were a band consisting of brothers, Jeff and John Hammond, Greg Smith and Tony Johnson. At the time of their discovery, Jeff Hammond was 16 years old and played lead guitar.John Hammond was 13 years old and played drums. Greg Smith was 16 and played rhythm guitar. And Tony Johnson was 20 and played bass.  

How the Surf Teens came to be associated with [a1030124], former sax man of [a252800] was a result of contact with the mother of two members Jeff and John Hammond. She had been calling him to come and check out the band that her kids had. He had been looking for acts to release on his [l499374] label. Making the trip to Atascadero which is 20 miles north of San Obispo, he saw them. They were playing their music in the garage which was instrumental rock and roll. He noticed they were very young and also very good. He had them booked to play at Pismo Beach on July 12, 1963, opening for [a251666]. For their efforts they were paid $25.00. The next night they played at the Atascadero Lake Pavilion and for that they got $50.00. The following week they got $100 which was about what other bands got.

He had them learn covers by other bands such as The Centurians (see [a424490]), [a251673], The [a252800] etc. and told them if their songs were good his Westco label would record them. They recorded a single, ""Moment of Truth"" bw ""Moonshine"" . Released on Westco WC-9, it was pressed in very limited numbers, mainly for promotion. For an album, he had the group recorded more material at [a682491]'s studio in Watts. Brinson, an African American man had been running a studio out of his garage and this is where [a1074304] had most of his surf bands recorded. They included [a254863] and [a520679]. Knowles went looking for an album deal, and through Tony Hilder he had the release done on the budget [l83234] label. The release [i][m=307177][/i]  (Sutton SSU 339), had just a mention of the band's name on the cover and label. There was no other info except for a list of the tracks on the front cover. Over time this has added to the mystery of the band and the intrigue it invokes.

Some of their tracks appeared on the [i][m=1290092][/i] which was released on the budget [l175247] compilation in 1965. This probably represents the only other appearance of the band on any other release until the early 1990s. Their album has been re-released in 1998 and 2014 on the [l63349] label. The later re-releases include unreleased tracks by the band that were on a reel of tape that Knowles discovered in his vault.

January 1935 in Huntsville, Arkansas (USA), died 29 May 2022, Ronnie Hawkins was a pioneering rock and roll musician, highly influential in the introduction & growth of rock music in Canada. On advice from [a=Conway Twitty], Hawkins toured Canada in 1958 where he found instant success in Hamilton, Ontario, and later settled down in Mississauga before moving to Stoney Lake, just outside of Peterborough, Ontario, in 1970. It was here he established his ""Hawkstone"" complex, nicknamed ""Canada's Graceland.""

Usually touring and sometimes recording as [a=Ronnie Hawkins] And [a=The Hawks (2)], Hawkins is legendary for his skill as a talent scout & mentor. His band had an ever-changing lineup with many members going on to successful careers elsewhere. Notable in his career was the December 1969 stay by [a=John Lennon] & [a=Yoko Ono] at his home in Mississauga, Ontario. Lennon signed his erotic ""Bag One"" lithographs during his stay there during the couple's campaign to promote world peace. His achievements include induction into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2002, in recognition of his lifetime contribution to music and his generous support of the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario and other charitable organizations. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2004, and in 2013, Hawkins was made an Honourary Officer of the Order of Canada. 

Hawkins has been mostly retired since his 80th birthday concert, dubbed ""The Last Hurrah"", at Toronto's [l=Massey Hall] in 2015, and sold Hawkstone in 2017.

For unknown reasons, the Hawkins songs ""Going to the River"" and ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman"" have been credited to Alice Cooper and released on various versions of the live album [m204910]"

Their first record was credited to Walter Ward and the Challengers (""I Can Tell"" on Melatone Records). After the name change, they recorded ""Western Movies"" (Demon Records) in the summer of 1958. Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s. The Olympics continued to perform on the oldies circuit in the United States and other countries.

The group formed in 1962 while its members were teens, and won local attention under the umbrella of manager/record producer, Tom Ayers. Only Doug Phillps (lead singer) & Corkie Wilkie (keyboards) were original members in the original group. They released a single in 1962 entitled ""Hot Pastrami"", which was a takeoff of Nat Kendrick & the Swans's ""Mashed Potatoes"". Dot Records picked the song up for national distribution, and it peaked at #11 on the US Pop and #15 on the R&B chart in 1963. The group appeared on <i> The Munsters </i> while the single was successful, and an album titled after the single was released; and this record hit #95 on the Billboard 200. Subsequent singles fared less well; ""Dance Everybody Dance"" peaked at #99 Pop, and the third single, a cover of The Beau Marks's ""Clap Your Hands"", failed to chart. The group split up shortly thereafter.

Lead singer Doug Phillips later played in New Concepts and Cottonwood, neither of which enjoyed sustained success. Some of the group's members later joined the short-lived late 1960s group Rain.

He first came to prominence in the early 1960s as the right-hand-man of producer Phil Spector and went on to work with the Rolling Stones and Neil Young, among others. He also worked extensively in film scores, notably for films such as Performance, The Exorcist and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. In 1983, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing ""Up Where We Belong"" with his then-wife [a384185]

The Nitzsche-phone

Nitzsche was a keyboard player on many mid-1960s albums by The Rolling Stones. On several, he was also credited as the player of the ""Nitzsche-phone"". In an obituary on Gadfly Online, former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham explained the credit:

   "" I made that up for the credits on those Stones albums—it was just a regular piano (or maybe an organ) mic'd differently. It was all part of this package that was created around the Stones. People believed it existed. The idea was meant to be: ""My god, they’ve had to invent new instruments to capture this new sound they hear in their brains."" And they were inventing fresh sounds with old toys—therefore, it deserved to be highlighted—it was the read-up of creation, of imagination—getting credit for a job well done."""

One of the earliest of all Motown groups The Miracles were formed at school in Detroit in 1955 as The Five Chimes. In 1956 they changed their name to The Matadors, adding Claudette Rogers to the line-up. They were spotted by Berry Gordy at an audition in late 1957 and in February 1958 changed their name to The Miracles. Their first release, 'Got A Job' b/w 'My Mama Done Told Me', was issued via the End label that same month. Another single on End followed, and then one on Chess and Motown, before the group finally found a home on Tamla where they had a string of hits and Smokey established himself as a key songwriter for the label throughout the 1960s. 

In late 1965 Berry Gordy decided to adjust the group's name and they were billed thereafter as Smokey Robinson & The Miracles although it was still one group, until Smokey left the group in July 1972 (although the final Smokey Robinson & The Miracles single was not released until November). He was replaced by Billy Griffin, with the name being reverted back to The Miracles for the new line-up. 

The Miracles stayed with Motown until 1976, and had a number one US hit with 'Love Machine' in 1975. In 1976 they moved to Columbia.

From www.soulwalking.co.uk:

Phillip John Flowers was a Washington area singer and composer who performed in the United States and abroad since the 1950's.  He was sometimes described as ""The Black Elvis"" and ""Skip Manning.""

He recorded singles on the Hollywood label, during the late Fifties, under the name of Phil Flowers And The Batmen.

These included the tunes 'Honey Chile', 'What It Means To Be Blue' and 'Lover Man'.

Phil recorded several albums in the sixties notably 'Our Man In Washington', 'Rhythm And Blues', 'I Am The Greatest' and 'Phil Flowers Sings A Tribute To Nat King Cole'.

Some of his single releases included 'Discontented', Where Did I Go Wrong?' ( both popular on the Northern Soul scene), 'Cleopatra, You Little Devil', 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'Man The Wife And The Little Baby', 'Nothing Lasts Forever', 'Like A Rolling Stone', 'Bingo, What Did I Do', 'Walking At Night' and 'Son Of Mine'.

He was a member of the group Jebadiah and worked with Link Wray and Barry Darvell.

Phil, and his group 'The Flower Shop', toured the U.S. in the late sixties and were involved in calming the race riots that followed Reverend Martin Luther King's assassination.

Those of you who listen to, London and Manchester based, deejays such as Robbie Vincent, Richard Searling and Bob Jones, will be aware of a 12"" single on Future Records (from the late Eighties) entitled 'Stay A While'.

The track was produced by Phil, Al Johnson and Chuck Brown.

The song was a fine independent release that was manufactured in very small quantities boasting some fine production input from the great Al Johnson.

Phil, additionally, performed live with his family.

Phil Flowers died of cancer on 22nd January 2001 at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital, after collapsing at his home in Rockville.   He was 66 years old.

From raresoul.com:
""More than 2,000 people attended King Curtis’ funeral at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Midtown Manhattan.

A number of important figures attended the services, including [a=Aretha Franklin], her father [a=Reverend C.L. Franklin], [a=Stevie Wonder], [a=Brook Benton], [a=The Isley Brothers] and [a=Rev. Jesse Jackson], who delivered the eulogy.

King Curtis is still by far, the most influential saxophone player in the history of R&B and Rock & Roll music.

King Curtis played on thousands of records as the most in demand saxophone player, from the early 1950s until his death in August of 1971.

He worked with a wide variety of artists ranging from [a=The Coasters] and [a=Buddy Holly], to [a=Jimi Hendrix] and [a=John Lennon].

King Curtis began playing the saxophone at a young age in Fort Worth, Texas. He turned down a scholarship to pursue an opportunity as a member of [a=Lionel Hampton]’s touring band.

In 1952, King Curtis moved to New York to become one of the most in-demand session players, where his famous style of playing can be heard on classic songs like “Yakety Yak” by [a=The Coasters], “Twistin’ the Night Away” by [a=Sam Cooke], “Tossin’ and Turnin’ By [a=Bobby Lewis] and numerous others.

In 1961, King Curtis released his own hit record with [a=King Curtis And The Noble Knights] titled “Soul Twist,” which landed at #1 for two weeks in April of 1962.

In 1965, he supported The Beatles at Shea Stadium (including a number backing Brenda Holloway), signed with Atlantic Records’ Atco imprint and in 1967, King Curtis hit big with the singles “Memphis Soul Stew” and “Ode To Billie Joe,” while also leading [a=Aretha Franklin]’s backing band, [a=King Curtis & The Kingpins].

Just months before King Curtis was stabbed, he was featured as a guest on [a=John Lennon]’s landmark album Imagine.""

The Sandals began in 1962, when Danny Brawner, a drummer, joined a high-school group called The Twangs, headed up by the brothers Gaston and Walter Georis. The Twangs were a group heavily influenced by The Ventures. At this point, the core of The Sandals was formed: Brawner on drums, Gaston on keyboards, Walter on rhythm guitar, John Blakeley on lead guitar with his brother, David, on bass. David was replaced by John Gibson early on. The band changed their name to The Shadows, and eventually settled on The Sandells, a portmanteu of ""Sand"" and ""ells"", a popular ending for groups at the time. They released their first album, Scrambler!, in early 1964. They partnered with World Pacific Records for the release, which allowed them to come in contact with Bruce Brown, who was then just beginning editing work on his next documentary project, The Endless Summer.

Brawner and the Georis brothers met with Brown, hoping to sell him one of their songs for use on Brown's new film. Brown, however, was so impressed by their music that he agreed to use a number of their songs in the film. It was agreed that all film profit would go to Brown, and all soundtrack profit to go to The Sandells. The group used the studio time that working on the film gave them to release a number of LPs and Singles during this period. Jim King[disambiguation needed] worked with the group at this time, producing a number of songs, including ""Always"" and ""All Over Again"", both of which received limited national radio airplay. The group also slightly modified their name during this time, to the surf-inspired ""The Sandals"". For a time, the group toured with the film, providing live backing for the live narration by Bruce Brown.

After The Endless Summer film reached nationwide distribution, The Sandals recorded the song ""Endless Summer"", one of their first songs with vocals. The song was a departure in a number of ways, and not just relating to the vocals. They were attempting a Beach Boys-esque sound, with mixed results. The also re-released the Scrambler! LP as The Endless Summer, along with new single records similarly retitled.

In 1967, Dick Barrymore hired The Sandals to score his skiing documentary, The Last of the Ski Bums. As on Scrambler!, Danny Brawner's songwriting skills were at the forefront of the album — 10 of the 12 songs contained at least some of his input. However, this album also marked Danny's departure from the band after he refused to leave San Clemente, California, where the band had been based, for Riverside, California. He was replaced by Steve Ekwall, who played on the album.

Soon after the release of the Last of the Ski Bums album, the group broke up. The Georis brothers went on to start a restaurant in Carmel, California; Danny Brawner worked for Mobile Surfboards. John Blakeley remained involved in music, joining Stoneground in 1971.

There have been two reunions to date: in 1994, the Georis brothers and Blakeley reformed the band, and released a few albums, most notably working on The Endless Summer II. In 2002, the Georis', Blakeley, Gibson, and Brawner played at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana, California, to a packed house.

They should not be confused with the British mid-1960s band of the same name [a1574828]. In Britain, the name ""U.S. T-Bones"" was used for the Liberty Records group.
When the T-Bones had a hit in 1966 with the single No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In), Liberty Records quickly recorded an album of the same name using session musicians from The Wrecking Crew, but those musicians weren't willing to go on tour to promote the album. They were making too much money doing sessions in Los Angeles. So Liberty created a different ""public"" T-Bones group to appear on record covers, TV, and in concert. The ""public"" T-Bones were Judd Hamilton, Dan Hamilton, Joe Frank Carollo, Tommy Reynolds, and Gene Pello. None of them played on the hit record, nor did they play on the next album, ""Sippin' and Chippin."" However the ""public"" T-Bones did record the T-Bones' final album, ""Everyone's Gone To The Moon (And Other Trips)."" Dan Hamilton, Carollo, and Reynolds would later form the 1970s soft rock trio Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds. 
""No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)"", was based on the melody from a commercial for Alka-Seltzer. The tune reached #3, and its follow-up, ""Sippin N Chippin"", peaked at #62; the accompanying album hit #75 on the Billboard 200."

Dale helped pioneer the sounds of surf music and has been proclaimed ""King of the Surf Guitar"". The 1961 single Let's Go Trippin' on his own [l=Deltone Records] is considered the first surf record. Wanting his playing to reflect the sounds and feeling of surfing, Dale used staccato picking on heavy gauge strings and heavily reverbed amplification (although this was not present on his initial recordings), which he worked closely with Leo Fender to help develop custom-made amplifiers. Dick was also a self-taught player, learning to play left-handed on a right-handed guitar without restringing the instrument (even in his late years, he still played with the guitar strung upside down). His playing often displayed a Middle-Eastern influence which came from his father's family (who is Lebanese).

Dale started out playing around southern California with his backing band, the Del-Tones, in the late 1950s. [a=Dick Dale & His Del-Tones] became a popular attraction around southern California and Dick had appearances in a number of 1960's ""beach"" movies.

Dick later signed to Capital Records and issued for 4 studio LPs (there were frequent line up changes in the Deltones and the Capital LPs featured Dick backed by mostly studio musicians).  A bout with rectal cancer forced Dick's retirement in 1965 but he returned in the 1970s', reviving the Del-Tone name for a time. He eventually dropped the Del-Tone name a released several solo albums in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 1994, his biggest hit 'Miserlou' gained popularity again by being chosen as opening tune for the Quentin Tarantino film 'Pulp Fiction'.  Although his studio output in the new millennium was sparse, Dick continued to perform live. In early 2008, Dick announced that his rectal cancer had returned and he was in the process of receiving treatment.

He returned to touring work in 2009 and has toured up until being treated again, this time for heart failure and kidney failure which finally led to his death at the age of 81."

When the T-Bones had a hit in 1966 with the single No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In), Liberty Records quickly recorded an album of the same name using session musicians from The Wrecking Crew, but those musicians weren't willing to go on tour to promote the album. They were making too much money doing sessions in Los Angeles. So Liberty created a different ""public"" T-Bones group to appear on record covers, TV, and in concert. The ""public"" T-Bones were Judd Hamilton, Dan Hamilton, Joe Frank Carollo, Tommy Reynolds, and Gene Pello. None of them played on the hit record, nor did they play on the next album, ""Sippin' and Chippin."" However the ""public"" T-Bones did record the T-Bones' final album, ""Everyone's Gone To The Moon (And Other Trips)."" Dan Hamilton, Carollo, and Reynolds would later form the 1970s soft rock trio Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds. 
""No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)"", was based on the melody from a commercial for Alka-Seltzer. The tune reached #3, and its follow-up, ""Sippin N Chippin"", peaked at #62; the accompanying album hit #75 on the Billboard 200."

Considered one of the first (if not the first) surf bands, the group was fronted by guitarist/vocalist [a=Dick Dale].  Formed in the late '50s, the group was extremely popular on their home turf.  Dale's father, [a=Jim Monsour], released several singles and an LP, ""Surfer's Choice"", (most of which were recorded live) on [l=Deltone Records].  The band's repertoire varied between Dick Dale-penned instrumentals and R&B and pop-flavored vocals tracks (usually cover songs) sung by Dale.  The group was signed by Capitol Records in 1963.  Apparently, there were frequent line up changes in the Del-Tones.  On the albums released by Capitol, Dick Dale was mostly accompanied by studio musicians.  

With 1963's ""Checkered Flag"" and 1964's ""Mr. Eliminator"", Dick Dale & His Del-Tones switched their focus from surfing to cars, as was the trend at the time, but Dale returned to surfing for ""Summer Surf"" (also released in 1964), his last record for Capital. In 1965, after being diagnosed with rectal cancer and frustrated with the music industry, Dick Dale retired from music.  However, Dale would return to music in the 1970s, reviving the Del-Tone name and performing around southern California.  Dale eventually dropped the Del-Tone name altogether and released several albums as a solo artist.  Although Dick Dale owned the rights to his old music, including the records on Capital, the old albums remained out of print for a number of years, with only selected tracks appearing on several different ""Greatest Hits"" compilations.  Eventually, [l=Sundazed Music] reissued the band's early records in 2006 & 2007.

The band’s recording of ""Louie Louie"" was a nationwide hit in 1964, and it has remained one of the most popular rock songs of all time.
The band got its start in Portland in 1959 when two teenaged friends, drummer Lynn Easton and guitarist Jack Ely, started playing popular music together. By 1960, Mike Mitchell, on lead guitar, and Bob Nordby, on bass, had joined the band. Ken Chase, a local Top 40 radio personality and the owner of the Chase, a teen dance club in Milwaukie, OR, took the group under his wing, and the Kingsmen became the club’s house band in 1961. Don Gallucci joined the group on keyboards in 1962.
""Louie Louie,"" an R&B calypso tune about a homesick sailor, was written and recorded by Los Angeles singer Richard Berry in 1956 and became a short-lived regional hit in California.  Composer Berry sold the rights to his famous song for $750 in 1959. The song was rediscovered a few years later by bands in the Seattle area. Rockin' Robin Roberts and the Wailers recorded it, and it became a regional hit in the Northwest in 1961. It was that version that became one of the most popular tunes in the Kingsmen's repertoire.
On April 6, 1963, Ken Chase met the band at a Portland recording studio to cut ""Louie Louie"" as its first single record. He called the recording good after the second take. The song featured vocalist Jack Ely shouting into a boom microphone suspended above his head. A thousand copies were released on the Jerden label out of Seattle. While the tune got some airplay in the Northwest, it did not become a hit until October, when an influential Boston disc jockey, Arnie ""Woo Woo"" Ginsberg, featured it as his ""Worst Record of the Week"". Many listeners loved the record, and when it was released again on the Wand label, the record began to climb the Billboard charts, primarily because of sales in the Northeast.
Meanwhile, in August 1963, the Kingsmen disbanded. Ely and Nordby quit the group over differences with Easton, who had to reconstitute the band when ""Louie Louie"" began gaining popularity. After several changes of personnel, the new band included Dick Peterson on drums, Norm Sundholm on bass, and Barry Curtis on keyboards. Easton replaced Ely as lead vocalist. The William Morris Agency took over management, and the Kingsmen recorded their first album and began extensive touring.
By December 14, ""Louie Louie"" had reached number two on the Billboard charts, where it stayed for six weeks, but the obscurity [and unintelligible lyrics] of Ely's vocal performance was causing controversy. In January, a constituent complained to Indiana Governor Matthew Welsh that an obscene record was getting radio airplay in the state. Welsh and his staff agreed that the lyrics were ""pornographic,"" and he asked the Indiana Broadcasters Association to ban the record. The FBI launched an investigation to determine if ""Louie Louie"" violated the federal law prohibiting interstate transportation of obscene materials. After two and a half years, the FBI concluded that it could not determine if the lyrics were obscene because they were unintelligible. In the meantime, versions of the imaginary lyrics were circulating in high schools and college campuses all over the United States, helping to push the popularity of the Kingsmen to new heights.
The Kingsmen continued to tour and make national television appearances. They had another top-ten hit with ""The Jolly Green Giant"" in 1965, but their popularity had faded by the end of 1967 as musical tastes changed. The group once again disbanded. Since the 1970s, original member Mike Mitchell along with Dick Peterson and Barry Curtis have continued to perform as the Kingsmen with other musicians. Jack Ely died in 2015.
""Louie Louie"" experienced a revival when it was featured in the movie Animal House in 1978. The song has been recorded by hundreds of performers and is widely acknowledged as one of the most important records in rock and roll history. ""Louie Louie"" was recorded in one take [some say two takes] for a one hour session that cost $36.

At the time, [a=John Greek] was considered the leader of the Wailers, having founded the band in 1957 with a few other kids whose parents were stationed at the McCord Air Force base in Tacoma, Washington. One year later in 1960, some tension grew to an ugly head within the band, and [a=John Greek] left the Wailers. Taking his place was [a=Buck Ormsby], a bassist who originally played with [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. Together with [a=Kent Morrill], these two Wailers created [l=Etiquette Records (2)] as a means to release their own material. Their very first record was a 45 single of ""Louis Louie"" by [a=Rockin' Robin Roberts], another member of the Wailers that was initially a member of [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. This particular single, which came out in 1961, was considered the archetypal recording that inspired the [a=Kingsmen], [a=Paul Revere & the Raiders] and hundreds, if not thousands of other rock bands from the Pacific Northwest to perform the iconic song.
[a=John Greek], the man who started the band, was for the most part forgotten by the music industry. He did a few other musical ventures, including some recording with [a=Gary Paxton], some session work with the [a=The Fifth Dimension], but for the most part, he lived in obscurity, rarely to be heard from again."

Having been inducted into the South Carolina Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame and most recently the South Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame, The Embers are honored to carry the moniker of North Carolina’s Official Ambassadors of Music.

The Embers were awarded Military Coins of Excellence for their distinguished service.

The Embers are widely considered a musical marvel and have laid the groundwork for what has become known as ‘Beach Music’ in the Carolinas, Virginias, the gulf coast region of North America and every beach in between. A true musical tradition with which many Americans have grown. The Embers consider the genre of Beach Music as “music with a memory” and have been creating lasting memories since its inception in 1958. Simply put – Heart and Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Feel Good Music.

Today, touring is commonplace for The Embers regularly boasting an average of 225 shows per year. The Embers also embark on a cruise each year for their friends and fans to various locations throughout the Caribbean.

He was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles.

Considered one of the first (if not the first) surf bands, the group was fronted by guitarist/vocalist [a=Dick Dale].  Formed in the late '50s, the group was extremely popular on their home turf.  Dale's father, [a=Jim Monsour], released several singles and an LP, ""Surfer's Choice"", (most of which were recorded live) on [l=Deltone Records].  The band's repertoire varied between Dick Dale-penned instrumentals and R&B and pop-flavored vocals tracks (usually cover songs) sung by Dale.  The group was signed by Capitol Records in 1963.  Apparently, there were frequent line up changes in the Del-Tones.  On the albums released by Capitol, Dick Dale was mostly accompanied by studio musicians.  

With 1963's ""Checkered Flag"" and 1964's ""Mr. Eliminator"", Dick Dale & His Del-Tones switched their focus from surfing to cars, as was the trend at the time, but Dale returned to surfing for ""Summer Surf"" (also released in 1964), his last record for Capital. In 1965, after being diagnosed with rectal cancer and frustrated with the music industry, Dick Dale retired from music.  However, Dale would return to music in the 1970s, reviving the Del-Tone name and performing around southern California.  Dale eventually dropped the Del-Tone name altogether and released several albums as a solo artist.  Although Dick Dale owned the rights to his old music, including the records on Capital, the old albums remained out of print for a number of years, with only selected tracks appearing on several different ""Greatest Hits"" compilations.  Eventually, [l=Sundazed Music] reissued the band's early records in 2006 & 2007.

Born to William Nathan Stafford and Juanita J. Stafford in Hollis, Oklahoma, Terry Stafford grew up in Amarillo, Texas, and graduated from Amarillo's Palo Duro High School in 1960. After high school he moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a career in music.

His most famous song, ""Suspicion"", which was released on Crusader Records and which had previously been recorded by Elvis Presley, made it to #3 in the US and #31 in the UK singles charts. ""Suspicion,"" with a vocal by Stafford that reminded many listeners of Presley, had the unusual distinction of being at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 4, 1964, just below The Beatles when they made history by holding down the entire top five. The following week is when ""Suspicion"" topped out at #3, with The Beatles holding the other four spots of the top 5. Stafford's recording sold over one million copies. His follow-up, ""I'll Touch a Star"", made #25 in America. Both recordings were produced by Bob Summers (brother-in-law of Les Paul), who played all the instruments on the tracks as well as engineering and recording them. Bob released his own version in the 1970s as well as a remake with Ed Greenwald on vocals in 2008.

From www.soulwalking.co.uk:

Phillip John Flowers was a Washington area singer and composer who performed in the United States and abroad since the 1950's.  He was sometimes described as ""The Black Elvis"" and ""Skip Manning.""

He recorded singles on the Hollywood label, during the late Fifties, under the name of Phil Flowers And The Batmen.

These included the tunes 'Honey Chile', 'What It Means To Be Blue' and 'Lover Man'.

Phil recorded several albums in the sixties notably 'Our Man In Washington', 'Rhythm And Blues', 'I Am The Greatest' and 'Phil Flowers Sings A Tribute To Nat King Cole'.

Some of his single releases included 'Discontented', Where Did I Go Wrong?' ( both popular on the Northern Soul scene), 'Cleopatra, You Little Devil', 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'Man The Wife And The Little Baby', 'Nothing Lasts Forever', 'Like A Rolling Stone', 'Bingo, What Did I Do', 'Walking At Night' and 'Son Of Mine'.

He was a member of the group Jebadiah and worked with Link Wray and Barry Darvell.

Phil, and his group 'The Flower Shop', toured the U.S. in the late sixties and were involved in calming the race riots that followed Reverend Martin Luther King's assassination.

Those of you who listen to, London and Manchester based, deejays such as Robbie Vincent, Richard Searling and Bob Jones, will be aware of a 12"" single on Future Records (from the late Eighties) entitled 'Stay A While'.

The track was produced by Phil, Al Johnson and Chuck Brown.

The song was a fine independent release that was manufactured in very small quantities boasting some fine production input from the great Al Johnson.

Phil, additionally, performed live with his family.

Phil Flowers died of cancer on 22nd January 2001 at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital, after collapsing at his home in Rockville.   He was 66 years old.

In Beach Party (1963) she is credited as the ""perpetual motion dancer."" She remained a part of the series for the next three films, with her last appearance being in 1964 in Pajama Party, where she had a small cameo role.[3]

She also recorded under the name ""Candy Johnson and her Exciters."" The Exciters were a band her agent (and future husband) Red Gilson managed and partnered her with. The recordings of Candy and the Exciters were released by Canjo records, a private label started by Johnson and Gilson in 1964 to capitalize on her club and film appearances. Canjo was in business for only one year and released two albums and seven singles.

She also appeared at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, New York.

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it."

Hugely successful female vocal group formed in 1961, after initially after being called [a=The Primettes] from 1959 to 1960. Their best-known and most stable lineup was Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson, in which configuration they became Motown's top act of the 1960s, though of that line-up only Wilson remained in the group by the time of the 1970s disco incarnation represented here.

The Supremes varied their name in early 1967 to Diana Ross & The Supremes. Motown president [a=Berry Gordy] stated that the name change was done so that Motown could demand more money from live bookings, but rumors began to spread of an approaching Diana Ross solo career. The name variation was applied retrospectively with the first release under that being a [m=294679] of early songs.

At that time, member Florence Ballard had begun drinking and occasionally missing performances and, by June 1967, was replaced by Cindy Birdsong, a member of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Patti+LaBelle+And+The+Bluebells]Patti LaBelle & The Blue Belles[/url].

In January 1970, Diana Ross & The Supremes gave their final performance under that name and Ross began her solo career. Jean Terrell replaced Diana as the lead singer and the name of the group was reverted back to just The Supremes.

Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an ""adult"" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics; by and large, his songs were sensitive and sensual, which is part of the reason why he achieved such a large success. Once Twitty reached the top of the country charts in the late '60s, he stayed there for years on end, releasing a consistent stream of Top Ten hits that both defined and expanded the limitations of country-pop by adding subtle R&B, pop, and rock & roll influences. Though he had some pop success, Twitty remained country to the core; occasionally, his song titles were simply too corny, which was why he retained his popularity until his death in 1993, aged 59.

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it."

A popular teen Rock 'n' Roll idol singer in the 1960's. He began his musical career during his childhood. By the time he entered his teens he was already a seasoned performer, had changed his surname to Rydell and was playing drums in the band ""Rocco And The Saints"".
1959 was the year ""Kissin' Time"" made it on to the top twenty and for the next four years Bobby Rydell was a regular on the music charts. Among his long list of hits were ""Forget Him"", ""Wild One"" and ""Sway"". As well as his musical career he also made appearances on television shows starring in dramatic roles.
By the mid-60's Rydell's popularity was on the wane as the British groups began to make it onto the American music charts, but the singer continued to perform in cabaret shows for his many loyal fans."

He was born on 10 November 1928 in Rome, Italy and died on 6 July 2020 in Rome, Italy. A favourite pupil of [a776673], he also deputized secretly for his trumpeter father in a light music orchestra. He thus developed two distinct sides to his musical personality: one of these led him to embrace serialism and the experimental work of the improvisation group [a146775]; the other gained him a leading role, principally as an arranger, in all types of mass-media popular music, including songs for radio, radio and television plays, and the first successful television variety shows.
After many minor cinematic collaborations, Morricone achieved wider recognition with [a=Sergio Leone]'s series of four Westerns. There followed important collaborations with directors such as [a1549141], [a467451], [a3153386], [a4424119], [a4424126], Roland Joffé and [a4424108]. Despite inevitable self-repetitions over a total of more than 400 film scores, his work provides many examples of a highly original fusion of classical and popular idioms.
Morricone's non-film works form a large and increasingly widely performed part of his output. Many of them use his technique of ‘micro-cells’, a pseudo-serial approach often incorporating modal and tonal allusions, which, with its extreme reduction of compositional materials, has much in common with his film-music techniques.
Among honours, he won the Academy Award in 2016 for his score to [a=Quentin Tarantino]'s The Hateful Eight and has received five Academy Award nominations between 1979 and 2001, a Grammy and a Leone d'oro, and was awarded the Laurea ad Honorem by the University of Cagliari. Between 1991 and 1996 he taught film music at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana, Siena."

Their name derived from an Orcadian song The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry, which they sometimes performed. They were briefly considered to be the English equivalent of Peter, Paul and Mary, with their common repertoire of Bob Dylan songs, and the original Australian folk group, The Seekers. The original quartet were Hull University  students and consisted of Sylvia Tatler (vocals), Mike Ramsden (guitar and vocals), Ivor Aylesbury (guitar and vocals) and Kevin Cunningham (double bass). The group received help from John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison to record their cover version of ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" on 9 August 1965 at the IBC Studios at about the same time as The Beatles' own version was being released on their album Help! The song charted in the UK at # 28 and also reached # 10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in the same year. John Lennon produced while Paul McCartney played the guitar and George Harrison kept time by tapping his guitar and also playing the tambourine. When the recording was completed, Lennon was so pleased with it that he rang Brian Epstein, played it over the phone to him, and told him that they had just recorded a Number 1 hit. The Silkie had been scheduled to tour the United States in December 1965 and had even been booked to appear on both the Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand, but were unable to obtain the necessary visas and work permits so the tour was subsequently cancelled. Two further singles released in 1966 failed to make the UK or U.S. charts and The Silkie finally split up."

That of [a=Paul Buff], whose engineering skills had led him to build PAL Studio in Cucamonga, initially at 8020 Archibald Avenue and then at 8040 - where it eventually became [a=Frank Zappa]'s 'Studio Z' in 1964. Buff offered flat-rate fee tariffs to up-and-coming bands who needed cost-effective recordings. He engineered a number of surf bands (despite being in the desert location) and his work launched The Surfaris and The Chantays, but he benefited no more than they by some devious re-recording of the works.

As Zappa (who had lived nearby with his first wife) began to occupy the studio, a number of other musicians began to regularly appear. Dave Aerni, Ronnie Williams and various personnel from Zappa's early groups. Buff created a number of 'labels' and pressed limited quantities of projects on them. A few San Bernardino stores would carry them and Buff then got local DJs to air-play them. When the radio station did their weekly sales-check with the stores they would discover stock had almost gone. That's because the studio team had anonymously purchased them all - and the station would chart the disc, at least into the top forty. Buff & co would then go to Hollywood and 'persuade' A&R music men to advance them large sums for national release of the 'hit'. Hence ""The Hollywood Persuaders"".

Some of the Buff 'scams' did actually chart. ""Tijuana Surf"" was #1 in the charts (above The Beatles) in 1964 (with Zappa's ""Grunion Run"" on the flipside). Buff's ""Drums-A-Go-Go"" was covered by Sandy Nelson and his original made its way into the soundtrack of ""Natural-Born Killers""

Considered one of the first (if not the first) surf bands, the group was fronted by guitarist/vocalist [a=Dick Dale].  Formed in the late '50s, the group was extremely popular on their home turf.  Dale's father, [a=Jim Monsour], released several singles and an LP, ""Surfer's Choice"", (most of which were recorded live) on [l=Deltone Records].  The band's repertoire varied between Dick Dale-penned instrumentals and R&B and pop-flavored vocals tracks (usually cover songs) sung by Dale.  The group was signed by Capitol Records in 1963.  Apparently, there were frequent line up changes in the Del-Tones.  On the albums released by Capitol, Dick Dale was mostly accompanied by studio musicians.  

With 1963's ""Checkered Flag"" and 1964's ""Mr. Eliminator"", Dick Dale & His Del-Tones switched their focus from surfing to cars, as was the trend at the time, but Dale returned to surfing for ""Summer Surf"" (also released in 1964), his last record for Capital. In 1965, after being diagnosed with rectal cancer and frustrated with the music industry, Dick Dale retired from music.  However, Dale would return to music in the 1970s, reviving the Del-Tone name and performing around southern California.  Dale eventually dropped the Del-Tone name altogether and released several albums as a solo artist.  Although Dick Dale owned the rights to his old music, including the records on Capital, the old albums remained out of print for a number of years, with only selected tracks appearing on several different ""Greatest Hits"" compilations.  Eventually, [l=Sundazed Music] reissued the band's early records in 2006 & 2007.

The band solidified its iconic lineup in 1962, featuring [a46481] (vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica, keyboards, percussion), [a35301] (vocals, bass, guitar, keyboards, percussion), [a243955] (lead guitar, vocals, keyboards), and [a259352] (drums, vocals, percussion) after signing a recording contract with EMI. This followed a brief period with Stuart Sutcliffe (bass, 1960-61) and Pete Best (drums, 1960-62).

Initially recognized for their Merseybeat style, the Beatles soon ventured into uncharted musical territories, exploring psychedelia and pioneering innovative production techniques that incorporated tape loops and other effects. Over their active years, they created a legacy of 12 studio albums.

Their profound impact on rock and roll was acknowledged in 1988 when they were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame as a group. By 2015, each member had also received individual recognition for their contributions as solo artists within the Hall of Fame."

Noted for their exploration of blues, rhythm and blues, and rock music, the group consisted of Keith Relf on vocals and harmonica, Paul Samwell-Smith on bass, Chris Dreja on rhythm guitar and later bass when Samwell-Smith left the band, and Jim McCarty on drums. A defining characteristic of the band was its revolving lineup of lead guitarists, starting with [a1459091] in 1963, followed by [a17827] (1963-1965), [a49624] (1965-1966), and lastly, [a180585] (1966-1968).

Their approach to music was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of rock 'n' roll, notably influencing the development of hard rock and psychedelic rock genres. Known for their high-energy performances, they popularized the ""rave-up"" style, where a song builds in tempo and intensity, a technique that later found its way into heavy metal.

In 1992, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as performers, with the band continuing to tour under the leadership of Jim McCarty with a constantly evolving lineup."

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US.

Don Gallucci joined the group on keyboards in 1962.
""Louie Louie,"" an R&B calypso tune about a homesick sailor, was written and recorded by Los Angeles singer Richard Berry in 1956 and became a short-lived regional hit in California.  Composer Berry sold the rights to his famous song for $750 in 1959. The song was rediscovered a few years later by bands in the Seattle area. Rockin' Robin Roberts and the Wailers recorded it, and it became a regional hit in the Northwest in 1961. It was that version that became one of the most popular tunes in the Kingsmen's repertoire.
On April 6, 1963, Ken Chase met the band at a Portland recording studio to cut ""Louie Louie"" as its first single record. He called the recording good after the second take. The song featured vocalist Jack Ely shouting into a boom microphone suspended above his head. A thousand copies were released on the Jerden label out of Seattle. While the tune got some airplay in the Northwest, it did not become a hit until October, when an influential Boston disc jockey, Arnie ""Woo Woo"" Ginsberg, featured it as his ""Worst Record of the Week"". Many listeners loved the record, and when it was released again on the Wand label, the record began to climb the Billboard charts, primarily because of sales in the Northeast.
Meanwhile, in August 1963, the Kingsmen disbanded. Ely and Nordby quit the group over differences with Easton, who had to reconstitute the band when ""Louie Louie"" began gaining popularity. After several changes of personnel, the new band included Dick Peterson on drums, Norm Sundholm on bass, and Barry Curtis on keyboards. Easton replaced Ely as lead vocalist. The William Morris Agency took over management, and the Kingsmen recorded their first album and began extensive touring.
By December 14, ""Louie Louie"" had reached number two on the Billboard charts, where it stayed for six weeks, but the obscurity [and unintelligible lyrics] of Ely's vocal performance was causing controversy. In January, a constituent complained to Indiana Governor Matthew Welsh that an obscene record was getting radio airplay in the state. Welsh and his staff agreed that the lyrics were ""pornographic,"" and he asked the Indiana Broadcasters Association to ban the record. The FBI launched an investigation to determine if ""Louie Louie"" violated the federal law prohibiting interstate transportation of obscene materials. After two and a half years, the FBI concluded that it could not determine if the lyrics were obscene because they were unintelligible. In the meantime, versions of the imaginary lyrics were circulating in high schools and college campuses all over the United States, helping to push the popularity of the Kingsmen to new heights.
The Kingsmen continued to tour and make national television appearances. They had another top-ten hit with ""The Jolly Green Giant"" in 1965, but their popularity had faded by the end of 1967 as musical tastes changed. The group once again disbanded. Since the 1970s, original member Mike Mitchell along with Dick Peterson and Barry Curtis have continued to perform as the Kingsmen with other musicians. Jack Ely died in 2015.
""Louie Louie"" experienced a revival when it was featured in the movie Animal House in 1978. The song has been recorded by hundreds of performers and is widely acknowledged as one of the most important records in rock and roll history. ""Louie Louie"" was recorded in one take [some say two takes] for a one hour session that cost $36.

The Fugitives started out under the name The Tremelos when pianist Glenn Quackenbush met drummer Elmer Clawson . The original line-up was completed with bassist John Boyles , lead guitarist Rett Nichols and Glenn's younger brother Gary Quackenbush. 

Initially they played only instrumentals songs but some time later  they began doing vocal songs ,at which point bassist John Boyles also took on lead vocals, being that he was the best one in the band to handle the singing.

Whilst playing at a ""New Year's Eve Party"" the band were introduced to Edward 'Punch' Andrews and his friend Dave Leone. Both men, saw themselves as being big-time record moguls, and liking what they had seen, convinced the band that they should be recording and Dave Leone had just the song.

A fan of the TV show The Fugitive, Leone had written a song with the same title, and then convinced The Tremelos to record it and also change their name to The Fugitives. 

Dave Leone then decided to contact the makers of the TV Show to get the permission to use the title. But the shows producer Quinn Martin shut him down as far as rights and usage of the show's name.Dave decided to put the record out as 'A Fugitive'.    

February 1964 and The Fugitives recorded 'A Fugitive'. Dave Leone managed to get it released on 'D-Town Records', a local small R&B label.

They were making too much money doing sessions in Los Angeles. So Liberty created a different ""public"" T-Bones group to appear on record covers, TV, and in concert. The ""public"" T-Bones were Judd Hamilton, Dan Hamilton, Joe Frank Carollo, Tommy Reynolds, and Gene Pello. None of them played on the hit record, nor did they play on the next album, ""Sippin' and Chippin."" However the ""public"" T-Bones did record the T-Bones' final album, ""Everyone's Gone To The Moon (And Other Trips).""

""No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)"", was based on the melody from a commercial for Alka-Seltzer. The tune reached #3, and its follow-up, ""Sippin N Chippin"", peaked at #62; the accompanying album hit #75 on the Billboard 200."

George Martin took to music at an early age, becoming interested in the piano before the age of eight. He was later interested in architecture, design, and aeronautics, and ended up becoming a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (the aviation branch of the Royal Navy) towards the end of World War II. 

He returned to music, attending [l305416], studying composition, conducting, orchestration, and theory, and taking up the oboe as a second principal instrument. He got into the music industry as assistant to [a=Oscar Preuss], the head of the [l=Parlophone] label, at a period when the label was in transition from second-rate classical recordings to ""pop"" music. At the same time, the world of music recording was transitioning from 78s to LPs and 45s, with magnetic tape making changes in the recording process. When Preuss  retired in 1955, Martin took over Parlophone, and at 29 was the youngest label chief in the company's history. 

As a producer, George Martin's first number one hit in the U.K. was [a=The Temperance Seven]'s ""You're Driving Me Crazy"" in 1961. Martin moved Parlophone into the world of rock & roll with [a=The Vipers Skiffle Group], whose second single, ""Don't You Rock Me, Daddy-O"", was a Top Ten hit. Then, in the spring of 1962, Martin happened to interview [a=Brian Epstein], a Liverpool-based manager, about a quartet known as [a=The Beatles]. That summer, they were signed to Parlophone. Over the following years, Martin would help to shape The Beatles, getting credit from some as being the ""fifth Beatle"" for his work with the band. In 1963, records produced by Martin spent 37 weeks at the number one spot on the U.K. charts. But two years later, Martin split from Parlophone, due to the small producer's royalty which had not increased during the explosive growth of the label, to form in 1965 AIR (Associated Independent Recording). This production company was headed by Martin and two other producers who came from [l=EMI], Parlophone's parent label.

The Beatles were produced by George Martin through 1969's [i]Abbey Road[/i], and it wasn't until The Beatles broke up that Martin was completely free from his ties to EMI. In the 1970s, he produced a wide variety of artists and bands, from [a=America (2)] and [a=Jimmy Webb] to [a=Jeff Beck] and the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra]. He continued to work with an array of artists via his company Associated Independent Recording (AIR). in 1969 when George Martin left EMI to establish [l264566] (fourth floor in 214 Oxford Street) an independent recording complex in the heart of central London, active since 1969 to 1991 then studio moved to [l890708] where George worked from 1992 to 2006. In 1979 opened [l268095] but closed after a tropical hurricane in 1989.

On June 15th, 1996, George Martin was knighted for his production work over the decades, especially with The Beatles. On October 20, 1998, [i]In My Life[/i] was released, and Sir George Martin took a bow from the music business. His last album was a collection of Beatles songs he originally produced, recreated by a variety of well-known artists.  He briefly came out of retirement in 2005, and with the aid of his son (with his second wife), [a=Giles Martin], he compiled clips and songs for the Beatles' and [a=Cirque Du Soleil]'s [i]LOVE[/i] project and remix album.

Formed late 50's, active till late 60's
Considered one of the hottest rock bands to emerge from the Pacific Northwest. In 1959, when they were still in high school, they were signed to [l=Golden Crest], their song ""Tall Cool One"" peaked the national charts at #36, and they appeared on such television shows as the [a=Alan Freed] Show and [a=Dick Clark (2)]'s American Bandstand.
At the time, [a=John Greek] was considered the leader of the Wailers, having founded the band in 1957 with a few other kids whose parents were stationed at the McCord Air Force base in Tacoma, Washington. One year later in 1960, some tension grew to an ugly head within the band, and [a=John Greek] left the Wailers. Taking his place was [a=Buck Ormsby], a bassist who originally played with [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. Together with [a=Kent Morrill], these two Wailers created [l=Etiquette Records (2)] as a means to release their own material.

This particular single, which came out in 1961, was considered the archetypal recording that inspired the [a=Kingsmen], [a=Paul Revere & the Raiders] and hundreds, if not thousands of other rock bands from the Pacific Northwest to perform the iconic song.
[a=John Greek], the man who started the band, was for the most part forgotten by the music industry.

The latter being written and produced by legendary producer [a=Phil Spector] from 1964, which many critics deem to be the pinnacle of Spectors' producing career. In order for Lovin' Feelin's success, many believe it can be attributed to the fact the playing time was listed on the original promo's sent to radio stations as 3:05 --because Spector refused to shorten the track-- which was lower that it's actual playing time of nearer 4 minutes at 3:45. This is because at that time many stations would program shows to fit-in with ad-breaks so wouldn't play anything longer than around 3 minutes long. Also, British pop artist [a=Cilla Black] released a version in Christmas 1964, before the original version was released in the UK, which furthermore attracted media attention. All this happening despite the US being in the middle of Beatlemania and the British Invasion. 

In 1999, the performing-rights organization Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) announced that it was the most-played song of the 20th century. Additionally, the song was chosen as one of the Songs Of The Century by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Between 1964 and 1966, they charted with teen melodramas, and remain especially known for their million-selling #5, which was their first 7"" for Red Bird, Remember (Walkin' in the Sand), followed by their US #1 hit Leader of The Pack and Give Him A Great Big Kiss.

The group was formed at Andrew Jackson High School in Cambria Heights, a neighborhood in Queens, New York City, in 1963. They were two sets of sisters: Mary Weiss (1948-2024, the youngest, and their main lead singer, who was only 15 when she sang on their two biggest hits in 1964) and Elizabeth ""Betty"" Weiss (b. 1946), and identical twins Marguerite ""Marge""/""Margie"" Ganser (1948-96) and Mary Ann Ganser (1948-1970).

They began their career by playing school shows, talent shows and teen hops, which brought them to the attention of Artie Ripp, who arranged the group's first record deal with Kama Sutra. Their first recording in December 1963 was Simon Says, later issued on the Smash label. They also recorded Wishing Well b/w Hate to Say I Told You So, which in early 1964 was their first release, when leased to the small Spokane label.

In April 1964 they signed to Red Bird, and that was the start of their most successful period, beginning with Remember (Walkin' in the Sand) b/w I's Easier To Cry, produced by Artie Ripp. After this, most of their material was produced by George ""Shadow"" Morton. In 1966-1967 there were unsuccessful releases on Mercury, and they broke up in 1968.

There were subsequent reunions, the last in 1989, after which Entertainment Tonight revealed that another group was imitating them and using their (apparently unregistered) name, and being managed by an unconnected individual named Larry Marshak. Legal action ensued, and a court ordered this group to stop performing under the Shangri-Las name.

In 1960, they changed their name to the Bachelors.

Their growing popularity brought them to the attention of London agent/entrepreneur Phil Solomon (a fellow Irishman), who appointed himself their manager and they landed shows in Britain as well as some recording sessions at Decca records. Newly arrived producer from Chicago, Shel Talmy, produced ""Charmaine"" (a song originally composed for the 1926 silent movie ""What Price Glory?"") in a Country & Western pop folk style and the record was a hit peaking at #6 in Britain in 1963 and #8 in Ireland in the same year.

By 1968 their chart presence had dissipated. Their last chart single in the UK was in 1967 (""Marta"" #20 UK) but their last chart placement anywhere was in Australia in 1968 with ""The Unicorn"" (#40). They however were still popular live and continued to play the cabaret circuit. In 1971 they starred in a UK TV situation comedy series, ""Under and Over"", playing three Irish railway labourers working on the London Underground.

The original line up was maintained until 1984, when there was a split between the Cluskey brothers and Stokes. Following the split, the Cluskey brothers appeared as ""The New Bachelors"" and then ""Con & Dec, The Bachelors"". Stokes also appeared as as ""The New Bachelors"" and ""Stokes & Coe"".

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US.

Promoted and tutored by an enthusiastic father, she had started singing professionally at the age of seven and made her radio debut aged nine. She became a familiar singing voice on wartime radio and in concerts for the troops. By the end of the 1940s she was an established singing star and she also appeared as an actress in many films of the era working with such stars as Peter Ustinov, Anthony Newley and Alec Guinness.

Petula’s first recordings were Rank promo 78’s in 1949 and her first commercial recording was “House In The Sky” / Put Your Shoes On Lucy for Columbia in 1949. Her first major recording contract was with Polygon Records in 1950 and her first chart success was in 1954 with “The Little Shoemaker”, which also got issued on 45 and 78 in the USA. A series of chart successes continued in the U.K. from the 1950s to the early 1970s including two number ones: “Sailor” and “This Is My Song”. In 1988 a remix of “Downtown” brought her back to the UK Top 10.

Her breakthrough on the Continent was in 1957 with “With All My Heart“ hitting the upper reaches of the Dutch and Belgian charts, and she had her first French language hit the same year with “Histoire d'un amour”. Petula married Frenchman [a1183035] on 8 June 1961, by which time she was already one of France’s top female singers. Throughout the 1960s she had big hits in France with songs such as “Romeo”, “Ya ya twist” “Coeur blessé“ “Chariot” “Que fait tu là Petula"" and “C’est ma chanson”.

In 1962, the German language only song “Monsieur” reached number one on the German charts and achieved gold record status there. She also topped the charts in Italy and Spain with songs sung in the respective languages.

In 1965 Petula finally found success in America with her number one, double Grammy award winning song “Downtown”. She won another Grammy for the follow up “I Know A Place” and in 1966 she became the first British female singer to top the American charts twice with “My Love”. She was voted Top Female Singer by Cashbox music trade magazine in 1966, and again in 1968 by Playboy magazine. Petula hit the American Top 40 15 times in three years.

Petula has continued to record and tour throughout the world. In 2012 her song “Cut Copy Me” hit the Belgian pop charts and a dance remix hit the club charts all over Europe. Petula was back on the British album charts in 2013 with “Lost In You” and in 2016 with “From Now On“. Her French-Canadian album “Vu d’ici” peaked at #39 on the iTunes daily national chart in Canada in 2018, and in 2019, a greatest hits album reached the physical album and sales chart in the U.K. seventy years after her first record release."

They're probably best known for two tracks ""Unchained Melody"" and ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' "". The latter being written and produced by legendary producer [a=Phil Spector] from 1964, which many critics deem to be the pinnacle of Spectors' producing career. In order for Lovin' Feelin's success, many believe it can be attributed to the fact the playing time was listed on the original promo's sent to radio stations as 3:05 --because Spector refused to shorten the track-- which was lower that it's actual playing time of nearer 4 minutes at 3:45. This is because at that time many stations would program shows to fit-in with ad-breaks so wouldn't play anything longer than around 3 minutes long. Also, British pop artist [a=Cilla Black] released a version in Christmas 1964, before the original version was released in the UK, which furthermore attracted media attention. All this happening despite the US being in the middle of Beatlemania and the British Invasion. 

In 1999, the performing-rights organization Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) announced that it was the most-played song of the 20th century. Additionally, the song was chosen as one of the Songs Of The Century by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

He first began playing in a group called The Five Pearls while still a teen in the 1950s. His first appearance on record was a single titled ""All About Ann"", released on Cincinnati, Ohio label Fraternity Records.

He moved to Los Angeles with an ensemble in the early 1960s, but his band failed and he returned to West Virginia. Later in the 1960s he moved to New York City. He played the uptown East Side local Bar's (Malachy's II) (72nd & Lexington) and eventually found success in New York. He released his debut album on Warner Bros. Records in 1970. He scored two minor hit singles in the US in the early 1970s. Further releases followed later in the decade, as did a third hit in 1980.

Richards made the first recording of Tom Snow and Nan O'Byrne's ""You Might Need Somebody"", which was subsequently a UK hit twice, reaching number 11 hit for Randy Crawford in 1981 and number 4 for Shola Ama in 1997.

The Embers boast numerous albums and single releases that span decades and all the crazes continuing to exhibit top quality showmanship, musicianship and professionalism. Having been inducted into the South Carolina Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame and most recently the South Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame, The Embers are honored to carry the moniker of North Carolina’s Official Ambassadors of Music. This group has traveled the country and the world and have performed for every event imaginable from the highest dignitaries to the hottest back yard frat parties. The Embers were also honored to travel throughout South Korea to perform their Christmas special ‘Christmas with the Embers’ on American Military bases for America’s troops in December of 2007 and 2008. The Embers were awarded Military Coins of Excellence for their distinguished service.

The Embers are widely considered a musical marvel and have laid the groundwork for what has become known as ‘Beach Music’ in the Carolinas, Virginias, the gulf coast region of North America and every beach in between. A true musical tradition with which many Americans have grown. The Embers consider the genre of Beach Music as “music with a memory” and have been creating lasting memories since its inception in 1958. Simply put – Heart and Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Feel Good Music.

Today, touring is commonplace for The Embers regularly boasting an average of 225 shows per year.

In 1961, King Curtis released his own hit record with [a=King Curtis And The Noble Knights] titled “Soul Twist,” which landed at #1 for two weeks in April of 1962.

In the process, they helped move the music itself forward, providing a key link between doo wop and '60s soul. 
Formed in Brooklyn, NY, in 1958, the group originally consisted of Eugene Pitt, Jerome Hanna, Richard Harris, Billy Prophet, and Norman Johnson. the Jive Five's first hit, ""My True Story,"" was their biggest, peaking at number one on the R&B charts and number three on the pop charts in the summer of 1961. None of the band's subsequent singles -- including 1962's minor R&B hit ""These Golden Rings"" -- were as popular, but the group managed to keep performing and recording. Under the direction of Eugene Pitt and Norman Johnson, the Jive Five refashioned themselves as a soul band in 1964, forming a new lineup with Casey Spencer (tenor), Webster Harris (tenor), and Beatrice Best (baritone). This new incarnation of the band signed to United Artists Records. The group only had one hit on UA, 1965's ""I'm a Happy Man."" 
In 1966, the Jive Five left United Artists and signed with Musicor, where they had the 1968 R&B hit ""Sugar (Don't Take Away My Candy)."" They changed labels again in 1970, signing with Decca. That same year, they changed their name to the Jive Fyve, in order to appear more contemporary. the Jyve Fyve had only one minor R&B hit, 1970's ""I Want You to Be My Baby."" 
The group continued to perform and record for a variety of small labels during the '70s, but never had another hit. Throughout the '70s and '80s, the only constant member was Eugene Pitt. In 1975, Pitt changed the name of the group to Ebony, Ivory & Jade, but this new incarnation failed to gain much attention. In 1982 Pitt changed the name of the group back to the Jive Five and the band recorded two albums for the indie label Ambient Sound.

From 1998-2006The Jive Five consisted of: Eugene Pitt, Artie Loria, Bea Best, Danny Loria, Maurice Unthank and Harold Gil. They recorded ""It's Christmas"" for Dazzle Records. They continued to perform to audiences worldwide. They also recorded tracks for an album ""Still Jiving"" that was shelved bur will be repackaged in 2020 in tribute and in memorium to Eugene Pitt who passed in 1999.

This followed a brief period with Stuart Sutcliffe (bass, 1960-61) and Pete Best (drums, 1960-62).

Initially recognized for their Merseybeat style, the Beatles soon ventured into uncharted musical territories, exploring psychedelia and pioneering innovative production techniques that incorporated tape loops and other effects. Over their active years, they created a legacy of 12 studio albums.

Their profound impact on rock and roll was acknowledged in 1988 when they were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame as a group. By 2015, each member had also received individual recognition for their contributions as solo artists within the Hall of Fame."

They should not be confused with the British mid-1960s band of the same name [a1574828]. In Britain, the name ""U.S. T-Bones"" was used for the Liberty Records group.
When the T-Bones had a hit in 1966 with the single No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In), Liberty Records quickly recorded an album of the same name using session musicians from The Wrecking Crew, but those musicians weren't willing to go on tour to promote the album. They were making too much money doing sessions in Los Angeles. So Liberty created a different ""public"" T-Bones group to appear on record covers, TV, and in concert. The ""public"" T-Bones were Judd Hamilton, Dan Hamilton, Joe Frank Carollo, Tommy Reynolds, and Gene Pello. None of them played on the hit record, nor did they play on the next album, ""Sippin' and Chippin."" However the ""public"" T-Bones did record the T-Bones' final album, ""Everyone's Gone To The Moon (And Other Trips)."" Dan Hamilton, Carollo, and Reynolds would later form the 1970s soft rock trio Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds. 
""No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)"", was based on the melody from a commercial for Alka-Seltzer. The tune reached #3, and its follow-up, ""Sippin N Chippin"", peaked at #62; the accompanying album hit #75 on the Billboard 200."

The Mindbenders decided to carry on as a trio after Fontana's departure — Eric Stewart was the primary lead singer and guitarist, Robert Lang played bass, and Ric Rothwell was the drummer. Both Lang and Rothwell sang backing vocals, and took the occasional lead vocal on album tracks. Their first single without Fontana was the hit ""A Groovy Kind of Love"" (written by [a=Carole Bayer Sager]/[a=Toni Wine]). The song reached No. 2 in the US (No. 1 on the Cashbox singles chart) and No. 2 in the UK in 1966. It sold one million copies globally. The 1966 album of the same name managed to reach No. 28 in the UK. The Mindbenders toured America, even playing at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, but, just as a year earlier, the group was unable to sustain its popularity. Their second album, ""With Woman in Mind,"" did not sell well and was not even released in the United States. The Mindbenders appeared in the 1967 [a=Sidney Poitier] movie, ""To Sir, with Love"" and were also featured on the soundtrack. Shortly thereafter, Rothwell quit the band and was replaced by Paul Hancox. In March 1968, Lang also quit and was replaced by Graham Gouldman.

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US. The band continues to tour today, with Whitwam as the only remaining member from the original lineup."

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US. The band continues to tour today, with Whitwam as the only remaining member from the original lineup."

The Remains formed in 1964 at Boston University, where all four members were first-year students living in the same dorm in Kenmore Square. Singer-guitarist Barry Tashian and keyboardist Bill Briggs were from Westport, Connecticut, drummer Chip Damiani from Wolcott, Connecticut, and bassist Vern Miller from Livingston, New Jersey. They began playing r&b and rock'n'roll covers, as well as some Tashian originals, at The Rathskeller, a tavern across the square from their dorm. Soon, fans were lining up from Kenmore Square to Fenway Park to see them, and management had to clear out a disused basement to accommodate the crowds

The band became a popular live act throughout New England, and, after signing with Epic Records, enjoyed local hits with a catchy, swinging Tashian original, ""Why Do I Cry"", and their hard-driving version of the Bo Diddley/Willie Dixon classic ""Diddy Wah Diddy"". In 1965 the Remains relocated to New York City - where they appeared on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' - and then, after about a year, moved on to California. They recorded an album, The Remains, appeared on NBC TV's 'Hullabaloo', and released the soulful, hard-rocking single ""Don't Look Back"".[3]

In 1966 came the opportunity which might have broken the band nationally, but proved instead to be their last hurrah: they were offered a three-week stint as an opening act for the Beatles, on what would turn out to be the fab four's final tour. Immediately before the tour, drummer Chip Damiani quit the band, to be replaced by future Mountain drummer N.D. Smart. Said Tashian in a 2012 interview: ""We had always been the four of us and we’d played hundreds and hundreds of gigs as the four of us and all of a sudden this big tour comes up and boom! We have to play it with a new drummer who didn’t have the same feel that Chip had. I mean he was a fine drummer but it wasn’t the same band. I just felt like the flame was burning down without our original drummer.""[2]

The band broke up in late 1966, and Epic released their self-titled debut album to little fanfare"

They never sold many records in England, or any in America, but they were a major act in Italy. London-born Shel Shapiro (b. 1943) had broken into music as a guitarist and singer with Rob Storm & the Whispers. He played in Hamburg as a member of the Shel Carson Combo and then became a member of the band backing Colin Hicks, the brother of Tommy Steele, on an extended tour of Italy in 1963 as The Cabin Boys. They got the attention of a manager in Italy who got them to sever their ties to Hicks and rename themselves the Rokes. Their debut release under their new name was a single of ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" that failed to sell. Another recording effort, this time in Italian, failed, but their future releases would all be in Italian, with English-language versions issued overseas. That same year, the Rokes also won second place in a poll of the most popular beat groups in Italy. Their big success and their major impact on the world of rock & roll beyond Italy, however, came when Shapiro co-authored a song called ""Piangi Con Me,"" a hit for the group in Italy and later released in England by the group as ""Let's Live for Today."" That record not only sold more than two million copies, but became one of the most enduring hit singles of its period, with a special meaning to Vietnam veterans, and stylistically, was a forerunner of a sound that Bruce Springsteen would become a star with nine years later. The Rokes never benefited from the song's success in America. They remained an Italian phenomenon, scoring a number two hit in 1967. They remained in vogue in Italy, even crossing paths with the Cowsills at the San Remo Festival in 1968, and continued to chart records there into 1969. By then, the public taste for pop/rock in Italy was changing and the group broke up during the summer of 1970. Shapiro continued to write songs and produce records, forming his own label in Milan in 1977, while the other members of the group eventually left the music business.

The band’s recording of ""Louie Louie"" was a nationwide hit in 1964, and it has remained one of the most popular rock songs of all time.
The band got its start in Portland in 1959 when two teenaged friends, drummer Lynn Easton and guitarist Jack Ely, started playing popular music together. By 1960, Mike Mitchell, on lead guitar, and Bob Nordby, on bass, had joined the band. Ken Chase, a local Top 40 radio personality and the owner of the Chase, a teen dance club in Milwaukie, OR, took the group under his wing, and the Kingsmen became the club’s house band in 1961. Don Gallucci joined the group on keyboards in 1962.
""Louie Louie,"" an R&B calypso tune about a homesick sailor, was written and recorded by Los Angeles singer Richard Berry in 1956 and became a short-lived regional hit in California.  Composer Berry sold the rights to his famous song for $750 in 1959. The song was rediscovered a few years later by bands in the Seattle area. Rockin' Robin Roberts and the Wailers recorded it, and it became a regional hit in the Northwest in 1961. It was that version that became one of the most popular tunes in the Kingsmen's repertoire.
On April 6, 1963, Ken Chase met the band at a Portland recording studio to cut ""Louie Louie"" as its first single record. He called the recording good after the second take. The song featured vocalist Jack Ely shouting into a boom microphone suspended above his head. A thousand copies were released on the Jerden label out of Seattle. While the tune got some airplay in the Northwest, it did not become a hit until October, when an influential Boston disc jockey, Arnie ""Woo Woo"" Ginsberg, featured it as his ""Worst Record of the Week"". Many listeners loved the record, and when it was released again on the Wand label, the record began to climb the Billboard charts, primarily because of sales in the Northeast.
Meanwhile, in August 1963, the Kingsmen disbanded. Ely and Nordby quit the group over differences with Easton, who had to reconstitute the band when ""Louie Louie"" began gaining popularity. After several changes of personnel, the new band included Dick Peterson on drums, Norm Sundholm on bass, and Barry Curtis on keyboards. Easton replaced Ely as lead vocalist. The William Morris Agency took over management, and the Kingsmen recorded their first album and began extensive touring.
By December 14, ""Louie Louie"" had reached number two on the Billboard charts, where it stayed for six weeks, but the obscurity [and unintelligible lyrics] of Ely's vocal performance was causing controversy. In January, a constituent complained to Indiana Governor Matthew Welsh that an obscene record was getting radio airplay in the state. Welsh and his staff agreed that the lyrics were ""pornographic,"" and he asked the Indiana Broadcasters Association to ban the record. The FBI launched an investigation to determine if ""Louie Louie"" violated the federal law prohibiting interstate transportation of obscene materials. After two and a half years, the FBI concluded that it could not determine if the lyrics were obscene because they were unintelligible. In the meantime, versions of the imaginary lyrics were circulating in high schools and college campuses all over the United States, helping to push the popularity of the Kingsmen to new heights.
The Kingsmen continued to tour and make national television appearances. They had another top-ten hit with ""The Jolly Green Giant"" in 1965, but their popularity had faded by the end of 1967 as musical tastes changed. The group once again disbanded. Since the 1970s, original member Mike Mitchell along with Dick Peterson and Barry Curtis have continued to perform as the Kingsmen with other musicians. Jack Ely died in 2015.
""Louie Louie"" experienced a revival when it was featured in the movie Animal House in 1978. The song has been recorded by hundreds of performers and is widely acknowledged as one of the most important records in rock and roll history. ""Louie Louie"" was recorded in one take [some say two takes] for a one hour session that cost $36.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California. Cochran became musician as a teenager, with a circle of friends that included Connie ""Guybo"" Smith whose nickname would later become one of his song titles. He teamed up with [a=Hank Cochran] (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools. They later called themselves [a=The Cochran Brothers], touring the south-western states and appearing on the California Hayride show.

In 1956 Cochran teamed up with Capehart and was signed to [l=Liberty] in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross, spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as [l=Crest], [l=Zephyr], Crash, [l=Vik], along with [l=Silver Records (9)], on which he recorded ""Guybo"", also known as ""Drum City"".

The vehicle left the road and hit a lamppost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover.

Promoted and tutored by an enthusiastic father, she had started singing professionally at the age of seven and made her radio debut aged nine. She became a familiar singing voice on wartime radio and in concerts for the troops. By the end of the 1940s she was an established singing star and she also appeared as an actress in many films of the era working with such stars as Peter Ustinov, Anthony Newley and Alec Guinness.

Petula’s first recordings were Rank promo 78’s in 1949 and her first commercial recording was “House In The Sky” / Put Your Shoes On Lucy for Columbia in 1949. Her first major recording contract was with Polygon Records in 1950 and her first chart success was in 1954 with “The Little Shoemaker”, which also got issued on 45 and 78 in the USA. A series of chart successes continued in the U.K. from the 1950s to the early 1970s including two number ones: “Sailor” and “This Is My Song”. In 1988 a remix of “Downtown” brought her back to the UK Top 10.

Her breakthrough on the Continent was in 1957 with “With All My Heart“ hitting the upper reaches of the Dutch and Belgian charts, and she had her first French language hit the same year with “Histoire d'un amour”. Petula married Frenchman [a1183035] on 8 June 1961, by which time she was already one of France’s top female singers. Throughout the 1960s she had big hits in France with songs such as “Romeo”, “Ya ya twist” “Coeur blessé“ “Chariot” “Que fait tu là Petula"" and “C’est ma chanson”.

In 1962, the German language only song “Monsieur” reached number one on the German charts and achieved gold record status there. She also topped the charts in Italy and Spain with songs sung in the respective languages.

In 1965 Petula finally found success in America with her number one, double Grammy award winning song “Downtown”. She won another Grammy for the follow up “I Know A Place” and in 1966 she became the first British female singer to top the American charts twice with “My Love”. She was voted Top Female Singer by Cashbox music trade magazine in 1966, and again in 1968 by Playboy magazine. Petula hit the American Top 40 15 times in three years.

Petula has continued to record and tour throughout the world. In 2012 her song “Cut Copy Me” hit the Belgian pop charts and a dance remix hit the club charts all over Europe. Petula was back on the British album charts in 2013 with “Lost In You” and in 2016 with “From Now On“. Her French-Canadian album “Vu d’ici” peaked at #39 on the iTunes daily national chart in Canada in 2018, and in 2019, a greatest hits album reached the physical album and sales chart in the U.K. seventy years after her first record release."

Led the most popular orchestra in Mexico during the 1940s and 1950s. Shying away from Latin rhythms, his playlist consisted mainly of American and Mexican pop favorites. He developed a large following throughout Latin America and in the United States as well, where during the late 1940s and early 1950s he consistently ranked number four on the list of all-time favorite bands.

Born Luis Arcaráz Torrás in Mexico City on December 5, 1910, young Luis had two passions: music and bullfighting. Though he became a successful amateur bullfighter, his parents, who both had musical backgrounds, encouraged him to pursue his artistic side. His mother sent him to Spain to study music and engineering. He later gave up his engineering studies. Upon his return to Mexico he found work at radio station XEW, where he earned 36 cents an hour playing the piano and singing. Once established he put together an orchestra which debuted in 1928 at Tampico's Teatro Palma.

Arcaráz composed more than 200 songs during his career, including the scores of many Mexican films. His most successful era was during the late 1940s and into the early 1960s, when he earned numerous awards in his home country and enjoyed immense popularity in the United States. In 1960 he moved to Monterrey, Mexico, where he established his own nightspot, Cita con Arcaráz (A Date with Arcaráz). Luis Arcaráz lost his life in a tragic automobile accident on June 1, 1963, near San Luis Potosí, while traveling to Mexico City.

Famous for her bawdy double entendres, West made a name for herself in vaudeville and on the legitimate stage in New York before moving to Hollywood to become renowned as a comedienne, actress and writer in the motion picture industry. One of the most controversial stars of her day, West encountered many obstacles including early censorship and sexism. Perhaps her most famous quote is: ""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"" When her movie career ended, she continued to perform on stage, in Las Vegas, in England, on radio and television, and recorded some rock and roll albums.

In order to keep her appeal fresh with younger generations, she recorded two rock and roll albums, ""Way Out West"" and ""Wild Christmas"" in the late 1960's. The single ""Treat Him Right,"" from ""Way Out West"", made the album a financial success. She also recorded a number of parody songs including ""Santa, Come Up and See Me Sometime,"" on the album ""Wild Christmas"". West recorded another album in the 1970's on [l33261] titled ""Great Balls of Fire"", which covered songs by [a27518], [a82730] and [a20991].

Mae West is one of the people to appear on the famous cover of The Beatles' 1967 album ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"". When permission to use her likeness was requested, she refused. ""No, I won't be on it. What would I be doing in a lonely hearts club?"" In response, The Beatles personally wrote a letter asking her to reconsider. She changed her mind.

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US. The band continues to tour today, with Whitwam as the only remaining member from the original lineup."

He is the man who introduced stream of consciousness into folk music and turned folk into classical music, and then made it cross the boundaries of Western and Eastern music. The spiritual father of the ""American primitive guitar"", Fahey turned the guitar solo into a metaphysical exercise. He set up Takoma Records in 1959 to release not only his own albums but also Leo Kottke's ""6 & 12 String Guitar"" (1971), an artist with whom he later also collaborated.

Fahey contracted the debilitating Epstein-Barr virus in 1986, which severely hampered his career for over 5 years. During this low period, he was championed by alternative artists such as Sonic Youth and Jim O'Rourke, and 'Spin' magazine included a large article on him by Byron Coley in 1994. The albums ""City of Refuge"" (Tim Kerr, 1997) and ""Womblife"" (Table Of Elements, 1997) marked his return to recording, showcasing a move into avant-garde, experimental, dissonant electric guitar music, far from his previous progressive-folk style.
 
Fahey died on February 22 2001, Salem, Oregon, USA due to complications following a heart bypass operation.

The band originally included only three members (Doug Ardoin, Harris Miller, and Bert Miller), and they were playing swamp pop, but it eventually grew into a 12-piece Blue-eyed soul group. 

The group was disbanded in 1969, but made several reunion gigs before actually successfully reforming in 1991, and at the same returning to perform swamp pop.

From the beginning, the group was lead by Ardoin. After he left the band, Harris stepped in, but left the band in 1964. [a=Clint West] followed, but he was replaced as a leader by [a=Ned Theall] in 1965, a position Theall held until 1967, and eventually from 1991 until his death in 2010. 

From 1967 to 1969 the group was lead by Jack Hall. The current leader of the group is drummer Ronnie Crowley.

After West left the band in 1965, he tried continuing the use of the name ""Clint West and the Boogie Kings"" without a permission and without an actual link to the Boogie Kings. The original Boogie Kings sued West, and forced him to rename his band to ""Clint West and the Kings"".

More than four decades after the formation of the Fabulous Boogie Kings in Eunice, LA, the Museum of the Gulf Coast in Port Arthur, TX, inducted the band into the Gulf Coast Music Hall of Fame. In addition, the Louisiana Hall of Fame inducted the group in 1994. Two years later, the South Louisiana Music Association bestowed an award for lifetime achievement on the band. 

The band's original lineup included guitarist Harris Miller, drummer Bert Miller, guitarist Doug Ardoin (aka Doug Charles), and Maurice Guillory, whose stage names included Skip Morris and Skip Stewart. As expressed above, other members have included Duane Yates, Jon Smith, saxophonist Dale Gothia, G.G. Shinn, Gary Walker, Gary Dorsey, Tommy McLain, Jerry LaCroix (aka Jerry Jackson), and Clint Guillory (aka Clint West). Ned Theall, a trumpet player from Abbeville, LA, came aboard during the 1960s.

With the trumpeter at the helm, the band diverted from its original swamp pop sound to one that was more in line with blue-eyed soul. Another change was the group's membership, which swelled to about a dozen musicians. The changes brought the Fabulous Boogie Kings gigs in Las Vegas as well as three nationwide tours in the late '60s. 

The group also worked as backup to other acts both in the studio and during live performances, working with such artists as Ray Charles, B.B. King, the Righteous Brothers, and Otis Redding. By the late '60s, however, the amount of work available to the Fabulous Boogie Kings had dwindled considerably and the following years saw them perform publicly only for reunion shows. During the 1990s, their return to the music scene saw them revert successfully to their swamp pop origins. In 1993, ""I Love That Swamp Pop Music"" became a regional hit for the band. Swamp Boogie Blues, a full-length album, came next.  

Most recently, in Feb 2016, Master-Trak Studios went into their studio archive and have issued previously unreleased material recorded in 2009 just prior to the death of [a=Ned Theall]. This release features the last known recording sessions including Theall, ""The Boogie Kings, Legacy"" MT 5099-2

The Dell Vikings (also sometimes written as ""The Del Vikings"") were formed in 1955 by members of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Known for being one of the first racially integrated doo-wop groups, they blended their vocal harmonies to produce a distinctive and influential sound. Their 1957 breakout hit, ""Come Go with Me,"" reached No. 4 on the R&B charts and No. 5 on the pop charts, followed by another success, ""Whispering Bells.""

The group split up shortly afterwards because some members of the group were under aged when they signed to [l185836], so only some members could be released from this contract and switch to [l39357]. This led to a split into two separate factions both claiming the Del Vikings name. Despite this division, both groups continued to perform and record.

The Del Vikings were notable for their ability to transcend racial barriers in a segregated era, making them trailblazers in the music industry. Their work not only influenced the doo-wop genre but also paved the way for future integrated music groups."

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it."

Formed by high school students Dave Neumann and Craig Hute (ex-The Blazers), they added Larry Smith and Paul Staack and started playing live shows in the area, including Cedar Rapids, IA and Rock Island, Illinois.  In April 1967 they recorded two Hute originals arranged by Neumann - “I Don’t Know” and “Direction of Mind” - at the Fredlo studio in Davenport. The 45 did well locally, selling as many as 1,000 copies, Once the band was out of high school and mostly attending college, they played shows as far away as Champaign, Illinois and Minneapolis.  Later in 1967 or early 1968 they returned to Fredlo to cut an album of Hute's songs. The band had 100 copies pressed and gave them away. Shadoks reissued the album in 2007, adding a little color to the line drawing that was the front cover."

The Paupers, along with the Guess Who, were one of the first Canadian bands to capitalize on the British Invasion. They started releasing singles in 1965 with a lineup consisting of Denny Gerrard (Bass), Skip Prokop (Drums), Bill Marion (Guitars) and Chuck Beal (Guitars). Prokop and Marion handled all the songwriting chores on their first clutch of singles.

Their early sound was a classy mixture of roots music, blues and folk-rock (think early Byrds or Lovin’ Spoonful crossed with the Blues Project circa 1965). The band began rehearsing 14 hours a day, honing their setlist and evolving into one of the tightest bands around. They hit the hip Yorkville District of Canada, playing to packed out venues daily and in return this gained them immense popularity. Rumor has it that the Paupers blew the mighty Jefferson Airplane off stage one night. In 1966/1967, Bill Marion exited the band for reasons unknown, prompting the Paupers to recruit Adam Mitchell. Mitchell (guitar and vocals) proved to be an excellent songwriting partner for Prokop, and at this point the band set out to create their debut lp.

Magic People has a good mid 60’s sound and is anchored by the band’s folk-rock leanings. There are a trio of good psychedelic sunshine pop fuzz rockers on the record. These songs, Magic People, It’s Your Mind and Think I Care, are highlighted by Prokop’s distinct drum patterns, special guitar effects, and great raga soloing. The only dud on the album is One Rainy Day, which is a jaunty good time Lovin’ Spoonful rocker. The remaining six songs are good to great folk-rockers, that recall the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the Beau Brummels. The catchy You and Me feels like a throw back to a 1965 Byrds or Brummels folk-rock sound. Tudor Impressions is excellent, reflective, and abstract, including horns, sparkling accoustic guitars and a Beach Boys-like harmony pop ending. Black Thank You Package and My Love Hides From Your View have a great outsider feel. Black Thank You Package has a distinct, exciting intro and a catchy chorus while My Love Hides is an absolute haunting masterpiece of acid-folk.

Later on in the year the band would play at the seminal Monterey Pop Festival. Everything that could go wrong for them did. Band members took doses of acid that were way too strong and had equipment/sound check problems. Thus, it was the beginning of the end for the Paupers, a group of individuals who had began with so much promise. In 1968, beneath all the internal turmoil, the Paupers were able to squeeze one more lp out. Ellis Island is a little mini psychedelic gem and fans are strongly urged to check this great album out as well.

The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.
In 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

The Id music group was comprised of members of Jerry Cole's core rock and roll group going back to the late 1950’s. (Cole’s recording with The Champs for their hit song “Tequila” is not this core group, but a lucky outside gig with other musicians.)

This same group went on to semi-prominence with [a2012952] on Capitol records, making high-quality hybrid surf-rock-spaced-out-heavy-vibes on wax.
This experience appeared to be a perfect setup for the odd-time signature freak beat and thematic meandering output of the Id and subsequent material that shows up on what is to be described.

Outside of the Id, that only recorded material for one LP (dissolving soon after due to money disagreements with Paul Arnold), they continued to make records, mostly demo or concept recordings as the same core group. The bulk of the material was original compositions, but also some adventurous cover material was laid down.  

Paul Arnold is thought to have taken the original tapes and flipped the material to various budget labels, including Custom Records and Alshire Records. (Some allege that he literally stole the tapes, but this story may be convoluted or simply false, as some stories have been contradicted by players involved.) 
 
Alshire (and its international offshoot companies) capitalized on these various recordings for several years, including them being the basis for one of Alshire's most desirable collectable records, 
[a282012], and the remix project of those tapes used for the Animated Egg album, drenched in psychedelic influenced phasing effects against strings recorded with authority, and [r=1223427] which has also become a de-facto hyper collectable in the crossover genres of lounge, psych, and space themes. 

The core tapes, that were sold without any of the band members realizing for literally decades (supposedly), found their way onto countless budget records in many different variations depending on the country of release, and were credited to a dizzying array of different artists, most who did not otherwise exist, or wedged in with material by other bands to add more material to their album, one good example being [r621579].

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it."

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

After nearly 60 years of marriage, his wife, Lady Melinda Rose Woodward passed away in April, 2016."

Ortega reached international fame, particularly in Latin America and Spain, during the 1960s.

Ortega became friends with members of a famous group named ""Carlinhos y su Banda"". He learned to play drums during rehearsals and, eventually, he joined the group. A period of wild success across South America followed for the band, with Ortega being one of their most popular members. Ortega left the group to follow a solo career, confident that the recognition the group had given him would guarantee him success as a solo artist.

His first solo album, ""La Edad del Amor"" (""The Age of Love""), was recorded under the artistic name of Nery Nelson. This album, as well as the next one (""Yo no Quiero,"" translated to ""I Don't Want To""), were not hits. Both albums were recorded in Mendoza with low budgets and no recording company to back them up. 
Ortega also used the artistic nickname of Tony Varano for some of his live shows at the time, as he became a member of Chilean band ""Los Lyons"" when lead singer Peter Rock, left the band. 
His interests, however, remained in being a successful solo singer, and he left The Lyons within months of joining that band.

In 1962, he signed a contract with RCA Records, and began recording immediately. 
His television appearances on the popular TV show ""El Club del Clan"" led to a career in cinema. Ortega recorded 27 albums, and starred in 26 films at the time, becoming a teen idol as a consequence. He acted and sang in those films, and shared the big screen with many of Argentina's most important actors and actresses of the time. 

Ortega dedicated his time to politics during the 90s, being elected governor of his province, Tucumán in 1991. 
He also served as senator from 1995 up to 2000.

Ortega received a ""Grammy"" award in 2013.

Promoted and tutored by an enthusiastic father, she had started singing professionally at the age of seven and made her radio debut aged nine. She became a familiar singing voice on wartime radio and in concerts for the troops. By the end of the 1940s she was an established singing star and she also appeared as an actress in many films of the era working with such stars as Peter Ustinov, Anthony Newley and Alec Guinness.

Petula’s first recordings were Rank promo 78’s in 1949 and her first commercial recording was “House In The Sky” / Put Your Shoes On Lucy for Columbia in 1949. Her first major recording contract was with Polygon Records in 1950 and her first chart success was in 1954 with “The Little Shoemaker”, which also got issued on 45 and 78 in the USA. A series of chart successes continued in the U.K. from the 1950s to the early 1970s including two number ones: “Sailor” and “This Is My Song”. In 1988 a remix of “Downtown” brought her back to the UK Top 10.

Her breakthrough on the Continent was in 1957 with “With All My Heart“ hitting the upper reaches of the Dutch and Belgian charts, and she had her first French language hit the same year with “Histoire d'un amour”. Petula married Frenchman [a1183035] on 8 June 1961, by which time she was already one of France’s top female singers. Throughout the 1960s she had big hits in France with songs such as “Romeo”, “Ya ya twist” “Coeur blessé“ “Chariot” “Que fait tu là Petula"" and “C’est ma chanson”.

In 1962, the German language only song “Monsieur” reached number one on the German charts and achieved gold record status there. She also topped the charts in Italy and Spain with songs sung in the respective languages.

In 1965 Petula finally found success in America with her number one, double Grammy award winning song “Downtown”. She won another Grammy for the follow up “I Know A Place” and in 1966 she became the first British female singer to top the American charts twice with “My Love”. She was voted Top Female Singer by Cashbox music trade magazine in 1966, and again in 1968 by Playboy magazine. Petula hit the American Top 40 15 times in three years.

Petula has continued to record and tour throughout the world. In 2012 her song “Cut Copy Me” hit the Belgian pop charts and a dance remix hit the club charts all over Europe. Petula was back on the British album charts in 2013 with “Lost In You” and in 2016 with “From Now On“. Her French-Canadian album “Vu d’ici” peaked at #39 on the iTunes daily national chart in Canada in 2018, and in 2019, a greatest hits album reached the physical album and sales chart in the U.K. seventy years after her first record release."

Carlos describes that occasion as a “bitter, cold day.”
He grew up with 11 siblings, plus three other children that joined the family after the death of a relative.
When he wasn’t singing at home, in the fields or at canals, his father would take him to the programas de aficionados (talent shows) at local theaters. He loved to sing Isidro Lopez’s “Mala Cara.” Carlos sung it so often that he started being referred to by that title within the theater crowd.
One day when he was 16, Carlos and his friends went to an armory in McAllen to see Isidro Lopez y su orquesta. Lopez was ill that night and began losing his voice. One of Carlos’ friends approached Lopez, and blurted out that his buddy could sing his tunes. Lopez replied, “Tell him I will pay him to come over here (on stage) and sing a couple of songs.”
“I was scared like crazy,” Carlos remembers. “He gave me a $20 bill. That was a lot of money. I said, ‘Wow!’”
He sounded strong enough that a musician from Los Continentales offered him a paying gig that night. That was the first band with which he regularly played.
Carlos then got to meet chromatic accordionist Oscar Hernandez through Armando Hinojosa Sr. He accepted an opportunity to record with Oscar Hernandez y Sus Alegres Del Valle for Del Valle Records around 1960.
In the early 1960s, he would still go by his birth name. That changed when his orquesta played at the Ranchito Club in San Antonio one evening.
Some patrons asked the name of the group’s singer. So the MC asked Carlos what his name was.
“I said, ‘Eduardo, Carlos, whatever,’” Carlos said. “So, he used the name Carlos. He told some of the girls, ‘His name is Carlos.’ So, before you know it, the girls were like, ‘Hey, Carlos!’”
A new faction emerged from musicians who participated in Carlos’ earlier collaborations with Hernandez. They were known early on as Carlos Guzmán y su conjunto. They would become better known as Carlos Guzmán y Los Fabulosos Cuatro.
“Los Fabulosos Cuatro,” Carlos said. “Great musicians, great friends and el nombre (that name) fit perfectly. Because during that time, which was the early ’60s, the Fab Four from England came on board. So, as they were innovators in their own way, so were Los Fabulosos Cuatro. They were so advanced in their music talent that other musicians would freak out.”
The original four members were Carlos on vocals, Ramiro “Snowball” De La Cruz on guitar, Armando Hinojosa Jr. on bass, Mel Villarreal on accordion and Balde Muñoz on drums.
“Los Fabulosos Cuatro were a little bit ahead of the times,” Muñoz said. “Snowball brought a lot of experience from different genres to the band. When he brought the guitar, instead of the bajo-sexto, which is usually used in conjunto music, that was something not too often used. They were all great arrangers; everybody would contribute. The voices were great; it was Carlos, Snowball and Mel — great vocal harmonies.”
Muñoz says the name change also reflected that they had gone beyond traditional conjunto music.
“There was conjuntos, and there were orquestas, with a four or five horn section, and we came in the middle (from those two styles) with a different sound,” he explained.
Muñoz would later leave the crew to go serve his country, and Juan Hinojosa stepped in to be the new drummer.
In between touring, the ensemble worked on a new album for Bego Records in 1964. They just needed one final track to complete the release.
They decided to go with an E.J. Ledesma composition that had previously been recorded by Los Cruisers. Carlos notes that they went with it since it had a simple melody and arrangement.
None of them expected what happened next.
“It caught fire on all the radio stations,” Carlos said. “That was the beginning of a long journey for Carlos Guzmán y Los Fabulosos Cuatro.”
That canción was “Vestida De Blanco,” which is still Carlos’ most requested song.
Their success continued when they released Tiempo De Llorar (1967) on Bego Records. The LP featured strong interpretations of the title track “96 Tears” and “She’s About A Mover.” Carlos said “96 Lagrimas,” as it was known because it was sung in Spanish, became a surprise hit in Mexico."

By the end of the year, Bupp, King, Angelucci, and some of the Endells began playing as the all-white Magnificent Seven, a change spurred by the unwillingness of some in both bands to become fulltime musicians, a quest for a new collective sound, and the reluctance of
some club owners to book mixed bands.

Around the time he recorded [r14846903], he was delivering light spirits for the A. B. Carlson Company and performing nightly at the Chelshire Grille in the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Rock Island. After managing the ecumenical Jawbone Coffee House in the resort town of Wisconsin Dells during the summer of 1967, Hansen continued his studies at the Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago before serving as an intern pastor and vicar of the First English Lutheran Church in Austin, Texas, for the 1968-69 school year. By the early 1970s, he had become the youth services director at Smith Haven Ministries, a church-sponsored service organization at the Smith Haven Shopping Mall in Smithtown, Long Island, New York. During that time, he released the album, [r11787503], for the Lutheran Church’s Commission on Youth Ministry. A booklet included with that album featured line drawings by his wife, Sherry. Following a pastorship in the Denver, Colorado, area, Hansen settled in the mid 1970s near Newark, Ohio, and continues his work there 50 years later as a self-described ""hippie pastor serving a congregation in rural Ohio, guitar player, entrepreneur."""

The band originally included only three members (Doug Ardoin, Harris Miller, and Bert Miller), and they were playing swamp pop, but it eventually grew into a 12-piece Blue-eyed soul group. 

The group was disbanded in 1969, but made several reunion gigs before actually successfully reforming in 1991, and at the same returning to perform swamp pop.

From the beginning, the group was lead by Ardoin. After he left the band, Harris stepped in, but left the band in 1964. [a=Clint West] followed, but he was replaced as a leader by [a=Ned Theall] in 1965, a position Theall held until 1967, and eventually from 1991 until his death in 2010. 

From 1967 to 1969 the group was lead by Jack Hall. The current leader of the group is drummer Ronnie Crowley.

After West left the band in 1965, he tried continuing the use of the name ""Clint West and the Boogie Kings"" without a permission and without an actual link to the Boogie Kings. The original Boogie Kings sued West, and forced him to rename his band to ""Clint West and the Kings"".

More than four decades after the formation of the Fabulous Boogie Kings in Eunice, LA, the Museum of the Gulf Coast in Port Arthur, TX, inducted the band into the Gulf Coast Music Hall of Fame. In addition, the Louisiana Hall of Fame inducted the group in 1994. Two years later, the South Louisiana Music Association bestowed an award for lifetime achievement on the band. 

The band's original lineup included guitarist Harris Miller, drummer Bert Miller, guitarist Doug Ardoin (aka Doug Charles), and Maurice Guillory, whose stage names included Skip Morris and Skip Stewart. As expressed above, other members have included Duane Yates, Jon Smith, saxophonist Dale Gothia, G.G. Shinn, Gary Walker, Gary Dorsey, Tommy McLain, Jerry LaCroix (aka Jerry Jackson), and Clint Guillory (aka Clint West). Ned Theall, a trumpet player from Abbeville, LA, came aboard during the 1960s.

With the trumpeter at the helm, the band diverted from its original swamp pop sound to one that was more in line with blue-eyed soul. Another change was the group's membership, which swelled to about a dozen musicians. The changes brought the Fabulous Boogie Kings gigs in Las Vegas as well as three nationwide tours in the late '60s. 

The group also worked as backup to other acts both in the studio and during live performances, working with such artists as Ray Charles, B.B. King, the Righteous Brothers, and Otis Redding. By the late '60s, however, the amount of work available to the Fabulous Boogie Kings had dwindled considerably and the following years saw them perform publicly only for reunion shows. During the 1990s, their return to the music scene saw them revert successfully to their swamp pop origins. In 1993, ""I Love That Swamp Pop Music"" became a regional hit for the band. Swamp Boogie Blues, a full-length album, came next.  

Most recently, in Feb 2016, Master-Trak Studios went into their studio archive and have issued previously unreleased material recorded in 2009 just prior to the death of [a=Ned Theall]. This release features the last known recording sessions including Theall, ""The Boogie Kings, Legacy"" MT 5099-2

King,Blues Is King,1967,37.97,10,"['LP', 'Stereo']","['Rock', 'Blues']",['Blues Rock'],"American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter born September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi and died May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada. B.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.

King is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname ""The King of the Blues."" He is considered one of the ""Three Kings of the Blues Guitar"" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.

In his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname ""Beale Street Blues Boy"", later shortened to ""Blues Boy"", and finally to ""B.B."" 

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. ""Beale Street was where it all started for me"", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]""Miss Martha King""[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. 

In 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song ""The Thrill Is Gone"", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.

B.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer)."

Brother of [a=Pantaleón Perez Prado]. Perez Prado is often referred to as the 'King of the Mambo'.

He was born in Matanzas, Cuba, where he studied classical piano in his early childhood, and later played organ and piano in local clubs. For a time, he was pianist and arranger for [a416581], Cuba's best-known musical group. He also worked with casino orchestras in Havana for most of the 1940s, gaining the nick-name ""El Cara de Foca"" (""Seal Face""). In 1948 he moved to Mexico to form his own band and record for RCA Victor. He quickly specialized in mambos, an upbeat adaptation of the Cuban danzón.
In 1950 arranger [a153472] heard ""Que rico el mambo"" while on vacation in Mexico and recorded it back in the United States as ""Mambo Jambo"". The single was a hit, which caused Prado to launch a US tour. His appearances in 1951 were sell-outs and he began recording US releases for RCA Victor.
Prado is the composer of such famous pieces as ""Mambo No. 5"" and ""Mambo No. 8."" At the height of the mambo movement, in 1955, Prado hit the American charts at number one with a cha-cha version of ""Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White""."

It was Stepney’s studio genius that made Rotary Connection’s mix of acid-laced rock, classical strings (courtesy of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra), and Riperton’s operatic voice hang together. 

The group released six albums during their time together, produced & arranged by Charles Stepney for Chess Records.

Nicknamed the Mayor of MacDougal Street, New York City native Dave Van Ronk was considered by many to be music's raconteur, troubadour, and provocateur. Arriving at Washington Square Park in the mid 1950s during the folk revivalist boom, Van Ronk lived hand-to-mouth while teaching himself to play guitar and dabbling in communist political circles. By 1958, he and life-long friend, musicologist [a666121], released their first album, [l72976]'s ""Skiffle in Stereo"" as members of [a1941172]. After a stint in the Merchant Marine, tireless gigging in most every cabaret in the city, and a one-off collaboration as a [a1916070] on [a869023]'s album of sea shanties, Van Ronk settled on the lower west side Manhattan, in Greenwich Village.

Referred to as “the great, grizzled, guitarist” by [a362340], Van Ronk’s music eluded classification. As a self-described ‘moldy fig’ who eschewed the term “folk artist”, Dave Van Ronk’s eclectic blend of dixieland jazz, ragtime, blues, vaudeville, and other styles were often in direct conflict with the format-conscious world of the commercial music business. Reminding listeners his only constant was, ""I've always been inconsistent”, his recordings followed one rule, “anything that I like and that I think I can find a handle to, I'll take a whack at. And as it has been, so shall it be."" Though more an arranger than a songwriter, Van Ronk was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers toward the end of his four plus decade career in December of 1997. Debuting on [a688836]'s [l20694] label in the early 1960s, Van Ronk moved onto [l19591] with Dixieland revivalists [a1927057] and [l39357] with [a1927050]. At the close of the 1960s, [l30679] released his sole rock album with the [a1927051]. As the folk boom ebbed, Van Ronk’s gravelly voice was relatively quiet, releasing an album for [l1610] in 1972, another the following year on [l31486], then landing on the [l30531] roster in 1976. By the early 1980s, Van Ronk was recording several one-off projects with assorted independent folk labels, including a handful for [a666121]' New England-based [l78952] imprint. Joint ventures with [a1237867] and [a1088718] followed in the 1990s. 

Van Ronk continued performing live right up to his death from complications following colon cancer surgery in Winter 2002. His autobiography, written with [a1914189], and live album, ""[r=2415301]"", which was recorded at the end of his life, were both posthumously released. In the early Summer of 2004, the City of New York commemorated its unofficial mayor’s passing by permanently renaming the eastern side of Sheridan Square on Washington Place as Dave Van Ronk Street. Throughout his life, MacDougal Street’s mayor served as a mentor to countless up-and-coming artists that migrated to New York. [a59792], who met Van Ronk upon his arrival from the Midwest, remembers him as ""Greenwich Village’s king of the street"" where ""he reigned supreme."" Singer-songwriters such as [a406171], [a90233], [a536656] and [a41182] have all sung his praises as a mentor, teacher, and friend. Dave Van Ronk’s younger, west coast contemporary, [a82294], paid homage when stating, ""In the engine room of the New York Folk Scene shoveling coal into the furnace, one Big Man rules; Dog-faced roustabout songster, bluesman Dave Van Ronk. Long may he howl.""

Abnor was paired with singer Robin Beavers, but she quit before the recording sessions were to begin. She was replaced with Javonne Braga, who took on ""Robin"" as her stage name.

Abnor was paired with singer Robin Beavers, but she quit before the recording sessions were to begin. She was replaced with Javonne Braga, who took on ""Robin"" as her stage name. The pair hit the Top 20 with ""Do It Again A Little Bit Slower"" in the spring of 1967. After a spate of follow-up singles that barely made the [i][b]Billboard[/b][/i] Hot 100 (but were regional best-sellers in Texas and the Southwest), the duo released solo singles before breaking up for good in 1969. Braga married [a=The Five Americans] drummer Jimmy Wright in 1970 while Jon, defeated by various legal and personal issues, quit the music business. 

In recent years their two albums and a ""Best Of"" compilation with rarities from the Abnak vaults have been reissued by Sundazed Music on CD and 180 gram vinyl.

Born September 20, 1911, Moundsville, West Virginia, USA.
Died October 27, 1999, Lafayette, California, USA.
Frank's father had a ""pit"" orchestra at the local movie house. De Vol began composing music when he was 12. He was a member of the musicians' union from the age of 14 and worked for his father in the theatre orchestra and doing professional level arrangements by age 16. His instruments were violin and saxophone at first. After his stint in college, he joined Emerson Gill's orchestra in Ohio and traveled the state. Later, he joined Horace Heidt's band and not only was he a musician but also became an arranger for the band. Later, he traveled with Alvino Rey's band. In 1943, he settled in California and started his own band, appearing on KHJ radio and accompaniment to many radio shows, such as Jack Carson and Jack Smith.
With the advent of television, De Vol moved to working on The Betty White Show (1958) and The Dinah Shore Chevy Show (1956), among others. In the 1950s, he broke into movie composing and composed the score for 50 films. In addition, he composed the music for a number of television shows, such as Family Affair (1966), The Smith Family (1971), My Three Sons (1960), and The Brady Bunch (1969). As a composer he was nominated for four Academy Awards: Pillow Talk (1959), Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), Cat Ballou (1965) and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967). . The success of ""Nature Boy"", recorded for Capitol Records, led to an executive position for De Vol at the rival Columbia Records in 1957, West Coast Director of Popular Artists and Repertoire. His second wife was big-band vocalist [a=Helen O'Connell], member West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.

The original line-up featured Dick Belly (vocals, guitar), Joe Markulin (guitar), Mel Pachuta (bass) and Mike Tatman (drums).

The Beinz began their professional career with a devoted local fanbase, recording covers of songs by Them, The Yardbirds, The Who and Bob Dylan. The group also released a version of “The Pied Piper” (originally recorded 3 years earlier by The Changin' Times and which later became a #1 hit for Crispian St. Peters). The group had a reputation as masters of song interpretation.

They signed to [l=Capitol Records] in 1967 and released their only Billboard Top 40 hit, “Nobody but Me” (first recorded by the Isley Brothers, who wrote it). “Nobody” peaked at #8 in January 1968. An album, Evolutions, followed. The Beinz’ next single, “Turn On Your Love Light,” flopped in the US (peaking at #80) but shot to #1 (for six weeks) in Japan and a tour followed. “Turn On Your Love Light” (a hit for Bobby Bland in 1962, and later covered by several artists, including Jerry Lee Lewis) featured “It’s Fun To Be Clean”, a snappy tune reminiscent of the Beatles’ Penny Lane, as the B-side. Later in 1968, Capitol released the single “Hold on Baby” only in Japan where it also hit the top of the charts. Despite their Nipponese success, the Human Beinz broke up soon thereafter.

In 2004, Quentin Tarantino used “Nobody But Me” on the soundtrack for his film Kill Bill: Vol. 1; also, the tune is featured on two compilation CDs: “ESPN’s The Greatest Crowd-Rockin’ Anthems Of All Time” and “J&R’s Music World Presents Rock And Roll’s Greatest Hits Of All Time”). The song made yet another appearance in Martin Scorcese’s 2006 film The Departed.

Currently, a group of four musicians (none of them original members) tour as the Human Beinz, having bought the rights to the name. The “new” Beinz play county fairs and other smaller venues in the Midwest and Northeast."

Carter landed a gig on the Louisiana Hayride during the 1950s, and cut a few rockabilly-oriented singles before joining Roy Orbison's band. He performed on several records with the rock icon and later toured with roots-rocker Ronnie Hawkins and his band, the Hawks - a group that eventually morphed into The Band. Years later, Carter was recruited to play in drummer Levon Helms' easygoing jam-band, the RCO All-Stars.
In the early 1960s, Carter moved to Nashville and became one of the town's most in-demand musicians, playing on sessions such as Bob Dylan's pioneering country-rock records, and perhaps most famously on Simon & Garfunkel's mega-hit, ""The Boxer."" 
In 1968 he purchased the Nugget record label from the country comedy team of Lonzo & Oscar. Carter owned the label and ran his own Fred Carter Studios in Goodlettsville, Tennessee from 1968-1975, when financial pressure made him fold up shop.

In dance music circles, they are best known for their minor hit, ""Streetplayer"", which [a=Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez] sampled for his 1995 track, ""The Bomb!"" (released under the alias of [a=The Bucketheads]).

The Singers are also known for the 30 choral record albums produced in the 1950s and 1960s for the [l=Essex], [l=MGM], [l=Decca] and [l=Command] labels..

Members:
* Ray Charles (1918–2015)
* Wife: Bernice (1916–2002)
* Son: Michael (1941–present)
* Son: Jonathan (1946–present)
* Daughter: Wendy (1950–2004)

The Ray Charles Singers were a fixture on the Perry Como television show for 35 years. In June 1959, the Ray Charles Singers, a name bestowed on them by [a=Perry Como], began recording a series of albums. Due to advances in recording technology, they were able to create a softer sound than had been heard before and this was the birth of what has been called ""easy listening"". Record producer [a=Jack Hansen (4)] used some of the singers to provide backing vocals for [a=Buddy Holly]'s last songs, which Holly had composed and recorded shortly before his death in February 1959. The singers' close harmonies behind Holly's lead vocals simulated the sound of Holly's hit records with the Crickets. Six songs resulted from the Hansen sessions, led by the 45-rpm single ""Peggy Sue Got Married""/""Crying, Waiting, Hoping."" 

On a cruise in 1964, [a=Ray Charles (2)] heard a Mexican song called ""Cuando Calienta el Sol"". They recorded it under the English title ""Love Me with All Your Heart"", and his recording became a hit, riding to No. 3 on Billboard, #2 on Cashbox. This was followed by ""Al Di La"", also a very popular recording. The Ray Charles Singers were not one static group of vocalists; it was different combinations of singers used on records, tours and TV shows. What made them ""The Ray Charles Singers"" was the conducting and arranging of Ray Charles. He generally recorded with 20 singers (12 men and eight women) and these vocalists appeared on Perry Como's television show. The Ray Charles Singers were also the voices behind many commercial jingles. Charles decided to produce a ""live"" performing group to send on the road with Perry Como. The group of 12 singers opened in Las Vegas at the International Hotel and also opened the show for Como at Harrah's in South Lake Tahoe. Charles wrote the music and lyrics for an album produced by the Continental Insurance Company for the New York World's Fair in 1964, titled Cinema '76. It was a companion piece to a 30-minute show about unsung heroes of the American Revolution."

Instrumentally speaking, Mark and Glenn handle both the six and twelve string guitars effectively and with feeling.

Last, but certainly not least, their religious songs are most inspiring and presented in a most enjoyable fashion. 

Vos Cantu Monemus, to us, means three talented, versatile, artistic performers.

They recorded their first sides for Discos Orfeón in 1959, but the label did not release them until 1962 once rock & roll began to become popular in Mexico. They toured throughout Mexico in the middle of the decade, and around this time they also made numerous appearances in television advertisements. In 1964, they made their first recordings for Discos Peerless, often covering the hits of foreign groups to great success. They became one of the most popular native pop acts in Mexico in the 1960s.

Their biggest success, however, came in the 70s, when they stopped covering foreign songs as they started to record their own songs. ""¿Por qué?"" and ""Cómo sufro"" were number-one hits in Mexico in 1972 and 1974 respectively. In 1986, the compilation 16 Exitos (16 Hits) charted in the United States, reaching #15 on the Billboard Regional Mexican chart.

Skinner and Jacobs wrote all 11 songs on Bunky & Jake, and their thematic range stretches from the acoustic calm of ""I'll Follow You"" and the pastoral beauty of ""Country Girl"" to the '50s rock & roll vibe of ""The Candy Store"" and ""Daphne Plum,"" and while the arrangements seem a bit overdone on a few cuts and the mix favors Jacobs' guitar a bit more than is needed, the melodies thankfully win out most of the time.
Andrea ""Bunky"" Skinner and Allan ""Jake"" Jacobs met in 1962 at the School of Visual Arts in New York and performed in the Greenwich Village folk circuit. The duo appeared at the Bitter End on the bill with Joni Mitchell and David Steinberg and were written about in Rolling Stone. In 1965 Jacobs joined the folk-rock band ""The Magicians"", with Garry Bonner, Alan Gordon, and John Townley. The band gained a following in New York and took over as house band from the Lovin' Spoonful at the Night Owl Cafe. The Magicians disbanded in 1967 and Jacobs and Skinner signed with Mercury Records, releasing their 1968 debut album, Bunky & Jake. It was followed a year later by L.A.M.F. The duo released a children's album In 2004, Oo-Wee Little Children, on their own B&J Music label.

Robert John is an American singer-songwriter

John – born Robert John Pedrick – had been recording since he was 12 years old, first charting in 1958 (as ‘Bobby Pedrick’), and then continuing to record through the 60s for a variety of labels.

He recorded ‘Raindrops, Love and Sunshine’ in 1970, featuring his powerful (nearly ear-shattering) falsetto, and an arrangement that owes a huge debt to the previous year’s mega-hit ‘More Today Than Yesterday’ by the Spiral Starecase.

John went on to have a number of hits in the 70s and 80s, including the aforementioned ‘Sad Eyes’ (#1 1979) and even and putting that falsetto to use again in 1983 with a remake of the Newbeats ‘Bread and Butter’ (#68 1983), which came out on Motown.

The history of the beginnings of the Corvets goes back to the year 1964 with the impulse and help of Mrs. Josefina Abitia de Vallarino, mother of Alberto and Roberto, when the group begins its trajectory with the name of ""Los Pájaros de Fuego"".

The first musical stage was with ""Robbie"" García as lead vocalist and guitarist, Roberto Vallarino on the first guitar, Alberto Vallarino on the keyboards and ""Yoyo"" García on the drums. Soon ""Pancho"" Burgos joined as first guitar, Roberto Vallarino playing bass, ""Yoyo"" retired. In those times there were not many artists dedicated to the interpretation of modern music or better known as ""Rock"", which is why there were always changes in the group, always in search of the best available element, the most frequent changes occurred in the drums, for this instrument passed Eduardo Blacio, Amadeo Moreira, Manuel Picon, Fernando Rodriguez, who was always in and out due to other musical commitments he had, in any case, Fernando accompanied us in one way or another, virtually from the beginning . For a short period he was singing with Robbie García, Jorge Chiriboga.

This initial period, quite unknown to most of our audience, was unquestionably the most difficult given that we were constantly and as amateurs, playing for free most of the time on radio stations, schools and parties, it is a time that is remembered with affection and is because since we started we had the great luck of having a great acceptance by the general public.
In many presentations, because the repertoire we had was composed of only a few songs, we had to repeat them because the audience would not let us go. The first songs we played were ""Tu Seras Mi Baby"", ""Diana"", ""Y La Amo"" among other themes of the time, by that time we were playing our first unpublished instrumental track that was composed by Jorge Salomón to which the title "" When the sun sets. "" We always had the luck and privilege of making the group sound good. The interpretive enthusiasm, the instruments we had and the great sound quality forged an excellent taste that always forced us to do things well.

Towards the year 1966, after persevering, we began to have presentations of greater importance, greater and better coverage by the press and we had to present ourselves already in theaters with foreign artists of great importance. We started on television in the program ""Cocktail Deportivo with Chicken Palacios"" and ""Pepsi A GO-GO, we began to work on the image of the group with diversity of looks and well-designed uniforms thus beginning the second stage of the group, there is a turn to a series of presentations of relevance. Already the group, with a greater musical coupling and maturity by the end of the year 1966, Robbie García told us that he had to change to live in Quito with his family and that he It would bring a singer to replace it, it was integrated as well as first voice Marcos Molina. Pancho Burgos retired from the group and was replaced by Alfredo Salomón on the first guitar, as a stable drummer Ricardo Rivera and Alberto Vallarino joined the keyboards, Roberto Vallarino always as a bassist, so the group is integrated by five interpreters.

It was at this time when an artistic entrepreneur offered us a very attractive contract, but as part of the contract itself, it conditioned a name change, the one we had was very long and did not allow us to make an adequate publicity for the concepts of those days, the new name chosen was ""Los Corvets"", there is no relevant story or anecdote, it was a simple change emerging for purely advertising reasons, we discarded the previous name with pain. Fue in 1967 when Jorge Delgado Guzmán managed our first recording for the record label ""Orión"" of IFESA. We arrived at the studio and the lack of experience made the recording a bit complicated and Doña Josefina made a quick change with musicians who had already recorded a couple of times joining the first guitar Roberto Viera, in the drums she stayed this time for more time Fernando Rodríguez, on the keyboards Hans Palacio, on the second guitar and percussion Alberto Vallarino, on the first voice Marcos Molina and on the bass Roberto Vallarino. This was the period of greatest activity in terms of presentations and recordings. At the end of 1969 there was a new change and Luis ""Pollo"" Silva joined the band, in the first voice Gustavo Lanatta who was replaced in a few weeks by Antonio Elizalde, and 10 months later by Enrique González, on keyboards Hans Palacio, on the first guitar José ""Pichin"" Luzarraga, on the second guitar and percussion Alberto Vallarino, Roberto Vallarino on bass. A few months later, Ernesto ""Tito"" Haensel joined the band as guitarist. 

Disgrace occurred in 1972, the month of February, when Alberto Vallarino and Doña Josefina de Vallarino died in a terrible car accident. There was a recess of a few months and the group continued this time with Enrique González on vocals, Tito Haensel on the first guitar, Hans Palacio on keyboards, Lucho Silva on drums, Guillermo Granizo on percussion and Roberto Vallarino on bass. After a while Hans Palacio was replaced by Venancio Larrea in the keyboards. After a long musical trajectory and changes between former members of the group, what is the group today is constituted, Amado Terán in the first, Lucho Izurieta in the keyboards, Carlos Vera on the first guitar, Alonso Flores on percussion, Javier López on drums and Roberto Vallarino on bass."

Born with cataracts and glaucoma, and having several childhood accidents resulting in the removal of both eyes, Charlie (then known as Chuck) attended the New York State School for the Blind. It was there on a coal pile that he found a guitar. Grounded to his room for being off limits, he taught himself to play the guitar, and later formed a band with several classmates and an instructor at the school. Charlie later moved to the Southern Tier and hired a manager, John Parialis, with Pyramid Sound, based in Ithaca, NY. He began touring more widely, eventually being in the “right place at the right time” to fill in for the Eagles, whose transportation failed to get them to their gig as the opening act for Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Charlie’s music and charm impressed members of the band, who offered him a contract to continue the tour. With the stage name “Charlie Starr,” Charlie cut several single 45 rpm recordings as well as two albums, entitled “Just Plain Charlie” and “Tough and Tender.” Charlie rarely talked of his musical career in the later decades of his life, as his first love was Jesus. Abandoning fame and fortune to tune pianos and serve the Lord, Charlie left his musical career and dedicated his music and his life to the Lord."

An unearthly thunk brought eight-year-old Bill O’Malley to the mouth of a garage on White Street in the Hickman Mills area of South K.C. He talked his way into the drum seat for a few songs, and turned out to be more proficient than the group’s drummer. Brothers Terry (11) and Jack (12) Viles handling bass and guitar duties, respectively, and Ray Bahr took second guitar. They paid their dues in the garage for another few years before coining their long, heady name and running through the usual assortment of talent shows, band battles, and sock hops.

In 1968, when O’Malley was just entering Ruskin High School, the half-decade old group had upgraded to gigs at NCO clubs and other military base recreational stages, wearing matching outfits like their British Invasion idols and toting a slickly rehearsed set of covers. The following year, they took their hard-won Uncle Sam proceeds into Damon Studios on 14th Street and cut a full-length LP of their repertoire, running through it quickly under the bewildered eye of engineer Vic Damon. The slapdash results did manage to preserve the energy and enthusiasm of a 21st Century performance. The material style-hopped from Gerry & the Pacemakers to The Animals to Iron Butterfly to, of course, The Beatles, with everything filtered through their punk-anticipating approach. Shortly after the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art cover photo shoot took place, Jerry Lemberger took over Jack Viles’ guitar slot.

The 1969 self titled album, ‘Robin Wilson’ is a minor classic of late 60s adult contemporary pop, triangulated somewhere between Harpers Bizarre, Barbra Streisand and Petula Clark. 

Wilson, a fetching brown-eyed brunette with a cute pageboy haircut and a tendency towards performing barefoot in a sailor suit, was born and raised in Hawaii and got her start working in the resort hotels on the islands. Her rich voice, which could manage both a brassy Ethel Merman bellow and a flirtatious croon, got her noticed by the headliners, which landed the young singer in Las Vegas and on the Merv Griffin Show, (which led to her being signed to A&M Records). 

Robin Wilson also straddled television appearance as herself and as a character
actress, along with music output through the late 60s early / mid 1970’s.

""Better Use Your Head/Bitter Honey"" was a Billboard Top 60 Spotlight Pick on January 1, 1972.

Bodine were labelled ""country rock,"" but their influences from funk rock and psychedelia drew comparisons to The Beatles, The James Gang, and Poco.

Attempting to put together core members of the Daily Flash, Bodine was formed in April 1968 in Los Angeles California, creating a new format for original music compositions.  This union of impressive musicians brought together David Brooks on keyboards from Berkeley, CA; Eric Carl on vocals and guitar from New York; Steve Lalor from Seattle on guitar and vocals; Kerry Magness from Seattle/Yakima on vocals and bass; and Jon Keliehor on drums from Seattle.

The initial development period for the band took place between Many and December 1968 in the Bay Area of California around San Francisco and Oakland.  Bodine moved to Seattle in December of 1968, extensively touring the area, then packed up and left for Los Angeles in May of 1969.

While in Los Angeles they recorded the album ""Bodine"" between June and July of 1969 for MGM.  In September of 1969 they again returned to the Great Pacific Northwest for another tour.

He went To Lodge Professional School, a high school in New York that trained actors (a sort of 'Fame' type place). It seems his main 'skill' back then was his dancing ability. In 1957, he was based out of Bridgeport and was performing locally as a 'hillbilly' singer (doing a cowboy type song  show). He then got involved with shows staged by the University of Bridgeport (around 1958/59). In 1959, he enlisted in the US Air Force and was sent to a base in Texas. No doubt his spell in the air force resulted in him 'living all over the US'. After his stint in the air force was over, he returned to Connecticut and he next turns up in the New York area trying to land a record deal. This he did, initially with Holton and then RCA.
As by the mid 60's, soul type songs were dominating the charts, Holton seemed to have got him to record stuff in a similar mode. In summer 1966, he was holding down an engagement singing in a Norwalk, Connecticut restaurant (accompanying himself on the organ), so his Holton record deal doesn't seem to have raised his profile that much. When signed to RCA in 67, he was sent on visits to radio stns as far afield as Chicago to plug his records. He also had a spell in LA (1968) during which he played lots of live shows (perhaps he was trying to break into acting as well). In the mid to late 70's he was living in Baltic, Connecticut (a small place between Hartford & Providence). So by 1978, he would have been 40 years old and probably gave up his dream to make it as a recording star around then and took a 9-to-5 job."

Arthur, or Arthur Lee Harper, was as mild-mannered a folk-rock singer/songwriter as there was in the late '60s, singing sad songs that emanated fearful uncertainty, as well as slight airs of self-pity and disengagement.

Quique Villanueva does not appear on the single, vocals being performed by Alejandro Arzoumanian because Francis didn't like his voice. When it hit the radio, the single sold more than 60000 copies and kick-started the band into popularity.

In short order, keyboardist Dick Guerrette was added, and Winters left, replaced by guitarist Teddy Dewart. Playing mostly covers, along with a few originals, they got plenty of gigs at local school dances. But finding out that there was another band called the Sensations, a name change was in order. Looking through a dictionary, it was Cooper who came up with the Pandas, and it was a group decision to put Teddy Dewart’s name in front of it. Cooper soon left, replaced by drummer Jerry Labrecque. High school gigs turned into college gigs and club dates (the first was the Intermission Lounge in the Combat Zone), and the band traveled throughout New England, improving their stage act by, for instance, hiring a choreographer to teach them some good stage moves. Then they met promotion man Bruce Patch, who would end up being their producer after insisting that they trim down to a quintet by getting rid of Paul Daly. A 1965 visit to Ace Recording Studio in Boston resulted in two original songs: “Once Upon a Time” backed with “Bye Bye (Out the Window).” The record — first on the Coristine label, then rereleased on Musicor — was a local hit on WBZ and WMEX, and the band started getting some dates outside of New England, but it failed to chart nationally. When a couple of follow-up singles didn’t take off, they parted ways with Musicor, eventually recording the 10-song 1968 album Basic Magnetism on Capitol’s subsidiary, Tower Records. By this time, Dewart had left the band to go to college, and was replaced by guitarist Paul Rivers, but Dewart contributed to the album and got a “guest artist” credit. The album went nowhere, and in 1969, Corelle and Rivers left to form the band Doctor Feelgood (not to be confused with the British pub rockers), reuniting with Sensations members Winters and Cooper, releasing one album, 1971’sSomething To Take Up Time. That was the end of the Pandas. But in 2002 a collection of alternate takes and demos, titled Rarities and Forgotten Gems, was released and the band has reunited for the occasional concert in Beverly, with Dewart on guitar."

Though she recorded more than a dozen tracks only one single dropped: Hang On Bill, written by Berry, Robert, and Gwen Gordy, released in 1965 on VIP Records b/w Puppet On A String. Unreleased tracks include renditions of the Marvelettes' Daddy Knows Best, Honey Boy (previously released by both Mary Wells and the Supremes),  Don't Let Me Off The Hook, Sweeter As The Days Go By, Baby I've Got It, and Memories, Keep Haunting Me.

Still a teen, Lisa landed a voice over job on the Fantastic Four series, using the name Leeza Miller she did both the Nova and Frankie Ray voices on the show that ran from 1967 to 1970 and was Wendigo (a monster) in the Hulk. In 1992, now known as Leeza-Miller-McGee, she did the voice of Charley Davidson in the animated lust feature Biker Mice From Mars.

After Motown, Lisa cut Does She Know for Trident Records before affiliating with Canterbury Records (owned by Mattel Toys) and ran by Ken Handler, the real life model for the Ken doll, Barbie's man. Helen and Kay served as the labels' Artist and Repertoire Directors and wrote and produced for Yellow Balloon, Joanie Sommers, Sandy Wynns, Alex Valdez and Little Lisa, now known as Lisa Miller (not to be confused with the Australian pop & country singer). Lisa cut one album, Within Myself, with Helen and Kay writing and producing most of the songs and released a popular yuletide single, a horrific tale entitled The Loneliest Christmas Tree (1967) that still sells during the holiday season ; the A-side Love Is was quite popular as well.

Her next stop was Cyclone Records where she cut Castles In The Sky b/w Broken Home written by the Lewis Sisters and produced by Bob Mercy. In the late 1980s, Ian Levine recorded Lisa as Leeza Miller for his Motorcity Records' project. Two sides resulted: Sign Of A Heartache and Tomorrow Never Comes/ Lisa does recording projects either as lead vocalist (with Glenn Medeiros) or background; the behind scenes work includes sessions with David Weaver, Craig & Company, Michael Sembello, Jai Cie, and Joanie Bartels. Her biggest recording came via an association with Sergio Mendes; she sang lead on the Brazilian's number four 1983 hit Never Gonna Let You Go.

They are most famous for scoring the surfing documentary The Endless Summer from 1966.

The Sandals began in 1962, when Danny Brawner, a drummer, joined a high-school group called The Twangs, headed up by the brothers Gaston and Walter Georis. The Twangs were a group heavily influenced by The Ventures. At this point, the core of The Sandals was formed: Brawner on drums, Gaston on keyboards, Walter on rhythm guitar, John Blakeley on lead guitar with his brother, David, on bass. David was replaced by John Gibson early on. The band changed their name to The Shadows, and eventually settled on The Sandells, a portmanteu of ""Sand"" and ""ells"", a popular ending for groups at the time. They released their first album, Scrambler!, in early 1964. They partnered with World Pacific Records for the release, which allowed them to come in contact with Bruce Brown, who was then just beginning editing work on his next documentary project, The Endless Summer.

Brawner and the Georis brothers met with Brown, hoping to sell him one of their songs for use on Brown's new film. Brown, however, was so impressed by their music that he agreed to use a number of their songs in the film. It was agreed that all film profit would go to Brown, and all soundtrack profit to go to The Sandells. The group used the studio time that working on the film gave them to release a number of LPs and Singles during this period. Jim King[disambiguation needed] worked with the group at this time, producing a number of songs, including ""Always"" and ""All Over Again"", both of which received limited national radio airplay. The group also slightly modified their name during this time, to the surf-inspired ""The Sandals"". For a time, the group toured with the film, providing live backing for the live narration by Bruce Brown.

After The Endless Summer film reached nationwide distribution, The Sandals recorded the song ""Endless Summer"", one of their first songs with vocals. The song was a departure in a number of ways, and not just relating to the vocals. They were attempting a Beach Boys-esque sound, with mixed results. The also re-released the Scrambler! LP as The Endless Summer, along with new single records similarly retitled.

In 1967, Dick Barrymore hired The Sandals to score his skiing documentary, The Last of the Ski Bums. As on Scrambler!, Danny Brawner's songwriting skills were at the forefront of the album — 10 of the 12 songs contained at least some of his input. However, this album also marked Danny's departure from the band after he refused to leave San Clemente, California, where the band had been based, for Riverside, California. He was replaced by Steve Ekwall, who played on the album.

Soon after the release of the Last of the Ski Bums album, the group broke up. The Georis brothers went on to start a restaurant in Carmel, California; Danny Brawner worked for Mobile Surfboards. John Blakeley remained involved in music, joining Stoneground in 1971.

There have been two reunions to date: in 1994, the Georis brothers and Blakeley reformed the band, and released a few albums, most notably working on The Endless Summer II. In 2002, the Georis', Blakeley, Gibson, and Brawner played at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana, California, to a packed house.

Formed late 50's, active till late 60's
Considered one of the hottest rock bands to emerge from the Pacific Northwest. In 1959, when they were still in high school, they were signed to [l=Golden Crest], their song ""Tall Cool One"" peaked the national charts at #36, and they appeared on such television shows as the [a=Alan Freed] Show and [a=Dick Clark (2)]'s American Bandstand.
At the time, [a=John Greek] was considered the leader of the Wailers, having founded the band in 1957 with a few other kids whose parents were stationed at the McCord Air Force base in Tacoma, Washington. One year later in 1960, some tension grew to an ugly head within the band, and [a=John Greek] left the Wailers. Taking his place was [a=Buck Ormsby], a bassist who originally played with [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. Together with [a=Kent Morrill], these two Wailers created [l=Etiquette Records (2)] as a means to release their own material. Their very first record was a 45 single of ""Louis Louie"" by [a=Rockin' Robin Roberts], another member of the Wailers that was initially a member of [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. This particular single, which came out in 1961, was considered the archetypal recording that inspired the [a=Kingsmen], [a=Paul Revere & the Raiders] and hundreds, if not thousands of other rock bands from the Pacific Northwest to perform the iconic song.
[a=John Greek], the man who started the band, was for the most part forgotten by the music industry. He did a few other musical ventures, including some recording with [a=Gary Paxton], some session work with the [a=The Fifth Dimension], but for the most part, he lived in obscurity, rarely to be heard from again."

Hess' aggregation was intended by Hess to be a ""supergroup"" of sorts gathering members of [a=Weatherford Quartet], the [a=Oak Ridge Boys] and [a=The Speer Family]. The Imperials have had a rotating roster and sound over the years beginning to slowly morph into CCM beginning with [m502239]. 

The group established a relationship with [a=Elvis Presley] in 1966 as studio singers. In 1968, they became backing vocalists for [a=Jimmy Dean]  and did the same for Presley the following year working for both concurrently for a time. The band ended the deal with Presley first after 1971. They set a first for Christian music when they integrated the group by adding [a=Sherman Andrus] in February of 1972. That same year, they stopped backing Dean and from that point focused exclusively on work in the gospel music industry. They would go on to win four Grammys and 15 Dove Awards over their long career. 

The previously all-male group added its first female in 1991 when Armond's sister [a=Pam Morales] took the place of the departing [a=Jason Beddoe] during the recording of [r3884326]. She would remain with the band through 1993. 1998 saw the five original members (Hess, Morales, Nielsen, McSpadden and Slaughter) onhand to accept their Hall of Fame induction alongside later members Blackwood, Andrus, Moscheo, Murray, and Taff.



In September 2004, Armond Morales transferred ownership of the name ""The Imperials"" to the lineup at the time: son Jason Morales, Jeremie Hudson, Ian Owens and Shannon Smith. This version of the group released two albums on Lamon Records, [r12388713] and [r12388798], consisting of re-recordings of older Imperials tunes. That incarnation of the band split up in early 2010.

Currently two touring aggregations use the Imperials name:""The Classic Imperials"" comprising early 80s lead vocalist [a=Paul Smith (22)], [a=Rick Evans],[a=Lonnie Ott] and Michael Schlee which performs mostly in church venues and ""Terry Blackwood and the Imperials"", a trio comprising [a=Terry Blackwood], [a=Darrell Toney] and Lynn Royce Taylor which focuses mainly on events highlighting the Presley connection to the group.

In the Evacuation of East Prussia in early 1945, in harsh winter conditions, his mother first had to flee with the baby boy from the advancing Soviet troops. In 1948, the two also fled from Arnstadt in the East German Soviet occupation zone to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song ""Renegade"" on the album Steppenwolf Seven). Located in the British occupation zone, teen aged Joachim, suffering from eyesight problems, listened to music broadcast by the British Forces Broadcasting Service before his family moved to Canada in 1958.

In 1965, he joined a blues rock and folk music group named The Sparrows (later known as [a407730]), which had moderate success in Canada before moving to California, augmenting its line-up and changing its name to Steppenwolf in 1967. With music that pioneered hard rock and heavy metal, Steppenwolf had international success with songs such as ""Born to Be Wild"", ""Magic Carpet Ride"", ""Monster"", ""The Pusher"", and ""Rock Me"". This was multiplied by the use of ""Born to Be Wild"" and ""The Pusher"" in the 1969 movie Easy Rider.

He recorded both as a solo artist and with Steppenwolf during the late 1970s. As of 2017, John Kay continues to perform with Steppenwolf."

Realizing they are both guitar players, they start a band. The California surf rock craze is in full-swing, so they begin learning the signature surf tunes. They name this band ""The Knight Riders"". Butch and James parents both grew up in the southern US, and with the civil rights movement going strong, the band name was a sarcastic reference to the Klu Klux Klan. This initial line-up consisted of Butch on lead guitar/vocals, James on rhythm guitar, and Greg Mahoney on drums. The band was popular with their high school peers with them often being invited to play at parties. That year The Beatles had their first hit, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and the band decided that they had to keep up with the times by adding Rod Pearce on bass, and Jay Mierly on backing vocals. Greg Mahoney was also replaced by the 15-year old drum prodigy, Mike Lentos.

   The year is 1965. The band manages to secure a recording session at Coast Recorders in San Francisco for the Autumn Records label, with Sly Stone on A&R. A demo is cut with the band playing live in the studio. These recordings were unheard until 2015 when they were released by Break-A-Way Records. The Knight Riders gain notoriety in the Bay Area, most notably in a teen club in San Carlos called ""The Cinnamon Tree"". In early 1966 Rod Pearce is replaced by John Dawson who plays harmonica and sings harmonies along with playing bass. John had already become friends and even sung a few times with Butch And Jay, so they were familiar. Later that year Butch is drafted into the army and sent to Worms, Germany to be a clerk for an officer. Taking the advice from another soldier while on leave, he travels to Ibiza, Spain.

   Butch, now married, corresponds with John about Ibiza, saying that the band must exist in Ibiza, nowhere else. In the meantime, band members are pursuing music in different places. Jay with his brothers Rich and Tom Martin, and John, Mike and James traveling, playing wherever they go. Butch finally returns from the army in 1968, with new song ideas and a drive to get the band going again. Mike Lentos is replaced by Delbert Lang on drums, and the band's name is changed to ""Jungle"". A high school friend of Butch takes the band back to Ibiza in vague plans to record with a European label. After months of no replies from record companies, the band returns to the US on the east coast. Renting a farmhouse in Waitsfield, Vermont, the band takes on it's final lineup. 

   A demo is recorded in November 1969 at Allegro Sound Studios in NYC. Pressing the tapes onto 50 vinyl copies, most in plain black sleeves, band attorney George Seaton uses the demo to land a record deal with Polydor, $30,000 (roughly $220,000 today) for 3 albums in 3 years. However, Butch and Jay leave the band for unexplained reasons, going to Amsterdam and meeting with friends. It is believed that Butch, being shut up in the Army for 2 years had a fear of commitment with Polydor.

   Years later, with the demo and band long forgotten, the Little Indians label acquired an original demo copy and created an unofficial 1997 reissue. The band would likely not be recognized today if not for this reissue, and as such these original Little Indians reissues are highly valued, usually selling for $100-$200. Original first pressings are extremely hard to come by as well, with only 3 known surviving copies, one of which was sold on eBay in 2009 for nearly $3,000."

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

After nearly 60 years of marriage, his wife, Lady Melinda Rose Woodward passed away in April, 2016."

The band began as Jeckell and The Hydes in New Jersey in 1966. The original members were Frank Jeckell, Mark Gutkowski, Floyd Marcus, Pat Karwan and Steve Mortkowitz - all from Linden, New Jersey.

During 1967, they were signed to Buddah Records, where they released five LPs under their own name and a variety of singles, as well as appearing on the LP The Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, which sounded like the usual Buddah studio band in spite of its promotion as a ""bubblegum superjam"". Their first hit single, ""Simon Says"", was written by Elliot Chiprut. During the recording process, the band changed the beat and patterned the song after ""Wooly Bully"" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. ""Simon Says"" soon became a success, hitting #4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The track peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart[ and was heard in the 1968 Frederick Wiseman documentary High School.[citation needed]

The original group disbanded in 1970.

In the years of 1979-1980 the band was briefly resurrected through Jolly Joyce Agency out of Philadelphia with members Chuck Allen, Fred Eyer, Tony DiNiso, Cindy Tritz, Mike Schneider and Kevin.[citation needed]

In 1999, original member Frank Jeckell and Mick Mansueto put the act back together.[5] As of 2019, Fruitgum currently performs its own hits, in addition other songs from the 1960's.

Signed by ABC Records, the trio's self-titled 1969 debut teamed them with producers Ed Kramer and Jay Senter.  Largely written by Grasso and Jonnie, tracks like the leadoff rocker 'Hey Medusa' (which for some reason wasn't shown on the album track listing), 'Make the Children Happy' and 'Babe' offered up a first rate set of hard-rock.  Complete with strong melodies, some excellent harmony vocals and occasional shots of fuzz guitar (courtesy of Grasso), ""Puzzle"" put lots of better known names to shame. Mind you there wasn't anything particularly original or earth shattering to be found on the set, but these guys played with considerable enthusiasm and energy. While their predominant orientation was hard rock, tracks like 'No Complaints' and 'Golden Butterfly' demonstrated a more commercial, though no less appealing sound.  To be honest, the only disappointments were the seemingly endless blues-rock workout 'Working for the Rich Man' and a heavily phased and less-than-convincing foray into psych 'Got My Head Right Yesterday' (which actually started to grow on you given a couple of beers and some time to kill).  
 
Elsewhere, ABC tapped 'Hey Medusa' b/w 'Make The Children Happy' (ABC catalog number 11181) as a single.  Neither the single, nor the parent LP did anything commercially and within a couple of months the band was history.

The group first appeared in a 1967 issue of the comic book ""Life With Archie.""  A year later, the concept was transferred to a Saturday morning cartoon series.  Original songs were featured in an animated ""Archie"" TV series which ran on the CBS network from 1968 into the 1970s. A studio group recorded the soundtrack music and had successful releases under the Archies name. Most of the songs are credited to [a264600] & [a268138] (""Barry - Kim "").  Other material was written by Ritchie Adams, Mark Barkan, Al Gordon, Bob Levine, Bob Gengo, Gene Allan, Ron Dante, Howard Greenfield and Richard Kim Milford. Jeff Barry produced the music from 1968 - 70, after which Ritchie Adams and Ron Dante took over his role. The animated group members were: Archie Andrews (guitar), Reggie Mantle (bass guitar), Jughead Jones (drums), Betty Cooper (tambourine), Veronica Lodge (keyboards). The real lead singer was Ron Dante, joined in the studio most often by Toni Wine (female duet vocals), Jeff Barry (bass vocals) and Bobby Bloom.  Donna Marie replaced Toni Wine in 1970.  She in turn was replaced by Merle Miller in 1971. The backing tracks were recorded by session musicians, among them Hugh McCracken, Sal diTroia, Dave Appell and Andy Kim (guitars), Joe Macho and Chuck Rainey (bass), Ron Frangipane and Toni Wine (keyboards), Buddy Saltzman and Gary Chester (drums) and Jeff Barry and Bobby Bloom (percussion).  Saxophonist Artie Kaplan contracted the musicians and played baritone sax under the keyboard riff of ""Sugar, Sugar"", the group's most successful recording.  ""Sugar, Sugar"", became one of the biggest hits of the bubblegum pop genre that flourished from 1968 to 1973.  However, a non-charting Archies single, ""Love Is Living In You"" is the most coveted release by collectors: Written and sung by Phil Cody and Bob Levine, it features a different group of musicians. The Archies charted seven singles and five albums in North America."

The band name was inspired by the film Born Free (James Hill 1966). Associated with the Bosstown Sound. Line-up:
Bob Margolin (lead guitar)
Dave Codd (bass guitar, vocals) 
Nick Carstoiu (lead singer, rhythm guitar, keyboards)
Lew Lipson (drums)
Mike Spiros (keyboards, trumpet).

The Indigos and the Missing Links performed covers of Top 40 radio hits, but key players sought to move on from both bands in hopes of penning original material. In early 1967, the band began playing at music clubs and fraternities before attracting the interest of Barry Richards, a blues musician who, through his connections with the New York-based Monitor Records, had the Freeborne signed to a recording contract.

The album that resulted was titled Peak Impressions. They recorded 3 of their debut album's songs at ESP studios, and the rest at CBS studios, in New York City. Despite the Freeborne's age range - between ages 17 and 19 - the group featured three capable multi-instrumentalists, who played a wide variety of orchestral instruments including piano, harpsichord, cello, trumpet, flute, and recorder. Coupled with the band's highly psychedelic theme is traces of blues, which Margolin picked-up from watching a Remains concert prior to the Boston act's tour with the Beatles.

The album was released in mid-1967 to moderate success on the East coast. However, Peak Impressions suffered from being associated with the Bosstown Sound, a commercial campaign that advertised groups such as Ultimate Spinach, Beacon Street Union, and Orpheus with the intention of competing with the San Francisco Sound. It began with moderate commercial success. A factor that lead to the album's commercial disappointment was the Freeborne's lack of touring, due to the fact that three members were high school students. The band did open for the Velvet Underground and the Left Banke at a venue called the Boston Tea Party. They also opened for Tim Hardin and Canned Heat at a venue called the Psychedelic Supermarket.

After firing their manager, the group lost their contract with Monitor Records, and the prospect of recording 2 more albums. In late 1968, the Freeborne disbanded though variations of the band continued to perform well into the 1970s. Margolin was the only member of the band to achieve notable success in music after the Freeborne, performing with Muddy Waters in the 1970s."

In 1967, they signed with Atco Records and had enjoyed a hit record with ""Next Plane To London"", which reached #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the end of that year, and #1 in Canada in January 1968.

Born 14 January 1931 in Paris, France; died September 9, 2024 in Lugano, Switzerland.

Sister of [a=Silvio Francesco], married to Erik van Aro from 1952 to 1971 and [a=Roy Budd] from 1972 to 1979.
Her father [a6191982] was an accordionist while her mother Maria was a virtuoso musician (she played 33 instruments) and ballet dancer in Vaudeville.
In 1954 Caterina Valente introduced herself to European audiences with her recordings of ""Istanbul"" and ""I love Paris"". In 1955 Gordon MacRae presented her on the ""Colgate Comedy Hour"" as the ""Malaguena"" Girl. This was followed by the worldwide hit ""The Breeze and I"".
Las Vegas critics raved about the extraordinary talent of the young European vocalist who could sing in 12 languages and she soon found the spotlight on TV, at the Hollywood Palace, and Dean Martin was so impressed he invited her on his TV show at least a dozen times. Danny Kaye, Perry Como and Bing Crosby often featured her as well, along with other TV hosts. In ""The Entertainers"" aired in 1964/65 she shared the bill with Carol Burnett, Dom DeLuise and Bob Newhart and was awarded the FAME Award as best vocalist on American television.
From the mid-fifties to the eighties German, Italian, Swiss and Austrian Television produced more than a dozen series of Valente-Shows and her guest spots over the globe are uncountable. 
Among others, she has performed with Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Ella Fitzgerald, toured extensively in concert with Woody Herman, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Buddy Rich and has recorded with Sy Oliver, Claus Ogerman and Chet Baker just to name a few.
Born in Paris of Italian parents, once married to a German then to an Englishman, Caterina Valente easily related to fans wherever she performed, particularly in Europe. She stormed the charts in Germany with ""Ganz Paris träumt von der Liebe"" (originally Cole Porter's ""I Love Paris"") and ""Tipitipitipso"" that make her becoming the queen of German Schlager. In Italy romantic ballads like ""Nessuno al mondo"" and ""Till"" brought her gold records. The Grand Prix du Disque was her award in France for ""Bimbombey"" and she topped the charts in the US and the UK with the before mentioned ""Malaguena"" and ""The Breeze and I"".
She starred in 12 European movie-musicals; she is a virtuoso on the guitar, having strummed the instrument in an orchestra when only a teenager, and she danced tap dance professionally. 
Major awards from Italy, Germany (2 crosses of merit), France (officer of artistic education), Brazil, Japan as well as the USA (including a best female vocalist Grammy nomination) document her artistic and civil achievements throughout the years with a musical repertoire that included jazz, pop, musicals, chanson and bossa nova. 
In 1986, her 50th anniversary in show business was celebrated with a televised tribute entitled 'Bravo Catrin', and the Guinness Book of World Records recognized her as Europe's most successful female recording artist with over 1350 albums to her credit.
""Girltalk"" was her last album of newly recorded material with harpist Catherine Michel. It was released to international critical acclaim in 2001. In 2003 she retired from showbiz with a last surprise appearance on Italian TV duetting with her son.

Charisma came about from diverging roots emanating from 3 directions. The core of Charisma was Rich Tortorigi (drummer) and George Tyrell (bass player). Both were members of a New Britain, Connecticut soul band called The Mantiques.  In 1968, Rich Tortorigi recruited Tom Majesky to play guitar with The Mantiques. Tom then enlisted Bernie Kornowicz, former bassist of The Last Five, to share guitar and organ duties. The final addition to the group was folk singer Mike DeLisa to sing lead. Tom and Bernie brought the rock and roll element to the Mantiques and Mike brought the band an element of folkiness.

It was in 1969 that The Mantiques signed with Roulette Records as a convenient tax write off to record an album. The album was produced by Ed Vallone and most of the songs were penned by Bruce McGaw. During the recording of the album, the band fought over a new name with their new management. Finally given an ultimatum, The Mantiques became Charisma, a name they hated. The album was recorded at Incredible Sound Studios in NYC. 

During their career, Charsima ended up releasing two albums both  sold better in Europe than they did in the USA. Charisma were offered the option to record a third album for Roulette Records, but let it pass by. Probably for the best, seeing that all the income from the two albums went to Roulette Records and the band ended up with nothing.

In 1976, Charisma disbanded."

The trio, dubbed the Madallions, soon added vocalist Gene Resler and the band played several shows, usually at a local pizza parlor, before they went their separate ways to attend college. They re-formed in 1966, adding new bassist Ron George and keyboardist Roger Swanson. That fall, they began recording with producer Leo Lukla at his Golden State Recorders studio, but due to their studies, they were unable to complete an album until late 1967; the resulting eponymous record appeared early the following year on MTA Records.

The group was originally formed in December 1956 as The Cavaliers, with the spelling was changed to The Kavaliers in 1957 to avoid legal problems with another group using that name. After some personnel changes in the summer of 1959 the group became The Barons. In the fall of 1959 the lead guitarist wrote an instrumental he called Night Shadows that the bass player thought was the perfect name for the group. Assuming leadership of the band and against everyone’s wishes, he changed their name to The Night Shadows on their business cards and quickly booked several months of gigs to make everyone relent. From the fall of 1959 through 1961 The Night Shadows were primarily a Chicago-style blues band.

In 1962 the group changed to a rhythm & blues show band featuring Little Erv (Barocas) & [a2697624], an Elizabeth Taylor look-alike, as headliners. For the next two years, the group became one of the most popular R&B bands for racially segregated Southern college dances and formals. In 1964 the British Invasion changed the group’s primary direction to rock, with Erv and Judy departing the group. Fourteen year old Little [a2563519] was picked as their replacement to front the group in 1965. [a5971431], a studio engineer and producer [a1555330] had worked with on sessions since 1959, had opened his own recording facility and was seeking artists with original material. This gave the group an opportunity to record both the tunes Little Phil had collaborated on and some others that Janoulis had written. The end result was a label deal with [l36601] and a single “So Much” featured Little Phil as lead singer. The other band members were Jimmy Callaway (guitar), Bobby Newell (organ), Charles Spinks (drums) and Aleck Janoulis (bass). The Vietnam draft complicated the group's plans, though another single “60 Second Swinger” was released on [l435647]. 

Due to contractual obligations the group then recorded for [l651570] Records under the pseudonym [a4864125]. This name later became the title of their 1968 psychedelic album on Spectrum Stereo. Due to internal conflicts the band split up after their last concert on Memorial Day in 1969. "

Born: 13 march 1939 Antwerp.
Died:   8 august 1982 Antwerp.

Ferre Grignard started of at the art academy as a painter. He had a fear of flying. He is never been in America and also has never lived in the black ghetto. That was a fantasy story to please the journalists. He lived in a mansion, the birthplace of Peter Benoît, where he made music, painted and partied with the 20 friends who lived with him and literally spent all his money at once.

His debut album ([r=927057]) is a  mixture of skiffle, folk and improvised blues music. After that album and the unexpected international success that followed, things started to go wrong. One example is [a282489] who had a hit with ""Cheveux longs, idées courtes"" which was a copy of one of Grignard's arrangements, but Hallyday didn't pay royalties for it.

Grignard changed record-companies from Philips to Barclay, but the first Barclay-album ""Captain Disaster"" didn't do as well as expected. Two come backs (early and late seventies) failed as well.

He died in Antwerp of throat cancer in 1982, at that time he was living on an attic without heating, surrounded with empty bottles.

His music and legacy has inspired many other groups like [a74984], [a105325] and [a877853] for instance.

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US. The band continues to tour today, with Whitwam as the only remaining member from the original lineup."

Shango's best-known recording was their debut single, a 1969 Caribbean-flavored novelty hit called ""Day After Day (It's Slippin' Away)"" from their self-titled album Shango on A&M. Produced by Jerry Riopelle and co-written by Riopelle, Stuart Margolin and Reynolds, it mocked contemporary doomsday predictions that California was destined to be destroyed (presumably very soon) by an earthquake. The track reached #57 on the Billboard charts in the US. It was actually a bigger hit in Canada, where it sneaked into the top 40, peaking at #39 on the Canadian RPM charts.

Subsequent A&M singles were flops. Shango was dropped by A&M after their first album, but picked up by ABC/Dunhill, and assigned to producer Steve Barri.

A goofy concept piece (any guesses on the plotline), the set seemed to be a clumsy effort to cash in on the public's renewed interest in religion (aka ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", or ""Mass In F Minor"" Electric Prunes).

Material such as the instrumental ""Gloria In Excelsis: Toccata"" and ""The Secrets: Devil's Hymn"" mixed classical moves with chuch choirs and progressive moves.

They are known for their tight vocal harmony. In the 1960s the group had numerous hits at or near the top of the Billboard charts. They are predominantly known as a “sunshine pop” band (a description rejected by some of the band), but covered multiple genres. 

Initially comprised of six members of a 13-piece group The Men - [a720834], [a171375], Bob Page (quickly replaced by [a1016362]), [a821999], [a1351519] and [a1110099] - each member was a vocalist, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Alexander left in 1967 following their second album, and was replaced by [a821997], before returning in 1968 (as [a1230679]), making the group a septet. 

Following their 1969 self-titled fifth album, Russ Giguere left the band and was replaced by keyboard player [a561475]. This lineup completed two further albums before the 1972 death of Brian Cole ended the group’s stability and any further significant success, with members gradually departing through the 1970s, eventually leaving Ted Bluechel as the sole remaining original member before a reunion of the surviving members in the early 1980s.

Inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in September 2003, they continue to perform to this day, with a lineup featuring original members Jules Alexander and Jim Yester, as well as Del Ramos (brother of Larry Ramos) and Jordan Cole (son of Brian Cole).

His debut release was a cover of the [a=Little Richard] hit ""Tutti Frutti"" in December 1955. The song was not a hit, but convinced [l33261] to sign Smith to a solo contract, resulting in three more releases, but still no hits.

In 1961, Smith was recruited by [a=Count Basie] to be his vocalist, a position he held until 1965. 
He also continued to record with different labels, but a hit remained elusive. 
By 1968, Smith's then label, Columbia Records, was ready to release him from his recording contract, when he entered the charts for the first time with ""Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp"", which reached No.2 in the UK Singles Chart and also broke the Top 40 in the United States. 
In 1976 [a=Kenny Rogers] revived the hit as a country song.
Smith changed the first part of his name to O.C. and recorded the [a=Bobby Russell] written song ""Little Green Apples,"" which went to No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won Russell the 1969 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. It received a gold record from the R.I.A.A. for sales of one million records.
He continued to record, reaching the R&B, Adult Contemporary and pop charts in his home country with the likes of ""Daddy's Little Man"", ""Friend, Lover, Woman, Wife"", ""Me and You"" and ""Love To Burn"". He also returned to the UK Singles Chart in 1977 with ""Together"", reaching a Top 30 position.
After CBS, Smith united with [a=Charles Wallert], who wrote and produced the title track as well as the album for ""Dreams Come True"" that returned Smith to the national charts. The Whatcha Gonna Do album, resulted in three nationally charted singles for a total of 40 weeks. This album contained ""Brenda"", ""You're My First, My Last My Everything"" and ""Spark Of Love"". Additional hits ""The Best Out Of Me"" and ""After All Is Said And Done"" established Smith as a Beach Music star. Nominated for six awards at the third Beach Music Awards, Smith captured five.
Smith became pastor and founder of The City Of Angels Church in Los Angeles, California where he practiced for 16 years. One of his last recordings, ""Save The Last Dance For Me"" reached the number one position on the Rhythm n' Beach Top 40 chart.
Shortly after his death, Governor Jim Hodges proclaimed June 21, 2002, 'O.C. Smith Day' in the State of South Carolina. Smith was posthumously elected to the Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame in November 2002.

Although active as a player from the age of 14, it wasn't until the 1960s – following a long battle with, and eventual rehabilitation from drug addiction – that he began to establish himself as one of the very great jazz guitarists.  A brilliant improviser, his early small group recordings featured fluent, bop-influenced, single note lines, coupled with a sophisticated harmonic sense and tremendous rhythmic drive and invention.  In the 1970s he recorded the first of several solo performances in which he adopted a fingerstyle approach to playing rather than using a plectrum.  As well as leading his own groups, he recorded with many of the great names of jazz, including Count Basie, Benny Carter, Zoot Sims, Milt Jackson, Duke Ellington and, notably, four classic albums with Ella Fitzgerald.  The Ibanez company produced a 'Joe Pass' edition in their archtop jazz guitar range, and some years later, the Epiphone company manufactured a 'Joe Pass' version of their 'Emperor' jazz guitar."

He was born on 10 November 1928 in Rome, Italy and died on 6 July 2020 in Rome, Italy. A favourite pupil of [a776673], he also deputized secretly for his trumpeter father in a light music orchestra. He thus developed two distinct sides to his musical personality: one of these led him to embrace serialism and the experimental work of the improvisation group [a146775]; the other gained him a leading role, principally as an arranger, in all types of mass-media popular music, including songs for radio, radio and television plays, and the first successful television variety shows.
After many minor cinematic collaborations, Morricone achieved wider recognition with [a=Sergio Leone]'s series of four Westerns. There followed important collaborations with directors such as [a1549141], [a467451], [a3153386], [a4424119], [a4424126], Roland Joffé and [a4424108]. Despite inevitable self-repetitions over a total of more than 400 film scores, his work provides many examples of a highly original fusion of classical and popular idioms.
Morricone's non-film works form a large and increasingly widely performed part of his output. Many of them use his technique of ‘micro-cells’, a pseudo-serial approach often incorporating modal and tonal allusions, which, with its extreme reduction of compositional materials, has much in common with his film-music techniques.
Among honours, he won the Academy Award in 2016 for his score to [a=Quentin Tarantino]'s The Hateful Eight and has received five Academy Award nominations between 1979 and 2001, a Grammy and a Leone d'oro, and was awarded the Laurea ad Honorem by the University of Cagliari.

Their lyrics and sleeve notes openly and religiously endorsed the use of drugs (particularly LSD) to alter human consciousness for the better. 

The band rattled to the middle of the Hot 100 in 1966 with You’re Gonna Miss Me, anchored by Roky Erickson’s unforgettable yelping vocals, Stacy Sutherland’s guitar, and Tommy Hall’s electric jug runs. According to myth, Tommy’s jug was tuned by the amount of marijuana stored in it.

The group pioneered some of the first garage psychedelia on its albums The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators 1966, and the followup Easter Everywhere 1967. 

However, Texas at that time was an extremely conservative area that still hadn’t come to terms with 50’s rock ‘n’ roll. The authorities and the police set out to bust the entire band for pot (and—not surprisingly—succeeded).

Stacy Sutherland was jailed. To avoid a prison term, Roky pleaded insanity—a misguided ploy that landed him in Rusk State Hospital for the criminally insane for 3 years. That turn of events spelled the end of the band, although there was a posthumous 1968 LP, Bull of the Woods. 

Roky Erickson was released from hospital in 1973 and embarked upon a successful solo career that resulted in a CBS album produced by Stu Cook from Creedence Clearwater Revival. During the 1980s he struggled with mental illness and withdrew from public life for many years. However, in the 2000s he has re-emerged with one of his late 70s/early 80s backing bands, The Explosives, playing regular gigs including the Austin City Limits festival in September 2008, as well as Coachella in California, the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden and Montreal World Film festival in Canada."

They are known for their tight vocal harmony. In the 1960s the group had numerous hits at or near the top of the Billboard charts. They are predominantly known as a “sunshine pop” band (a description rejected by some of the band), but covered multiple genres. 

Initially comprised of six members of a 13-piece group The Men - [a720834], [a171375], Bob Page (quickly replaced by [a1016362]), [a821999], [a1351519] and [a1110099] - each member was a vocalist, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Alexander left in 1967 following their second album, and was replaced by [a821997], before returning in 1968 (as [a1230679]), making the group a septet. 

Following their 1969 self-titled fifth album, Russ Giguere left the band and was replaced by keyboard player [a561475]. This lineup completed two further albums before the 1972 death of Brian Cole ended the group’s stability and any further significant success, with members gradually departing through the 1970s, eventually leaving Ted Bluechel as the sole remaining original member before a reunion of the surviving members in the early 1980s.

Inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in September 2003, they continue to perform to this day, with a lineup featuring original members Jules Alexander and Jim Yester, as well as Del Ramos (brother of Larry Ramos) and Jordan Cole (son of Brian Cole).

The group began as the backing band for British soul singer P.P. Arnold and also featured guitarist David O'List, drummer Ian Hague, and bassist Lee Jackson. In September 1967, only four months after formation, the group split from Arnold, replaced Hague with former Mark Leeman Five drummer Brian ""Blinky"" Davison, and released a single called ""The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack,"" which became the title track of their 1968 debut album. The Nice quickly built a reputation as an exciting, theatrical live band thanks to Emerson, who dressed in silver lame, hurled knives into his Hammond organ to produce strange sounds, and mimed masturbation onstage. Emerson's antics spawned controversy with an adaptation of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story song ""America."" The Nice performed it at the Royal Albert Hall while trying to burn a replica of an American flag, and Bernstein subsequently attempted to stop the song's release in the U.S., although it was released in edited form on the U.S. release of their second album Ars Longa Vita Brevis.

Emerson had emerged as the star of the group, both in terms of instrumental skill and showmanship, O'List, who had become erratic and unreliable had departed the group before the release of Ars Longa Vita Brevis to join the Misunderstood and subsequently Roxy Music. The reduction of the Nice to a trio allowed the band to further explore fusing rock with jazz and classical music, most notably with an adaptation of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No 3 titled ""Acceptance Brandenburger"".

Nice and Five Bridges became big hit albums in Britain, but the group never broke through in America. In 1969, Emerson met Greg Lake, then with King Crimson, on a U.S. tour, and broke up the Nice in frustration in 1970 due to its lack of success. He, Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer formed the much more popular Emerson, Lake and Palmer, which expanded on Emerson's innovations with the Nice. After the Nice, Lee Jackson formed Jackson Heights which recorded four albums between 1970-1973 and Brian Davison formed the short lived band Every Which Way and was in a mid 70's line up of Gong. Davison and Jackson formed Refugee with keyboardist Patrick Moraz, this was however short lived as the group disbanded after Moraz was invited to replace Rick Wakeman in Yes. In 2002 and 2003 Emerson, Jackson and Davison reunited for a one off Nice tour in the UK."

His music combines blues, pop, jazz, boogie woogie and rock and roll.

Rebennack began playing the piano at the age of six and, as he grew up, he became strongly influenced by the style of [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1394017-Henry-Roeland-Byrd]Roy Byrd[/url] (aka Professor Longhair). He immersed himself in the music and voodoo cultures of New Orleans, where he became known as [a=Mac Rebennack], playing the organ in strip-clubs with 'make-up' bands in the French Quarter.

However, it was as a session guitarist with [a=John Vincent]'s Ace Records that gave him his first break, around 1957. He worked with the New Orleans R&B session crew at Crescent City's '[a=Cosimo V. Matassa]' studio and with an 'All For One' co-operative formed by [a=Harold Battiste]- cutting Storm Warning (Rex, 1957) and singles on Ace, Rex and AFO (an acronym of All For One) .

Rebennack then moved to California in 1962 with Battiste's crew, where they played on [a=Sam Cooke]'s final recording session. Rebennack subsequently undertook a lot of session work around LA (appearing briefly for a Freak Out! album session with [a=Frank Zappa]) and developed his Mardi Gras persona of Dr. John Creaux The Night Tripper with Battiste's help, assembling the Gris-Gris album whilst sessioning for [a=Sonny & Cher].

His drawled and ponderous style, tinged with a husky Southern Comfort delivery, caught the mood of the moment upon the album's release in 1968 giving him the commercial freedom to explore the many facets of the Louisiana blues and Memphis funk cultures in following releases. His recordings have been supported by such alumni as Clapton, Jagger, Allen Toussaint, The Meters, Jerry Wexler and Mike Bloomfield. He had a top-ten hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, and he appeared in the Martin Scorsese film The Last Waltz (1978).

Dr. John kept touring and releasing records. He unexpectedly passed away of a sudden, massive heart attack on June 6, 2019."

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista.

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].
The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.
In 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).
They were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.

Beginning with their 1968 debut album they broke tradition by using classical music instruments in rock songs and rock instruments in classical pieces. This fusion, daring at the time, impressed legendary conductor [a=Leonard Bernstein] so much that he invited the group to appear at one of his Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra where they performed their signature song ""Brandenburg"", based on the first movement of Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto.

Brandenburg appeared on the group's second LP ""Faithful Friends"" (1969). This LP had higher production values than their first and contained many of the songs that were part of their live act.  Their third album, ""Reflections"" (1970), was actually recorded prior to Faithful Friends and was a collaboration with Greek composer [a=Manos Hadjidakis] on the score for a film that was never produced.  Rhythm guitarist Brian Corrigan departed after the third album and after being part of the only movie appearance by the group, ""Zachariah"".

The band then shortened its name to The New York Rock Ensemble and switched to Columbia Records.  Roll Over (1971) was their most overtly rock album and, at that time, their biggest seller.  Their album Freedomburger (1972) was an uneven collection of songs. Soon after the tour supporting this album the band dispersed.

In 1965, Paxton founded his own Hollywood recording studio, and by the late 1960s, Paxton was regularly licensing material to Alshire, and at Sherman's request, he put together the California Poppy Pickers to capitalize on the growing country-rock trend. Comprised of singers/multi-instrumentalists [a7016654] and [a=Dennis Payne], along with pedal steel guitarist [a=Leo LeBlanc], the group released three 1969 LPs -- Sounds of '69, Hair/Aquarius, and Today's Chart Busters comprised primarily of covers and thinly-veiled rewrites. 

For reasons unknown, the fourth and final California Poppy Pickers album, [r1896248], was recorded without Paxton's involvement, and featured an entirely different lineup -- singer/guitarist Mike Messer, singer/bassist Don Larson, guitarist Randy Wilcox, and drummer Tom Slipp were, in reality, a Christian rock band called the [a=Wilson McKinley], and they used the proceeds from their lone Alshire date to fund a self-released 1970 date titled Jesus People's Army: On Stage.

A selection of their output is also available via disc 2 of the [r11604767] 3CD.

Played both guitar and banjo, and began working the bars in Cincinnati with Willard Hale, with whom he later made some recordings on Starday. He acquired his nickname because people in the clubs assumed that the name inscribed on his second-hand guitar was his. Rusty became Jimmie Skinner’s right hand man, working in his record store as well as playing banjo, resonator guitar, and electric lead guitar with Jimmie as the occasion demanded. He cut some rockabilly sides for Gateway and King; “Sugaree” on Chess became a national hit. An original banjo instrumental on Mercury was called “Dixie Strut.” He also recorded as Rusty York and the Kentucky Mountain Boys with Curly Tuttle on mandolin, Billy Thomas on fiddle, Bill Lanham on guitar, Herman Kress on bass, and himself on banjo. He fronted Bobby Bare’s band for a while and worked in Las Vegas, but eventually decided his future lay in his Jewel Recording Studio, which he began in his garage in 1961 and later moved to 1594 Kinney Avenue in the Cincinnati suburb of Mt. Healthy. The studio has been the site for many excellent bluegrass, country, and gospel recordings for a variety of labels, but was closed in 2008 when Rusty retired."
