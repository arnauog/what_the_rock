Influential on later artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and many others. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).
Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California. Cochran became musician as a teenager, with a circle of friends that included Connie ""Guybo"" Smith whose nickname would later become one of his song titles. He teamed up with [a=Hank Cochran] (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools. They later called themselves [a=The Cochran Brothers], touring the south-western states and appearing on the California Hayride show. They recorded two hillbilly records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting [a=Elvis Presley] on the Dallas Big D Jamboree show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise"", their third recording on Ekko and a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of [a=Jerry Capehart].
In 1956 Cochran teamed up with Capehart and was signed to [l=Liberty] in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross, spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as [l=Crest], [l=Zephyr], Crash, [l=Vik], along with [l=Silver Records (9)], on which he recorded ""Guybo"", also known as ""Drum City"". He also appeared in two films.
Following up on his increasing American success, Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with [a=Gene Vincent] and [a=Ronnie Hawkins] to appear on popular TV and radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon [a=Shari Sheeley], later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.
On Sunday, April 17, 1960 — the day following the tour — Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car, also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat, and driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lamppost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs and collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries, aged 21. Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother [a=Bob Cochran], entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock'n'roll come of age in the UK."

At the time, [a=John Greek] was considered the leader of the Wailers, having founded the band in 1957 with a few other kids whose parents were stationed at the McCord Air Force base in Tacoma, Washington. One year later in 1960, some tension grew to an ugly head within the band, and [a=John Greek] left the Wailers. Taking his place was [a=Buck Ormsby], a bassist who originally played with [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. Together with [a=Kent Morrill], these two Wailers created [l=Etiquette Records (2)] as a means to release their own material. Their very first record was a 45 single of ""Louis Louie"" by [a=Rockin' Robin Roberts], another member of the Wailers that was initially a member of [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. This particular single, which came out in 1961, was considered the archetypal recording that inspired the [a=Kingsmen], [a=Paul Revere & the Raiders] and hundreds, if not thousands of other rock bands from the Pacific Northwest to perform the iconic song.
[a=John Greek], the man who started the band, was for the most part forgotten by the music industry. He did a few other musical ventures, including some recording with [a=Gary Paxton], some session work with the [a=The Fifth Dimension], but for the most part, he lived in obscurity, rarely to be heard from again."

He played the violin as a child and took up the guitar and the double bass as a teenager. He continued with the latter as a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra and studied orchestration at Temple University. He enlisted in the Navy in 1945 and became bandleader of the Regular Navy Dance Band in Bainbridge, Maryland. He was discharged in 1946 because his father, who had been diagnosed with cancer, could no longer support his family. Virtue considered putting together a big band but, due to financial constraints, assembled an amplified trio instead, with Ralph Frederico on the piano and Steve Rossi on the guitar. Virtue named the band the Virtuoso Trio after their formation in 1947. In 1958, he was founder member of American rock 'n' roll band [a318678] from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Their first single Guitar Boogie Shuffle (a re-arrangement of Arthur Smith's Guitar Boogie) became a hit in 1958.

Mitchell was born Albert  George Cernik to Croatian immigrants February 22, 1927  in Detroit, Michigan. The family moved when he was 11 to Los Angeles then to San Francisco where, after leaving school, he worked as a saddle maker, supplementing his income by singing. Dude Martin, who had a country music broadcast in San Francisco, hired him for his band.

Cernik served in the United States Navy for two years in World War II, then sang with Carmen Cavallaro's big band. In 1947 he recorded for Decca with Cavallaro's band, but left due to food poisoning. He went next to New York City and made records for King Records as Al Grant (one, ""Cabaret"", appeared in the Variety charts). He won on the radio show Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1949 as a soloist.

Mitch Miller at Columbia records signed him in 1950 and urged him to change his name. Miller originally had intended to record a sentimental ballad called ""My Heart Cries for You"" and ""The Roving Kind"" with Frank Sinatra, however, Sinatra was not interested and rejected the songs. Mitchell recorded them and ""My Heart Cries for You"" became Mitchell's first hit song, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts. He continued with hits including ""Heartaches by the Number"" (#1 US), ""Rock-a-Billy"" (a crossover into the rock and roll field), ""The Same Old Me"" and the gigantic ""Singing the Blues"", which was number one for 10 weeks in 1956. He toured the world and had hits globally, especially in the UK and Australia. He placed nine songs in the US Top 10, 20 songs into the UK Top 10 (including 8 number ones) and 19 songs in the Australian Top 10 (including 3 number ones).

In the 1950s and 1960s Mitchell acted in such movies as Those Redheads From Seattle (1953) and Red Garters (1954), on television and hosted his own television show in 1957.

Mitchell's popularity waned in the 1960s, although he continued to record songs for a number of labels. In 1990, he appeared in several episodes of the BBC drama series Your Cheatin' Heart as the fictional country singer Jim Bob O'May, singing several standards including his own hit ""Singing the Blues"".

Mitchell died on July 1, 1999, aged 72, at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada of complications from cancer surgery.

His song ""Heartaches by the Number"" was part of the soundtrack of the 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas.

Next came a stint with [a=Fred Waring], where they recruited [a=Ralph Brewster] to make it a quartet. In 1937 they joined [a299946]'s musical organization where they were featured on his radio show, and recorded many of the classic songs of that era, a few with Jack Teagarden. Their biggest break came in 1939 when Glenn Miller engaged them to record a tune called ""It's Make Believe Ballroom Time,"" a sequel to the original ""Make Believe Ballroom,"" which they had recorded earlier for Martin Block's Big Band Show of the same name, on WNEW New York. Soon after, Glenn Miller made the Modernaires a part of his big band. [a=Paula Kelly] (Mrs. Hal Dickenson) was added to the group, making it a quintet."

In 1949, brothers Rudy and Bernard West joined another set of singing brothers, Ripley and Raphael Ingram, to form gospel quartet [b]The Sentimental Four[/b]. Inspired by the harmonies of The Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots, they soon began to shift toward R&B.

The young foursome toured briefly with Miller's Brown-Skinned Models, an all-black revue that played fairs and carnivals. The act started winning local talent contests and those victories led to a chance to perform at the Apollo Theatre in New York City where the group won a contest as well. Soon after, Los Angeles-based [l=Aladdin Records] signed the group. After a few lineup changes that included adding a fifth member, the combo renamed itself The Five Keys. 

""[i]Ling, Ting, Tong[/i],"" was a number 28 pop hit in 1954. That was followed by the ballad ""[i]Out of Sight, Out of Mind[/i],"" which reached number 23 in 1956 and ""[i]Wisdom of a Fool[/i]"" which hit number 35 in 1957. However, the group's influence was greater than the best-sellers would indicate.

Before black groups started crossing over onto pop charts, The Five Keys had a powerful effect on R&B music especially among vocal harmony acts. ""One of the most popular, influential and beautiful-sounding R&B singing groups of the 1950s, The Five Keys were not only a link between the gospel/pop units of the '40s and the later R&B and rock groups, they led by example, having hits in R&B, rock 'n' roll, and pop before the decade was through,"" wrote Jay Warner in the [u]Billboard Book of American Singing Groups[/u]."

The group also included Eddie Lewis (tenor, Ward's cousin), Charles Fizer (tenor), Walter Hammond (baritone), and Melvin King (bass) and except for Lewis were friends in a Los Angeles, California, high school
Their first record was credited to Walter Ward and the Challengers (""I Can Tell"" on Melatone Records). After the name change, they recorded ""Western Movies"" (Demon Records) in the summer of 1958. Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s. The Olympics continued to perform on the oldies circuit in the United States and other countries.

Eddie Lewis, tenor singer and last original member of the Olympics, died on May 31, 2017.

The Five Satins are best known for the doo wop classic ""In The Still Of The Night"", a song that was popular enough to make the group one of the most famous doo wop outfits, although they never had another hit of the same magnitude.

The origins of the Five Satins lie in the Scarlets, a New Haven, CT, doo wop group led by Fred Parris. The Scarlets formed in 1953, while Parris was still in high school. The group had a local hit with ""Dear One"" the following year. In 1954, Parris formed the Five Satins with vocalists Al Denby, Ed Martin, and Jim Freeman. Within the next year, Parris had the group record ""In The Still Of The Night,"" a song he had recently written in the basement of a local church. The first single the group released was ""In The Still Of The Night"". The single was released on Standard Records in the spring of 1956. By the end of the year, it had been leased to Ember and became a huge hit, peaking at number three on the R&B charts and number 25 on the pop charts."

A native of Southern California, Kathy Young was born in the Orange County seat, Santa Ana, and rose to stardom in 1960 when Jim Lee, a producer at Indigo Records who, two years earlier, organized the Sun Valley-based band, The Innocents, and arranged their appearance on Wink Martindale's pop music TV show, asked them to sing backup vocals for her on the cover version of the song which had been a hit in 1954 for The Rivileers, ""A Thousand Stars"". In December, two months after her 15th birthday, Kathy Young and The Innocents peaked at #6 on the Black Singles chart, and at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Young's follow-up was ""Happy Birthday Blues"", which hit #30 on the Hot 100 in 1961. Subsequent singles, such as ""Magic Is the Night"" and ""The Great Pretender"", missed the Top 40.
In July 1961, Kathy Young joined top performers Brenda Lee, The Shirelles, Bobby Vee, Etta James, Gene McDaniels, The Ventures, Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry, The Fleetwoods, The Innocents and Jerry Lee Lewis on DJ Alan Freed's highly-publicized new American road show.
In 1962 she followed Brenda Lee to Monogram Records, recording solo and with Chicano rock singer Chris Montez. Still a teenager, she saw her promising career slowing to a standstill and, in 1964, traveled to London where she married American singer-songwriter John Maus, whose stage name was John Walker. The marriage to Maus, remembered as the founder of The Walker Brothers, a pop group most successful in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom, lasted from 1965 to 1968.
Returning to the U.S. in 1969, she remarried two years later and over the next twenty years raised children and helped manage the family citrus ranch in Central California. After a move back to Los Angeles in 1994, she began working for a major international company, while also coming home to her original passion, music and, in the 2000s, performing on numerous rock shows at venues such as the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and New Jersey's Izod Center at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.

Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s.

He had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including “Just Ask Your Heart” (#7), “I’ll Wait For You” (#15), “Bobby Sox To Stockings” (#8), and “A Boy Without A Girl” (#10). Most of his hits were written and produced by [a=Robert P. Marcucci], head of [l=Chancellor] Records. With other Teen Idols (including [a=Paul Anka], [a=Fabian (6)], [a=Ricky Nelson (2)] and [a=Bobby Rydell]) he performed on TV music shows such as [a=Dick Clark (2)]’s “American Bandstand”, and on stage revues. 
With [a=Annette Funicello] he starred in a number of “beach party” comedy films during the mid-1960s. Later he performed in other films in more romantic roles, as well as straight dramatic parts in the [a=John Wayne] historical western film “The Alamo”, or the 1961 science-fiction story “Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea” with [a=Barbara Eden]. Avalon also often appeared as himself in nearly two dozens of TV episodes, including ABC’s “The Bing Crosby Show” and “The Patty Duke Show”. Later he became a national television spokesperson for Sonic Drive-In. In 1965 he appeared in the Combat! episode “Brother, Brother” as a childhood friend of Pfc. Kirby, played by Jack Hogan. In the 1978 film “Grease” he performed “Beauty School Dropout” as a character called Teen Angel. 
Following an appearance on “American Bandstand” anniversary broadcast, Avalon, Fabian, and Bobby Rydell went on several long running tours of the US in the 1980s and 1990s, performing their old hits and medleys of other songs. 
Married to Kathryn Diebel since January 19, 1963, they have 8 children and 10 grandchildren. Sons Frankie Jr. (drummer) and Tony (guitarist) play on tour with Avalon."

Britain's most successful home-grown pop star, he has had more than 130 singles, albums and EP's make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist.  He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with [a27518]) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's–2000's).

He was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, ""The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook""."

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973.

One of the earliest of all Motown groups The Miracles were formed at school in Detroit in 1955 as The Five Chimes. In 1956 they changed their name to The Matadors, adding Claudette Rogers to the line-up. They were spotted by Berry Gordy at an audition in late 1957 and in February 1958 changed their name to The Miracles. Their first release, 'Got A Job' b/w 'My Mama Done Told Me', was issued via the End label that same month. Another single on End followed, and then one on Chess and Motown, before the group finally found a home on Tamla where they had a string of hits and Smokey established himself as a key songwriter for the label throughout the 1960s. 

In late 1965 Berry Gordy decided to adjust the group's name and they were billed thereafter as Smokey Robinson & The Miracles although it was still one group, until Smokey left the group in July 1972 (although the final Smokey Robinson & The Miracles single was not released until November). He was replaced by Billy Griffin, with the name being reverted back to The Miracles for the new line-up. 

The Miracles stayed with Motown until 1976, and had a number one US hit with 'Love Machine' in 1975. In 1976 they moved to Columbia.

The group also included Eddie Lewis (tenor, Ward's cousin), Charles Fizer (tenor), Walter Hammond (baritone), and Melvin King (bass) and except for Lewis were friends in a Los Angeles, California, high school
Their first record was credited to Walter Ward and the Challengers (""I Can Tell"" on Melatone Records). After the name change, they recorded ""Western Movies"" (Demon Records) in the summer of 1958. Co-written by Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith, ""Western Movies"" made it to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song reflected the nation's preoccupation with western themed movies and television programs. It told the story of a man who lost his girl to TV westerns, and it included doo-wop harmonies as well as background gunshots and ricochet sound effects.

In 1959, the group recorded ""(Baby) Hully Gully,"" which initiated the Hully Gully dance craze. ""Big Boy Pete,"" which the group released in 1960,[1] served as inspiration for The Kingsmen's ""The Jolly Green Giant"". Over the next ten years The Olympics recorded upbeat R&B songs, often about dances popular at the time.

In 1965, The Olympics were one of the first to record ""Good Lovin'"", penned by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick. In 1966, The Young Rascals version rose to No. 1 on the US Hot 100. Since then, many recorded versions have been made by prominent artists, including Mary Wells, The Ventures, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bobby McFerrin and The Bobs.

Fizer was shot and killed during the Watts riots in 1965.Shortly thereafter, King left the group after his sister died in an accidental shooting.[citation needed] A revamped group continued to record into the early 1970s but were unable to attain popular chart success after the mid 1960s. The Olympics continued to perform on the oldies circuit in the United States and other countries.

Eddie Lewis, tenor singer and last original member of the Olympics, died on May 31, 2017.

Born 16 January 1923 in Corbin, Kentucky,  USA.

Lanham had an over fity-year career in music. In 1939, Lanham auditioned for Archie Campbell as the country music star was coming through town and performed well enough that after receiving his parent's permission, the 16-year old left town with Campbell's troupe the next day. He moved on to WNOX Radio in Knoxville, Tennesse and became well-versed in jazz standards. Next, Lanham and the Whippoorwills played (and sometimes sang) in every episode of the Smiley Burnette radio show.
As a studio musician, Lanham played on the debut recordings of Chet Atkins (""Guitar Blues"", 1946) and Loretta Lynn (""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl"", 1960) and also played rhythmg on the Fleetwood's 1959 pop hit ""Mr. Blue"". He played with the Sons of Pioneers for 25 years (1961-1986).
Lanham had respect as a great guitarist by other players including Chet Atkins, Merle Travis, Barney Kessel and more. Rich Kienzle, journalist and historian, points out Lanham’s unique contribution that set him apart from the other country-jazz guitar giants: ""The Lanham style, harmonically richer, combined both single-note passages with luxuriant chord melodies.  The vibrant four-part harmonies he created for his chord solos were his own idea, an improvement upon three-part harmonies he heard Western swing guitarist Sheldon Bennett play."""

Partial history by Jerry Armstrong (guitar player):
""We formed the group while serving in the U.S. Navy at Boca Chica Naval Air Station, Key West Florida. We first practiced in the old base theater, beginning our trek in 1958. In 1959 we were transferred to the U.S.S. Independence, CVA-62 (Aircraft Carrier) and served aboard her until we were all discharged in 1962. We made two trips to Europe on the Indy and during the first trip entered a rock and roll contest in France and won first place. Eddie Barclay, the International Banker, saw us and liked us and signed us to a recording contract with his Barclay Records label. We later recorded for ATCO in New York City. While the band did well up and down the East Coast of the U.S. from Key West to New York City, we were most popular in Europe, with France, Greece, and Italy being countries that most favored our music. We cut several albums and EPs. In 1963, the band split and members went separate ways. Rocker Roberts took the band's name and went back to Europe where he did very well in the music business with new members. Most of us went on to other careers. I played guitar with various groups for a while. However, I retired from the Federal Government after 30 years as a personal officer and family support center director, having earned degrees in psychology and counseling. Don Borja, the bass player also made a career working with the government and designed many of the emblems and symbols used in the government today, including the seal of the department of defense. Charlie Barron became a music teacher (Piano). My attempts to contact Jerry Hendrix, Fred Lawrence, and others have been without success. While we did go back to Key West and perform on a couple of occasions, we actually left there in 1959 and never returned there except for two performances--I believe about 1960/61. We were front band for Bobby Darren on one of those trips, playing at a large music hall at Biscayne Park. The performances in Key West included members of the Grand Ole Opry (Little Jimmy Dickens, Cowboy Copas, Hank Locklin, and a few others)."""

Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an ""adult"" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics; by and large, his songs were sensitive and sensual, which is part of the reason why he achieved such a large success. Once Twitty reached the top of the country charts in the late '60s, he stayed there for years on end, releasing a consistent stream of Top Ten hits that both defined and expanded the limitations of country-pop by adding subtle R&B, pop, and rock & roll influences. Though he had some pop success, Twitty remained country to the core; occasionally, his song titles were simply too corny, which was why he retained his popularity until his death in 1993, aged 59.

Luther married Clarencia Mae Flynn on April 5, 1959. They had four daughters and one son. Luther and Clarencia also adopted another daughter Denise and brought her into their large family. Luther‘s thirst for music came from his mother who played the piano for the African Methodist Church in Columbia, South Carolina and then in New York. Luther’s voice was one that could bring you to tears. He was singing in the chorus church and was so small, the robe dragged on the floor as he sang “Ave Maria” as a young man for 12 years. He moved to Williams Avenue in Springfield Gardens from Morning Side Avenue in Manhattan. It was there that he met Clarencia Flynn, who was 14 years old at the time and he was 12 years old. Luther had a singing group called the Dealers. Everyone at that time was into “Dowop.” You could hear it on every street corner, but Luther’s voice always stood out. Luther was always headed for Broadway, always trying to get a contract.
Luther went into the Air Force January 16, 1957. He was classified as a Metal Worker. When he was discharged he got married. He then went on to pursue his music again. In 1960 Luther put out an album. He appeared at the Rat Fink Room, the Galaxy Supper Club in Queens, New York, the Lamp Lighter and the El Carrib Country Club.
In 1963, under the singing name “Tommy Navarro,” Luther recorded “I Cried My Life Away,” with De Jac Records. This record became #18 on the “Top 100” song list nationally. He then worked with the Ruddy Williams Trio. In 1968, he joined the world famous Joe Boatner’s Ink Spots, with whom he received encore after encore whenever he sang lead. As a solo artist, he sang at the Moulin Rouge, the Show place of the Stars, August 23-24, 1968 and again November 1-2, 1968. He sang at the Flagship in Union, New Jersey as a Star with Mary Rooney and Linda Terri.
Luther sang at the Palisades Amusement Park under the Disc Jockey, Bruce Morrow of WABC. He sang at the Baby Grand in New York City on January 25, 1969 with his own trio “The Navarro Trio” and at the Velvet Room in Bellmore, New York for six weeks. In 1969, he sang at the Baby Grand in Brooklyn, New York as well as the Steer Inn.

Paul Petersen isn't the kind of artist who needs a very comprehensive retrospective collection, as in his brief career he scored one hit and only recorded a couple of albums. During his career, he recorded for Colpix Records, and Motown.
He is is an American movie actor, singer, novelist, and activist. Primarily known for his character-type roles in the 1960s and 1970s, as an adult Petersen established the organization A Minor Consideration to support child stars and other child laborers through legislation, family education, and personal intervention and counseling for those in crisis.
Petersen achieved fame in the 1960s, at an early age, by playing Donna Reed's son, Jeff Stone, on The Donna Reed Show. In the early 1980s, he also had a recurring role as a police officer on Matt Houston, and in the late 1990s, he played the author Paul Conway in the film Mommy's Day.
Petersen's fame brought recording offers and although his singing voice was limited, he had hit record singles with songs ""She Can't Find Her Keys"", ""Amy"", and ""Lollipops and Roses"", as well as ""My Dad"" that made #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also recorded during the 1960s for Motown, including the singles ""Chained"" (later a hit for Marvin Gaye) and ""A Little Bit For Sandy.""

In 1949, brothers Rudy and Bernard West joined another set of singing brothers, Ripley and Raphael Ingram, to form gospel quartet [b]The Sentimental Four[/b]. Inspired by the harmonies of The Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots, they soon began to shift toward R&B.

The young foursome toured briefly with Miller's Brown-Skinned Models, an all-black revue that played fairs and carnivals. The act started winning local talent contests and those victories led to a chance to perform at the Apollo Theatre in New York City where the group won a contest as well. Soon after, Los Angeles-based [l=Aladdin Records] signed the group. After a few lineup changes that included adding a fifth member, the combo renamed itself The Five Keys. 

""[i]Ling, Ting, Tong[/i],"" was a number 28 pop hit in 1954. That was followed by the ballad ""[i]Out of Sight, Out of Mind[/i],"" which reached number 23 in 1956 and ""[i]Wisdom of a Fool[/i]"" which hit number 35 in 1957. However, the group's influence was greater than the best-sellers would indicate.

Before black groups started crossing over onto pop charts, The Five Keys had a powerful effect on R&B music especially among vocal harmony acts. ""One of the most popular, influential and beautiful-sounding R&B singing groups of the 1950s, The Five Keys were not only a link between the gospel/pop units of the '40s and the later R&B and rock groups, they led by example, having hits in R&B, rock 'n' roll, and pop before the decade was through,"" wrote Jay Warner in the [u]Billboard Book of American Singing Groups[/u]."

An American country music singer and songwriter primarily known for his 1948 hit, ""The Deck of Cards"".

Tyler wrote and recorded ""The Deck of Cards"" in 1948. The spoken-word hit single, which was his biggest hit, tells the story of a World War II soldier who explains how a deck of playing cards serves him as a Bible, an almanac and a prayer book. He followed that smash with another recitation, the tear-wrenching Mary Jean Shurtz composition ""Dad Gave My Dog Away"". His popularity resulted in a booking at New York City's Carnegie Hall."

Louis played a crucial role in the development of rhythm and blues and is considered one of the forerunners of rock and roll. Jordan and his band were known for their upbeat, humorous songs and engaging stage presence. Jordan's music mixed swing, blues, and boogie-woogie into something frequently called jump blues. His music often included witty lyrics and a strong emphasis on rhythm, laying the groundwork for rock and roll. He popularized the use of smaller ensembles during the big band era, showcasing a sound that was accessible, danceable, and adaptable for jukeboxes. Jordan played all forms of saxophone, the clarinet and piano. His specialty was the alto sax.

He recorded numerous hits, including ""Caldonia,"" ""Choo Choo Ch'Boogie,"" ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" and ""Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens."" Many of these songs became crossover successes on both the R&B and pop charts.

Louis Jordan significantly influenced a wide range of musicians and genres.
