They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

The group was formed by art students in Liverpool in April 1977 out of an earlier band, known variously as 'Albert Dock' or 'Albert and the Cod Warriors', who had supported the Sex Pistols on one of their infamous early gigs the previous year.

The band originally consisted of Bob Bellis (drums, vocals); John (J.J.) Campbell (vocals); Martin Dempsey (bass guitar, vocals) (later replaced by first Ray ""Chopper"" Cooper, then Mick Shiner and finally Glyn Havard); Henry Priestman (vocals, keyboards); and Martin Watson (guitar, vocals).

They played their first show (as ‘Yachts’) at Eric's nightclub in Liverpool, supporting Elvis Costello. This led to a recording contract with Stiff Records, where they released one single, the witty and self-referential ""Suffice To Say"", written by Priestman and Campbell and produced by Will Birch. The band then signed to Radar Records and released two albums, a self-titled debut (released as S.O.S. in the US) and Yachts Without Radar. Following Radar's dissolution,the band released one final single (""A Fool Like You"") on Demon before splitting up in 1981. They also released a novelty single, ""Do The Chud"", as the Chuddy Nuddies."

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Initially formed as a trio called ""Genesis,"" then ""Mammoth,"" in 1972 (Eddie on guitar and lead vocals, Alex on drums, Mark Stone on bass), and renamed ""Van Halen"" by David Lee Roth (ex-Red Ball Jets), who joined the band in 1973 after Mammoth had rented a PA system from him. Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

In 2019, further reunion plans were discussed, but the band ended upon the death of Eddie Van Halen on October 6, 2020.

During its first three years, the group was a progressive rock band with a somewhat fluid membership known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia. Most of the members in this early incarnation also played on Rundgren's solo albums of the period up to 1975. By 1976, the group was known simply as Utopia and was a stable quartet of Todd Rundgren, Kasim Sulton, Roger Powell and John ""Willie"" Wilcox. This version of the group gradually abandoned prog-rock for straightforward rock and pop.

In 1980, they had a top 40 hit with ""Set Me Free"". Though often thought of as a Rundgren-oriented project, all four members of Utopia wrote, sang, produced and performed on their albums; ""Set Me Free"", for example, was sung by Sulton. The group broke up in 1986, but reunited briefly in 1992. More recently, beginning in 2011 the earlier prog-rock incarnation known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia was revived for a series of live shows.

Ex-Grunties Melvyn Crawford (gtr) and Kerry Kirk (drums) originally wanted to audition Keine Namen’s Tim Naylor as a replacement singer when original vocalist - Tim Freeman (later of Frazier Chorus) - left due to ‘musical’ differences. Various hybrids of the Grunties and Keine Namen rehearsed over a few weeks around Xmas ’78 with the lineout stabilising around Melvyn who also took on vocal duties, Kerry on drums and Tim on bass and a bit of shouting. Keine Namen drummer Dave took on the manager’s mantle. Meanwhile, The Fastnets guitarist Jon Monks took on duties engineering the band’s sound and documenting various recordings, eventually joining the band as second guitarist.  

In January 1980 Controls debut EP on Stupid Rabbit Tapes was released - ‘Sock it to ‘em Dave’. Controls unwitting pioneering approach to releasing indie cassettes of their material got the band noticed and a short mention in Sounds resulted in around 500 sales of this 4 track cassette featuring ‘So Soon I Forget’, ‘Secrets’, ‘Nobodies Daughter’ and ‘Invited Few’, as well as numerous fanzine pieces and distribution offers.  A second release on the Stupid Rabbit Tapes, the 'Don't Adjust The Controls' album came out in the summer of 1980 and sold around 100 copies.  The band played numerous gigs including the punk, mod and new wave season at the Tumbledown Dick in Farnborough, a double-header with The Mental that degenerated in what the local newspaper later declared was 'The Crondall Village Hall Riot"" and a Beatle-esque performance on the roof of the cafeteria at Aldershot Lido's fiftieth anniversary event.

Personnel changes in the summer saw a different line up gigging in the Autumn and Winter of 1980 with Jim Rump on lead vocals and Mick Pendleton on lead guitar joining the Naylor/Kirk rhythm section.  This line up released the Late Night Love Songs album and was bootlegged on the Happy Sound of Eating live release tape.  The band also played a very well attended gig at The Wooden Bridge in Guildford.

Both line-ups of Controls appeared on X-Cassettes releases in 1981 - 'Anything Could Happen in the Next Half House' (X-002), 'Bits' (X-002) and 'Dance' (a Controls compilation)."

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Born In Monroe, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, United States, in 1937, Died 9 November 1992.

Troyce Key became interested in the blues after hearing a record by Lightnin’ Hopkins, and he began playing guitar following a serious illness that resulted in hospitalization. 
During this time he was greatly influenced by the records of Fats Domino, Johnny Otis, Muddy Waters, and others. 
He was signed by Warner Brothers Records in 1958, and released three singles. 

Troyce Key teamed up with J.J. Malone in 1961, and they started recording together around three years later. 
They also released two albums with Red Lightnin’, and enjoyed a near-hit in the U.K. in 1980 with the single ""I Gotta New Car (I Was Framed)"". 

He continued until his death to present his good-natured, rocking blues in Oakland, California, at his own club called ""Eli Mile High"", which was also the name of his blues record label.

Ex-Grunties Melvyn Crawford (gtr) and Kerry Kirk (drums) originally wanted to audition Keine Namen’s Tim Naylor as a replacement singer when original vocalist - Tim Freeman (later of Frazier Chorus) - left due to ‘musical’ differences. Various hybrids of the Grunties and Keine Namen rehearsed over a few weeks around Xmas ’78 with the lineout stabilising around Melvyn who also took on vocal duties, Kerry on drums and Tim on bass and a bit of shouting. Keine Namen drummer Dave took on the manager’s mantle. Meanwhile, The Fastnets guitarist Jon Monks took on duties engineering the band’s sound and documenting various recordings, eventually joining the band as second guitarist.  

In January 1980 Controls debut EP on Stupid Rabbit Tapes was released - ‘Sock it to ‘em Dave’. Controls unwitting pioneering approach to releasing indie cassettes of their material got the band noticed and a short mention in Sounds resulted in around 500 sales of this 4 track cassette featuring ‘So Soon I Forget’, ‘Secrets’, ‘Nobodies Daughter’ and ‘Invited Few’, as well as numerous fanzine pieces and distribution offers.  A second release on the Stupid Rabbit Tapes, the 'Don't Adjust The Controls' album came out in the summer of 1980 and sold around 100 copies.  The band played numerous gigs including the punk, mod and new wave season at the Tumbledown Dick in Farnborough, a double-header with The Mental that degenerated in what the local newspaper later declared was 'The Crondall Village Hall Riot"" and a Beatle-esque performance on the roof of the cafeteria at Aldershot Lido's fiftieth anniversary event.

Personnel changes in the summer saw a different line up gigging in the Autumn and Winter of 1980 with Jim Rump on lead vocals and Mick Pendleton on lead guitar joining the Naylor/Kirk rhythm section.  This line up released the Late Night Love Songs album and was bootlegged on the Happy Sound of Eating live release tape.  The band also played a very well attended gig at The Wooden Bridge in Guildford.

Both line-ups of Controls appeared on X-Cassettes releases in 1981 - 'Anything Could Happen in the Next Half House' (X-002), 'Bits' (X-002) and 'Dance' (a Controls compilation)."

The pair broke away to form Sweetshop, later shortened to just Sweet, with Steve Norman Priest (b. 23 February 1950, Hayes, Middlesex) on bass and [a5543814] on guitar. After releasing four unsuccessful singles on Fontana and EMI, Torpey was replaced by first [a2579185], and then Mick by Andrew David Scott (b. 30 June 1949, Wrexham, Wales) and the new line-up signed to RCA. The band were introduced to the writing partnership of Chinn and Chapman, who were to provide the band with a string of hit singles.However, the band were writing their own hard-rock numbers on the b-sides of these hits. The group's determinedly effete, glam-rock image was reinforced by a succession of Top 10 hits.

The Sweet in 1974 recorded the album Sweet Fanny Adams without the assistance of Chinn and Chapman. The album charted at number 27, but disappeared again after just two weeks. As The Sweet became more of an albums band, the hit singles began to dry up. Following a move to Polydor, they cut four albums with each release making less impact than its predecessor.

Since 1982, various incarnations of the band have appeared from time to time, with up to two of the original members in any one line-up. In 1992 two versions of the band - [a=Andy Scott's Sweet] & [A=Brian Connolly Sweet] - began regularly touring and gigging. In 1997, Brian Connolly died in hospital from a muscular disorder.
