The wall of noise produced by the band encompasses very untraditional drums sound supplied in the form of distorted 909 kick drums, and industrial sound scapes with general destructive elements used to enhance sonic assault. With twin vocal attacks and machine gun vocals rhythms the band stop at nothing to express their hatred on humanity. 

The Berzerker was created as a solo studio project in 1995 and went on to release various EP's on labels such as 
Industrial Strength (USA), Speedcore (GERMANY)and Widerstand (AUSTRIA). 1998 saw the initial contact with Earache Records (UK) with the re-mixes of the Morbid Angel tracks Day of Suffering, Abominations and The Ancient Ones. 
The Berzerker was offered a contract with Earache Records for a number of full-length albums shortly afterwards, 
and in 2000 the Self-Titled album was released and the live act was born. 

The bands first film clip for the track ""Reality"" was banned by the ITC (independent television commission) and MTV due to excessive strobe lighting and horrific images, including the appearance of the band. 

In early 2001 the band headed off on a successful 27 show tour of the USA and Canada.

And in 2002/03 the band embarked on a World Tour to support their album Dissimulate this saw over 100 shows played across Australia, USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and many more. They did full month long tours with bands such as toured with such bands as Nile, Napalm Death, Strapping Young Lad, Vader, Immolation and many more...

From the official website:
------------------------------------
Darkflight started in the year 2000, creating a mix of blackened doom metal with fantasy influenced lyrics. In the beginning of 2002, the debut demo ""Obscure"" was completed, with the demo's concept inspired by Adam Nichols's fantasy book, ""The War Of The Lords Veil"". The label Totentroll (Rage of Achilles subsidiary), who specialized in releasing 7"" vinyls of fantasy metal, proposed to release two of the demo tracks as an EP single called ""Alone Somewhere Beyond"". Meanwhile, Darkflight recorded the album ""Under The Shadow Of Fear"" and attracted the attention of the main label. They both decided to focus on releasing a full length and the 7"" EP single was cancelled. The band signed a 2 album record deal, and the album was released on June 30th, 2003.

Darkflight started recordings for the next album called ""The Northern Campaign"". In the middle of 2004, Rage of Achilles announced that it would cease to exist due to financial problems. The band used some of the unfinished album tracks and released an online Promo, while searching for a new label.

A few labels contacted the band during that time and while Darkflight didn't have enough material for a second full length, they decided to join in a split album with another band. Together, Oak Knoll Productions and Konklav Records planned a split release with the French band Ars Moriendi. Unfortunately, Oak Knoll Productions couldn't handle the manufacturing costs, as well as having very serious financial problems, resulting in the canceling of the CD.

During 2007 year the band released the 3rd demo called ""Distant Pain"" and immediately caught the attention of the US based label Ars Magna Recordings. Recording sessions took place in the winter of 2007 and the second full length album named ""Perfectly Calm"" was completed, containing some new songs, the ""Distant Pain"" demo and two of the tracks from the unreleased split album. The album was released on the 6th of June 2008 and contains 8 tracks of nearly 60 minutes of playing time. Currently the band is working on a new full length album with the temporary title ""Closure"".

Jon Gomm,Hypertension,1216628,0,3642829,UK,2003,57.47,11,['Album'],"['Rock', 'Pop']",['Acoustic'],"Jon Gomm is an acoustic singer-songwriter with an incredible virtuoso guitar style, where he uses one acoustic guitar to create drum sounds, basslines and sparkling melodies all at the same time, and combining styles from blues and jazz to rock and pop. The emphasis is still on the soulful vocals and songwriting however, and his original material is influenced by everything from Robert Johnson to Radiohead.

Jon first laid his hands on a guitar at the age of two (actually it was a ukulele - his parents couldn’t find a guitar small enough). He started taking classical guitar lessons, wrote his first song at the age of six, and at twelve he was accompanying his father, a music critic, to blues gigs in his hometown of Blackpool. Touring musicians would often stay at the Gomm household on the understanding Jon would get a guitar lesson, meaning he had one-to-one instruction from such legends as Walter Trout, Bob Brozman, Sherman Robertson and Norman Beaker (Jack Bruce band).

On leaving school Jon turned down a place at Oxford University to attend The Guitar Institute in London. While there he paid his way through college playing jazz in café-bars, recording as a session guitarist, and even playing Country & Western in working mens clubs for line-dancers.

Eventually he heard the call of the north and moved to Leeds, where he is now based, to study on the Jazz degree course at the music college there. He decided to try his hand at performing solo, and discovered all kinds of new sounds he could make with an acoustic guitar – hitting the surface of it to make snare drum, bass drum and bongo sounds, re-tuning the strings to get bass sounds, and teasing high harmonics from the guitar for synthesizer-like effects. He worked all these techniques into his own songs, and put his years of singing blues into use.

Nowadays he tours Europe, playing at festivals from Rome to Athens, has a huge cult following and is regarded by those in the know as one of the world’s most talented and innovative acoustic guitarists. Even with only one CD so far released he is already cited as an influence by many other performers. His videos are watched thousands of times within days of appearing on Youtube, and his home-recorded CD “Hypertension” has sold over ten thousand copies with no industry backing.

traditional way by playing covers in rough-neck South London pubs.
As he honed his distinctive take on acoustic/indie/rock, he introduced
more of his own songs into the live sets - gradually edging out the
covers to develop a recognisable voice of his own.

Lyrically compelling, he writes not just with wit but with the
honesty of experience - Last Six Strings in particular is a
song I defy any Londoner not to recognise a piece of him
or herself in. Perhaps that is the key to why his songs
really hit home: from the simple, pared-down beauty of
Sophie to the embitteredly anthemic Green Eyes and
Losing Me; they recall emotions as universal as they are
deeply personal.

It is this same rawness of emotion which characterises Ben's live sets.
The years of hard work since those early covers gigs combined with
his passionate and engaging live performance show that although still
occasionally (and delightfully) rough around the edges, Ben clearly
has the talent and the drive to become one of London's finest ever
singer/songwriters.

Dear Everyone,

Right, I've been putting this off for ages...
writing about myself on the website, but
then I thought, well I sing about myself
enough and go on about myself constantly,
so why buck the trend? So here we go;

I was never likely to be good at this
songwriting stuff, because as a teenager
listening almost exclusively to sixties pop
and nineties rock, I didn't really want to do
anything 'new' - there was just a few great
people I wanted to be like. After playing in
pubs, bars, cafe's, at brother-in-law's
birthdays etc... I realized that I was just
doing a bad impression of a sort of
Lennon/Springstein/Gallagher/Baez morph
(don't ask). Wake-up call. Either join a
cover's band and start earning some decent
money or start writing about what I know.
Which I then realized wasn't very much. So I
started writing what I think. Which is
marginally more. 

Don't get me wrong, I think there is a something to be said for just getting on stage and
singing rock and roll songs and looking cool and getting the girls, but that's not all there is.
Actually getting up and doing something that's totally your own is something that has struck
me as being more interesting recently - which also helps you get the girls.

It's a long road, and maybe one without an end, to getting to thinking yeah that's what I
wanted to write, and it's original, but things are moving along nicely.

Having regular gigs at relaxed and intimate venues has let me mess about with stuff (new
songs old songs, friendly (sometimes not so friendly) banter) and developing the on stage
version of me in general.

The bigger gigs are starting to follow in behind one another and there is some really nice
support slots coming up, which is always useful. If you've been to a gig and like what you've
seen/heard please sign up to the mailing list and come again.

Thanks for reading - I'm off to the toilet now to be sick.

Love

Ben

The title track became the band's biggest hit, reaching no.3 in the UK in 1973, and they followed it up with Rising Sun (no. 11). For the next album Thru' A Five, the duo were augmented on a regular basis by [a287213] of Family on drums, [a287216] on guitar, and [a426498] on bass. The album featured the Slim Harpo-influenced song Slip and Slide which became the band's final hit, reaching no.22 in the UK in 1974. Despite consistent touring, often as a supporting act, Medicine Head failed to place an album on the UK Albums Chart. For their final album Two Man Band, recorded at Pete Townshend's Eel Pie Studios, they reverted to being a duo.

Medicine Head finally folded in 1977. In 2005, Angel Air released the album Don't Stop The Dance, a 'lost' album, compiling some singles from an unsuccessful period with [l33191] and some unreleased sessions of the band as a five piece. John Fiddler released solo albums after the breakup of the band but revived the Medicine Head name for Fiddlersophical in 2011. In 2020 Cherry Red released a 50th Anniversary edition of the New Bottles Old Medicine debut with a second disc of singles, sessions & live material spanning the 1970-1975 period."

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

The band also features Gavin Sharp (sax and keys) and John Hart (Guitar and trombone) both formerly of the classic Edward II line, and the heart and soul of the band. Together they have developed their roots sound bound by strong melody, sweet harmony, bubbling guitar and blistering brass hooks. After Edward II split up in November 1999, Alton Zebby (Edward II's drummer) emigrated to Ethiopia as part of the pre-millenium Rastafarian exodus. Glen also went to Africa but returned to The UK inspired and with a renewed desire to perform. After initial rehersals T & Latouche were born…… The debut album 'Tales from an urban safari' has a reggae sound shot through with flavours of other musical generes, notably Afrobeat, Arabic, Calypso and Ska. Imagine yourself walking down Claremont Road in Moss Side or Brixton and overhearing conversations whilst music drifts past. Songs feature tales of underground parties, political frustrations, drug busts, love, hope and frustration…"

Far from being a Class of 2000 alt.pop supergroup (Fierce Panda contingent), Skandinavia are actually embracers of Rawk Music and duly have the riffery to prove it. New single 'Never Too Late' comes on like a slab of early ‘90s power metal, with layered wailing vocals, soaring violin and thumping bass, but without the ‘ironic’ factor that could have them labelled as a typical ‘post-Darkness’ band (even though Dan Hawkins once played guitar for them). Meanwhile B-side 'Storm' is reminiscent of 'Pablo Honey'-era Radiohead given more oomph, dusted with string accompaniment and replacing Thom for PJ Harvey. Plus the lyrical content is said to concern Nordic mythology, which is a far cry from singing about Star Wars fanatics and wetting yourself in front of potential boyfriends. Stormy, mystical and highly enjoyable Iceland rock it is, then.

The Handsome Beasts,04,1190249,0,8310914,UK,2004,47.93,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"The Handsome Beasts is a heavy metal band from Nuneaton, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, that was formed in 1972. The band was part of the NWOBHM movement.

Fronted by singer Garry Dalloway (nick-named ""the original fat bastard"" by the Kerrang! Direktory Of Heavy Metal), they quickly became local heroes. 

Paul Birch, who rated the band very highly, tried to get them a record deal asking numerous major labels if they would be interested. They weren't, so he founded his own label, [l=Heavy Metal Records], to release the first Handsome Beasts EP, ""All Riot Now"" in 1980. 

In 1981 ""Breaker"" EP was released again by [l=Heavy Metal Records]. In this EP the 'digital spiral technique' was used, it played ""Crazy"" or ""One In A Crowd"" depending on where you put the record needle at the beginning, a gimmick later used by [a=Kiss]. A little later, ""Sweeties"" EP was also released by [l=Heavy Metal Records].

Dalloway, bassist Steve Hough, guitarist Phil Aston and drummer Pete Malbasa played further gigs in the midlands area before recording their debut LP ""Beastiality"" in 1981 and in the same time Aston was replaced by Paul Robins. With an outrageous but humorous cover, the album showed that musically Handsome Beasts still incorporated massive blues influences into their heavy metal sound. The album featured only four new songs, ""David's Song"", ""Another Day"", ""Tearing Me Apart"" and ""High Speed"" as the rest of the material was previously released in their EP's. 

When in the middle of the 80's, N.W.O.B.H.M. started to fade-out, it was time for Handsome Beasts to call it quits.

However in 1990 Garry reformed the band with guitarist Maz Matrenko, Ray Richman on drums and they released ""The Beasts Within"" album. Another album was recorded during the 90’s entitled ""Little Sister"" but was never released.

In 2004 the band released the ""04"" album with a new line-up of Garry (vocals), Ray Richman (drums), Alan Nyland (guitar), Mark Boreland (guitar) and Sean Brennan (bass).

In 2005 Ray Richman left and was replaced on drums by Mick Roobottom.

Unfortunately Garry passed away in August 2005 due to a heart attack, only shortly after recording another album. There were thoughts by the rest of the members about the band's future, but they remembered Garry saying 18 months earlier and while watching the front-man Simon Hall of Beholder, a local covers band: 'when I peg it, that's the guy you want'. 

Shortly after Garry's death, the band indeed asked Simon if he would like to sing in some gigs in the memory of Garry. These gigs went quite well and the band decided that Garry was right after all, Simon was the right guy and so they asked him to join the band permanently. 

Garry's last album was finally released in June 2007, entitled ""Rock And A Hard Place"".

Simon left the band in late 2007 and was shortly followed by Si Fielding (a bass player from Beholder who joined Handsome Beasts in the summer of 2007).

In December 2007 the band found a new front-man, Rocky Shades. He was the singer from the legendary [a=Wrathchild], a band with whom Handsome Beasts were mates back in the [l=Heavy Metal Records] days. Besides the new vocalist, a new bass player joined, Shawn Till, a friend of Mick's who for the last couple of years had been fronting a [a=Motörhead] tribute band called Motörkill.

Currently Handsome Beasts are still active, playing some gigs and preparing material for a new LP, however no original member is left in their ranks.

""As Intrigue, we have been developing our musical style for 40 years (and via some name changes along the way) from a pop-folk-rock combination in the mid-1970s, through a moderately successful new wave period in the 1980s (as Crowd Control), to the current sound, which is best described as indie-prog. The music is strong on songs and melody, but with plenty of space for experimentation and instrumentals. The foundation of our music is a Christian worldview, with a tendency to write at a tangent to the usual gospel approach and lyrics""."

As the daughter of [a=Maddy Prior] and [a=Rick Kemp] from [a=Steeleye Span] (with whom she sang live while still a teenager), it is perhaps not surprising that Rose Kemp's early material (the Glance album) is largely acoustic folk. However, from that point on, she began to move into a more heavily guitar-orientated direction and it is perhaps significant that Glance is the only one of her albums that Kemp does not acknowledge on her website.

Mini-Album and A Hand Full Of Hurricanes can probably best be characterised as hard-edged indie-folk rock but Unholy Majesty and Golden Shroud have moved decisively into metal-edged doom rock, with Rose Kemp's image similarly moving."

Longer ago than they care to remember (1992-Ed), there was a band called Quiet Melon. Taking their name from the infamous Small Faces/Artwoods hybrid, they played raw 60's influenced garage and R'n'B. Sort of Prisoners/Creeps but without the keyboards!

Band members were :-
Rob Dady - Rhythm guitar
Lee Armitage - Vocals
Nigel Gwennap - Lead Guitar
Paul Doody - Bass
Hoppy - Drums

After blagging support slots with Glen Matlock (ex Sex Pistols), The Selecter and Doctor & the Medics, they were soon headlining themselves, and built up a loyal following. Like all line-ups though, it couldn't last. And anyway, The band couldn't keep up with Hoppy's drumming! Time for a change, and in came Kieron Battles on drums. A name change (for one gig only they were called Decembers Children) and couple of demo's were released, and despite lots of interest from the majors (Chrysalis records take note), the band never managed to sign the exclusive deal they'd hoped for. Paul left to pursue other projects, and Kieron went on to join Cinnamon Smith. Nigel, being Nigel, went off (he has a tendency to let his mind wander) and continued doing his thing with Black Cat. So in came Lee Harris (ex Tree House/The Cynics) on Bass, Matty Bane (ex Hip Tracies) on drums, and Steve Paul on Lead Guitar.

But something wasn't working. Lee Harris was really a frustrated guitarist so left to do his own thing. Rob switched to Bass (a smart move), which left a space for another guitarist, and in came Steve (Jock) Hendry. Now they were Roundabout!! This line up carried on quite successfully for a year or so, but there was trouble brewing in the ranks!! Lee Harris (the old bass player) was in the throws of forming a new band, Carnival, and the best singer he'd seen was already in a band, Roundabout infact. This was very flattering to singer Lee, and as he was already thinking it was time for a change, agreed to join him. Lee then sang in both of these bands for 6 months, but Rob was not best pleased, and Lee was subsequently sacked! The 2 of them not parting amicably, which was a great shame as they'd been mates for years.

Still.....on with the story. Steve Paul had new work commitment and so had to leave, which left just Rob, Matt and Jock. They needed a new singer and guitarist. They found and asked Nigel who as well as playing guitar now took on the keyboards, so he was back. Just a new singer required. Who could they find? Up step Andy Gibbons (ex Reverberation) who quickly learnt the songs and the show went on. Rob continued writing songs (on his own since Lee had left) and into the studio they went. Out they came with the album ""It's nice to be nice"" - a selection of old and new songs, Released by Arc Records. Incidentally, you'll notice that there's no songwriting credit for Lee Armitage as he and Rob still weren't talking, even though he was partially responsible for some of the songs. The album received much acclaim, but the touring was taking its toll. The boys like a drink at the best of times don't you know, amongst other things!! So they split. Simple as that. What once was great came to an end. Quite abruptly. Back to their day jobs. Back to the Hell of their day jobs!! A year went by. Jock wasn't happy. Rob wasn't happy. Lee (now ex Carnival/Nixon) wasn't happy. ""Lets get the old band back together"", cried Jock. ""Oh, go on then"", was the reply. Rob and Lee made up, Steve Paul came back on guitar, but Matty bane was now firmly ensconced in The More Specials. They needed a drummer, and up stepped Joe Tatley (ex Inflatable Sharks).

The line up was now
Rob Dady - Bass guitar
Lee Armitage - Vocals
Jock Hendry - Rhythm Guitar
Steve Paul - Lead Guitar
Joe Tatley - Drums

They rehearsed a batch of songs that came together so quickly it was unbelievable, and within a matter of weeks were back out gigging again. How they had missed it, and judging by crowd reactions, how they'd been missed!! They carried on for 6 months, but Steve Paul wasn't enjoying the live work (if he was honest, he preferred the studio anyway), so Ben (Phil O’pino) Watts was drafted in as his replacement. During all this, Lee had had a little boy, Oscar, and Jocks girlfriend was pregnant (with Jessica). Jock decided to leave, so Ben took over lead guitar. Erin Bardwell (ex Skanksters/Unity/The More Specials) was also drafted in on keyboards. Then Jock decided he didn't really want to go. So he stayed.

Now there were six!!
Rob Dady - Bass guitar
Lee Armitage - Vocals
Jock Hendry - Lead Guitar
Ben Watts - Rhythm Guitar
Erin Bardwell - keyboards
Joe Tatley - Drums

Into the studio again to record the EP ""Maximum Power Pop"". Maximum as a nod to The Who. Power Pop as the only way they could now describe the volume/intensity of their new live shows. Lee was a Mod after all!! October 2002 saw the departure of Joe and Jock to join Nova, a local covers band. It was a shame, but meant that original band members Matty Bane and Steve Paul could rejoin. This was the first time this original line up had played together in quite a few years, and the gigs rocked. Anyone who saw their version of Tin Soldier that night in December at Riffs would testify. Erin then left after the Christmas 2002 show to concentrate on his solo album, and Matty went with him. How could he refuse? They were recording in Jamaica after all!! So in came Steve Rose (ex Steerpyke) on drums. The next few months were filled with lots of recording and a few gigs (not enough), and then a break in the summer as Steve Roses’ wife Charlotte gave birth to their twins, Isaac and Esmé. A brother and sister for Maisie. During this break period, Ben decided to go his own way, and left to form a band with ex Roundabout singer Andy Gibbons and ex Carnival guitarist Lee Harris, the latter now playing drums. The Quezon City Rocket Corps. were then born! So, in came new boy Sam Drew on keyboards.

The line up was now:-
Rob Dady - Bass guitar, b. vox
Lee Armitage – Vocals, harmonica, guitar, tambourine, maraccas
Steve Paul - Lead Guitar, b.vox
Sam Drew - keyboards
Steve Rose - Drums

Incidentally, Matty Bain has now joined legendary Ska outfit Bad Manners. Dec 2003 saw the departure of Sam Drew, to be replaced by Dean Sweeney on guitar. Dean was a friend of Lee and Robs from years ago. In fact Lee was nearly the singer in Deans band The Rhythm Method back in 1985, but unfortunately it never came off as the drummer left to join the Army. But that's another story. Incidentally the bass player in that band was local Face Dean Belcher. He's now a famous photographer.

The current line up is now:-
Rob Dady - Bass guitar, b. vox
Lee Armitage – Vocals, harmonica, guitar, tambourine, maraccas
Steve Paul - Lead Guitar, b.vox
Dean Sweeney - Guitar
Steve Rose - Drums, b. vox

This founding line-up evolved out of previous combos with fluid memberships such as To Suckle The Pups and BackDrumMower.
The INECTO SCHOOL's instrumentation of double bass, trumpet/flugelhorn, drumkit, voice, guitar and percussion resembled that of a jazz band and their method was totally improvised but their music did not fall easily into any single musical category.
They recorded their music extensively in private sessions and performed live at concerts in Leeds and Glasgow through 2003-04, supporting artists such as Jack Rose, Frog Pocket, The One Ensemble of Daniel Padden and McWatt.  Recordings of these INECTO SCHOOL concerts were issued as 'The Together Road Tapes' (2CDR set) in 2005.
INECTO SCHOOL produced several self-released albums in small runs on CDR, with handmade covers, beginning with St. Vitus' Dance (2004); Wrangthorn (2004) and Night Works (2010). The band assembled their albums as 'scrapbooks' made up of edited extracts from longer improvised recordings. Sessions taped in 2003-04 provided the source material for all the group's album releases up to 2010.  These albums were co-produced/mastered variously by Daniel Padden, Matthew Robson and Alan Jenkins.
In September 2004 the original line-up ceased playing together with the relocation of two members abroad. 
In 2022 THE INECTO SCHOOL published a re-issue box set of its first three albums (supplemented by selected concert recordings) as RITUAL STILLS in an edition of 100, including facsimiles of original artwork and an illustrated booklet."

In February 1977, Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious (John Ritchie aka John Beverley, b. May 10, 1957). The band effectively split up after their 1978 US tour, although Jones and Cook continued to record under the name for another year or so.

The original line-up reformed in 1996 for a series of concert tours, and has played live shows off and on since then, and released live recordings.

He has several productive and successful live-performing alliances, all ongoing, including with long-time collaborator Ian Blake, with Armenian duduk player Tigran Aleksanyan, and with Canada-based Chinese pipa and gu-cheng virtuoso Liu Fang and Vietnamese dan bau master Pham Duc Thanh.

He and the musicians on his 9th solo album, ""The Unbroken Surface of Snow"" (Cloud Valley, 2011) – Armenian duduk master Tigran Aleksanyan, multi-instrumentalist Ian Blake and Finnish singer Sanna Kurki-Suonio – became the band SANS, releasing ""SANS LIve"" in 2014, and, with the line-up expanded by the addition of Sanna's daughter Erika Hammarberg as co-vocalist, in 2018 released the album ""Kulku"" (Cloud Valley, 2018).

His 10th solo album, ""Zithers"" (Cloud Valley, 2020) is entirely solo, featuring just two instruments, both of them – as the title suggests – zithers: the electrified 74-string chord zither that has been a key instrument for him throughout his career, and a more recent one of his own devising, the marovantele, which has 22 pairs of strings on each side. 

As a world music journalist Andrew Cronshaw writes features and reviews, particularly for fRoots magazine but also including the Nordic, Baltic and Portuguese chapters in The Rough Guide to World Music, etc.
Apart from his own albums, he has produced, and often engineered, albums by June Tabor, Silly Sisters, Bill Caddick, Zumzeaux, Brendan Power, Salamakannel, Nikolai Blad and others, and produced the mixes of Flook's Flatfish and of Hannu Saha's Mahla.
Session work includes playing on albums by Hue & Cry, Scott Walker, Suede, Natacha Atlas, Martin Simpson, Pascal Gaigne, B.J.Cole and Ute Lemper, on film soundtracks including Outlaw King, Tolkien, GI Jane, and others. The song 'Zitherbell', which he co-wrote and performs with Natacha Atlas on her album 'Foretold in the Language of Dreams', appears in Jonathan Demme's film 'The Truth About Charlie'.

Egypt's original line-up first got together in a squat in Shepherds Bush, London in late 1987, but the story really begins a few weeks before when ex-Groundhogs bass player Alan Fish and ex-Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker were asked to record the very first album release (literally serial number 001) for the then fledgling record label HTD Records (HTD are now Talking Elephant Records and deal with Wishbone Ash, Fairport Convention, Ritchie Blackmore, Steven Stills, etc.). Also included was guitarist Don Greer (ex-Bachman Turner Overdrive and others).

This initial plan got as far as some recording sessions (unreleased) before Clive found himself unavailable due to other commitments and Don decided to move back home to the States and was unable to continue, though he would later fill in for a broken-thumbed Eric Chipulina whilst Egypt were in the US for a short while in the early 1990s. Alan was determined to carry on but was now on his own with recording and gig commitments to fulfil. Having difficulty finding the right musicians he began looking for a suitable ready-made band instead and met the first Egypt drummer Peter Chichon at one of these auditions. Peter was also there to audition but opted to pitch in with Alan instead.

Alan Fish started off his musical career (as guitarist initially) playing skiffle at the age of 12. As a teenager during the 1960s he had been in bands in the far east supporting The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks and other names of the era before relocating in the UK where he was again, during the 1960s/70s, supporting many name acts including David Bowie. He had recently left his bass playing job with bike rally favourites Dumpys Rusty Nuts and had played since the mid-seventies with the legendary Tony T S McPhee in The Groundhogs, Terraplane, and Tony McPhee's Turbo, recording several albums. In the 1980s he joined Tredegar (with ex-Budgie drummer & guitarist Ray Philips and Tony Bourge) and was involved in many other projects including a European tour with Chuck Berry and a couple of albums with ex-Bo Diddley harp player Billy Boy Arnold. His entire CV is too long to include here.

Peter Chichon had recently been drumming for infamous London trash/glam rockers The Gunslingers and had already played in several bands with guitarist Eric Chipulina, who joined up after playing the Benny Hill theme tune (!) at an impromptu audition at the aforementioned Shepherds Bush squat. Eric had until that time been gigging around London with Periphery (with Bill Kruse and Francis Pecino). Finally, on vocals came in Ryka who had previously been in Shattered with Peter. This line-up barely stuck together long enough to record the first album (produced by NWOBHM pioneer Paul Samson) in 1988 and do a couple of brief UK tours of mostly smaller hall and club venues.

The music at this point was very different from the blues rock style that developed later on. There was a recording and gigging schedule to keep within weeks of forming which saw some studio work begin even before a singer had been found. Material for both studio and live performances was hurriedly written and sourced from different genres, past projects, etc. and the result was a mixture of thrash metal and older metal styles along with several other things including North African and Andalusian influences, hence the name Egypt. It was suggested by the record company HTD (now Talking Elephant Records) after hearing Find A Way, a track with a somewhat Egyptian sounding riff which featured on the first album. With HTD literally waiting for a name to put on the cover so they could go ahead with artwork and release (and with the pub about to open any minute) the name was adopted despite doubts about it as no one could think of anything else in the time available.

The first album was released in 1988 getting plenty of airplay on national radio (Radio One Rock Show, featured album on Radio Caroline, etc.), an airing on a late night 'jukebox jury' type TV show on Channel 4 and press coverage nationwide. However there was a problem with distribution (by EMI subsidiary Supertrack) and by the time the album reached the shops the moment had gone. After so much money and effort had been spent and with HTD nearly sunk almost before it had even started, and therefore unable to carry on the momentum, there seemed to be nowhere to go and the band gradually began to fall apart. The first to leave was Ryka, who went on to record a solo album project with songwriting duo Nick Jefferson and Alistar Nicholson in a project called Sine on Minority One Records. Next to leave was Peter Chichon, who later found cult success in the UK and worldwide with the excellent Breed 77. Ironically a badly edited bootleg of the album made an appearance soon after and was apparently selling well.

The Wilderness Years[edit]

The first year or so immediately following the split is a blur of drummers and vocalists, many of them musician friends from the past helping to keep things going. For a while on rhythm/2nd guitar was sound engineer/road manager Dick Wilson who has been involved with Egypt from day one. Alan and Eric took over on vocal duties and played blues and rock'n'roll numbers, many of which Alan knew from his days with Chuck Berry. Despite the lack of any backing and general apathy from record companies, agencies, etc., the band managed to keep on gigging, sometimes under different names, while deciding whether to continue using the name Egypt as the style was changing so much from what it started out as. In time Eric took over more on vocals, becoming the main vocalist. This was the beginning of the transition to the current version of Egypt, in that the circumstances forced a re-invention as a more back-to-the-roots blues/rock three piece, which gradually evolved to include a more progressive blues side and a delta blues side alongside the rockers.

The 'Hogs Years-pt I[edit]

One thing that very much re-enforced this direction was joining (or in Alan's case re-joining) legendary progressive blues outfit The Groundhogs circa 1989 when Tony McPhee needed a backing band for a gig in Liverpool and asked his old bass player Alan if he could 'borrow' his band. Eventually Egypt members were to form part of various versions of the 'Hogs for the next ten years or so. By this time there had finally been found a regular drummer in Chris Bennett (previously with original Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di'Anno). All three went into The Groundhogs and continued gigging as Egypt as well (including a few weeks gigs and TV appearance in Dubai) until some time in 1991 when Chris left. More drumming friends again helped to keep Egypt going until the summer of that year.

The Present Line-up[edit]

In mid-1991 Peter Correa who had already played in bands with Eric in the dim and distant past decided to uproot from his (and Eric's) native Gibraltar and take the plunge with Egypt. This is probably where the band in its current form started, recording Preserving The Dead in 1994 for a now fast recovering but much slimmed down HTD Records. This is the CD that most of the original stuff played live over the next few years came from and the first to be representative of the current bluesier style.

The 'Hogs Years-pt II[edit]

It would have been around 1992 or 1993 that all three, one by one, joined/rejoined The Groundhogs, now and then gigging in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, apart from the regular UK circuit. They can be heard backing Tony McPhee on the Groundhogs album Lost Tapes II, recorded live in Milan in June 1994 although it was not released until several years later. Again both bands were on the go at the same time and several occasions saw Egypt doing an opening set at a Groundhogs gig.

The 'Hogs Years-pt III[edit]

Around 1996 Alan left The Groundhogs and Eric switched over to bass (initially for a couple of German gigs but in fact for about 3 years) recording the CD Hogs In Wolf's Clothing and a video Live from The Astoria London both in 1998,and another CD The Muddy Waters Songbook in 1999. Towards the end of 1999 Eric and Peter left The Groundhogs to concentrate more on Egypt, which had been pushed aside to a certain extent.

Y2K[edit]

With the decision made to focus efforts on Egypt again, things slowly but steadily began to progress over the next few years. In early 2003 Alan went to Spain for a few months to work with ex-Uriah Heep keyboard player Ken Hensley and ex-members of Wings and AC/DC. Soon after this a long overdue new CD Midnight Sun was recorded at Purple Studios in Norwich and released mid-2004 on Blues Matters Records.

The Present[edit]

From the very beginning, more than 20 years ago, Egypt has built up a reputation as a hard working live band and have rarely stopped gigging for more than a couple of weeks at a time since then. Gigs are constantly being booked throughout the UK and abroad with regular gigs in Spain, Germany and elsewhere. Also the re-release of the second and third albums (Preserving the Dead and Midnight Sun) and the recording and release of the next (and fourth) album Bluesbelly, all on Stable Records.

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

This could then be manipulated by moving magnets around the receiver in the radio. In fact the oblique band moniker soon became the identity of just one man, [a=Michael Anthony Keane], whose chequered history is a complicated tale of perseverance in the face of adversity. After sending a tape with sound frequencies and rap, they were signed by [l=Factory].

1979 RFATP were joined by [a=Nathan McGough] (bass) and [a=Phil Hurst] (drums), and Mike Keane took over vocals, guitar and keyboards. Played at the Moonlight Club in London supporting Joy Division.
By 1980 Phil Hurst left to join Hollycaust and was replaced by [a=Donald Johnson].

The end of 1981 and into the following year saw the Royal Family revert back to the original duo, playing their final gig at Plato's Ballroom (which Arthur & Nathan had set up as a venue). Arthur then moved to Newcastle and Mike got involved in solo projects and also formed Legend Agency & the Project

1984 Mike Keen is resurrecting the Royal Family with himself, [a=John Neesham] on violin, [a=Peter Hook] on drums, vocals, keyboards, [a=Lita Hira] on keyboards, and [a=Chris Jones] (vocals). Mike Keane is touring the UK at this point with [a=Stockholm Monsters].

In 1985, The Royal Family & The Poor left Factory Records and Mike Keane formed his own record label, Gaia Communications World Network. They quickly released one LP and a 12"" single, as well as recording an entire collection of new material before the distribution company Red Rhino collapsed, effectively wiping-out the label over night.
1984/85 also sees another complete new line-up: Mike Keane (vocals, keyboards, guitar, percussion), [a=Karen Halewood] (keyboards), [a=John Walsh (2)] (bass, guitar), [a=Ambrose Reynolds] (bass, percussion), [a=Jeff Turner (3)] (saxophone, guitar, violin), [a=Kif Cole] (percussion). This line up toured with New Order.

1986 saw Jeff, Karen and Kif depart and to be replaced by Paula Simms (vocals), [a=John Metcalfe] (violin) and Judith Laity (cello). Touring Holland.

In 1987 RFATP recruites [a=Simon Crab] (vocals, keyboards), [a=Merlin Shepherd] (saxophone), [a=Andy Frizell] (bass). Band toured Germany & Belgium.
Pete Fuck (aka Pic Meter, Peter Jones, Cosmic) played keyboards in 1987 (then aged 19), but didn’t do any gigs.

In 1995 ""Gaia Communications World Network"" is re-launched, releasing the third audio release by Gaia Records, recorded during 1989-1990, a CD LP release titled, ""Songs For The Children Of Baphomet: A Musickal Celebration on the Theme of Magick and A Tribute to The Life & Works Of Aleister Crowley, (1875 - 1947)"".

In 2004 another release followed: ""North West Soul"" on The Boutique Label. In 2010 Arthur McDonald self-released a new album titled ""The Pope's Daughter"" under the RFATP moniker, though this project did not involve Mike Keane."

Motörhead,3 Classic Albums,233658,0,11943407,UK,2004,152.53,51,['Compilation'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister (1945–2015), professionally known by his stage name Lemmy, who had remained the sole constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

They released a self-funded 7"" of [m=304539] mere weeks after [a=David Bowie] had released his original. This scam got them a publishing deal with Bowie's publishers and a proper record deal.  

By 1980 they were touring with [a=The Cure] and signed to [l=Fiction Records], for whom they recorded [m=72502]. At the turn of the year they relocated to [l=Situation Two] and put out a string of singles, later compiled on the album [m=72538], recorded using money from major labels who were expecting demos to be produced with their cash. In tandem with their increasing consumption of cocaine and speed, the group's music became increasingly deranged and experimental. [a=John Murphy] and [a284809] (ex-The Cure) became official members. 

The Associates signed with WEA in 1982. [a=Martha Ladly] joined as back-up singer. Billy and Alan immediately scored a string of UK top 20 chart hits. The album [m=72576] made the UK top 10, winning album of the year awards in the UK music press. The group’s drug use was at a peak - Billy and Alan’s behaviour was becoming somewhat erratic. On the eve of their biggest ever UK tour MacKenzie pulled out. A US deal with Island was consequentially lost. Deciding that he couldn't continue, Alan Rankine left the group. From this moment on, the Associates were to be just that: Billy MacKenzie solo, with different associates for each release.

MacKenzie started recording a follow-up album. 1984s [m=72626] cost WEA £250,000. It took three years and four production teams to record - twice (dissatisfied with the original production Billy ""lost"" the first versions' master tapes, forcing a re-recording). The album had some chart success, but WEA were dissatisfied, and started pressuring MacKenzie to follow a more straightforward pop-soul direction. Frustrated by WEA's lack of support, MacKenzie focussed on collaborations, most notably with [a=Yello] (featuring on One Second, Flag, Baby and writing The Rhythm Divine). 

1988's comeback single, a cover of Blondie's [m=72630], failed to chart. WEA refused to release its parent album, The Glamour Chase, and with MacKenzie over a million pounds in debt to the label The Associates were dropped. 

Circa quickly signed MacKenzie and in 1990 released Wild And Lonely, the last album of original music under the The Associates name. 1992's album, the [a=Thomas Fehlmann] / [a=Boris Blank]-produced Outernational was issued under the artist name [a=Billy MacKenzie]. Even though the album had good reviews in the press and Baby was single of the week in Melody Maker, the album stiffed - partially due to Circa winding down operations. 

Aside from an aborted Associates reunion with Alan Rankine in the mid-90s, MacKenzie remained a solo artist, collaborating in the 90s with [a=Peach], [a=Barry Adamson], [a=Paul Haig] and [a=Apollo Four Forty] amongst others. At the end of 1996, after four years without a deal, he signed with Nude Records.

Tragically his first release for the label was a posthumous one. The death of his mother in 1996 was likely the trigger of an emotional breakdown that led him deeper and deeper into a depressed state. Billy MacKenzie died aged 39, on 22nd January 1997 from an overdose of prescribed and over-the-counter pills.

Alan Rankine passed away from natural causes at the age of 64 on the 2nd of January 2023.

Cernik served in the United States Navy for two years in World War II, then sang with Carmen Cavallaro's big band. In 1947 he recorded for Decca with Cavallaro's band, but left due to food poisoning. He went next to New York City and made records for King Records as Al Grant (one, ""Cabaret"", appeared in the Variety charts). He won on the radio show Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1949 as a soloist.

Mitch Miller at Columbia records signed him in 1950 and urged him to change his name. Miller originally had intended to record a sentimental ballad called ""My Heart Cries for You"" and ""The Roving Kind"" with Frank Sinatra, however, Sinatra was not interested and rejected the songs. Mitchell recorded them and ""My Heart Cries for You"" became Mitchell's first hit song, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts. He continued with hits including ""Heartaches by the Number"" (#1 US), ""Rock-a-Billy"" (a crossover into the rock and roll field), ""The Same Old Me"" and the gigantic ""Singing the Blues"", which was number one for 10 weeks in 1956. He toured the world and had hits globally, especially in the UK and Australia. He placed nine songs in the US Top 10, 20 songs into the UK Top 10 (including 8 number ones) and 19 songs in the Australian Top 10 (including 3 number ones).

In the 1950s and 1960s Mitchell acted in such movies as Those Redheads From Seattle (1953) and Red Garters (1954), on television and hosted his own television show in 1957.

Mitchell's popularity waned in the 1960s, although he continued to record songs for a number of labels. In 1990, he appeared in several episodes of the BBC drama series Your Cheatin' Heart as the fictional country singer Jim Bob O'May, singing several standards including his own hit ""Singing the Blues"".

Mitchell died on July 1, 1999, aged 72, at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada of complications from cancer surgery.

His song ""Heartaches by the Number"" was part of the soundtrack of the 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas.

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.
 
Genesis P-Orridge died after a long battle with leukaemia on 14th March 2020."

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

The couple played together as a duo throughout the 70’s and 80’s and with countless classic line ups – Albion Country Band, Steeleye Span, Richard Thompson, Brass Monkey to name but a few.
In the hills of Shropshire, Benji, like other children immersed in the folk world, was brought up listening to a wide range of musical styles. It wasn’t long before he was picking up instruments and with the arrival of an electric guitar into his life, Benji began listening to 50’s Rock n’ Roll, before moving via ZZ Top to Jimi Hendrix.  
At college, Benji formed a band called The Hedgerows, who eventually evolved into an acoustic outfit, resulting in them having a song (penned by Benji) featured on Evolving Tradition 1 (Mrs Casey Records) in 1995. This got Benji’s name noticed and his solo debut (‘Dance in the Shadow’) was released in 1998 on the Wildgoose label. Benji joined the band Dr Faustus in the same year. 
In 2004, Benji’s 2nd solo album, ‘Half a Fruit Pie’, was released, this time on the Fellside label.
In the same year, Folk/funk/jazz/soul big band, Bellowhead was formed and Benji was a founder member. With an appearance on BBC TV’s ‘Later’ and performances everywhere from the Royal Opera House to the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, the band has gone from strength to strength. They are headlining festivals in the UK and in Europe and, following in St Etienne’s footsteps, have recently been named as Band in Residence at London’s South Bank Centre for 2008."

The band was formed in Colchester in December 1989 as [a=Seymour] but was renamed Blur in March 1990, after they'd signed for the Food label. Blur's early releases (the Leisure album and the singles off it) were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of ""baggy"" bands from the Madchester scene and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, at times reminding of Syd Barrett. Tthis was more readily apparent on several single B-sides where the group let loose a darker side.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music (e.g. The Kinks or XTC) or even nostalgic music from World War II. Their 2nd album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) had moderate success but began attracting attention for its Britishness but in hindsight it rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, with groups like [a=Suede] early frontrunners too. In 1994 Blur released what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album: Parklife. 1995's The Great Escape was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. 

When the 5th studio album Blur came out in 1997, the group had reinvented their sound. They severed ties from Britpop and reincorporated the art rock experimentalism of their early years, only this time the music was informed by a broader range of influences (e.g. Pavement). The album's second song Song 2 was released as a single and became a hit on alternative dancefloors. Subsequent albums 13 and Think Tank further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe.

After 13 and the subsequent tours, the band took a pause and its members pursued personal projects. In 1998 Albarn started the [a6378] project, Alex James engaged in [a120885] with Damien Hirst, and Graham Coxon released his first solo album the same year. Over the years Coxon had started struggling with alcoholism and when Blur started the recording sessions for Think Tank, it came to a point where they asked him to no longer be present. After its release in 2003 the band went on full hiatus until December 2008, when it was announced the band would reunite for concerts in London's Hyde Park (released as All The People) followed by a series of major concerts e.g. at Glastonbury 2009. The next year saw the release of a a documentary about the band ([url=https://www.discogs.com/master/898685-Blur-No-Distance-Left-To-Run]No Distance Left To Run[/url]) and of the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/241338-Blur-Fools-Day]Fool's Day[/url] single for RSD 2010.

In July 2012 a career spanning box set was released titled [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/460605-Blur-Blur-21-The-Box]Blur 21[/url], and in August 2012 the band headlined a show in Hyde Park for the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics (released as [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/500654-Blur-Parklive]Parklive[/url]). Earlier that year the band had tried to record a studio album with [a2728] as producer but that was aborted. In Autumn 2012 the band again paused its activities.

Early 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album: The Magic Whip. It had been created in 5 days in Hong Kong after a Japan tour that was cancelled in 2013. Following the Magic Whip tour the band went into hiatus again ... resurfacing in 2023 with their 9th studio album The Ballad Of Darren and a series of concerts. In April 2024 Albarn stated that their performance at Coachella was probably the band’s “last gig”. On 19 July 2024 a second documentary titled To The End opened in UK and Irish cinemas, as directed by Toby L.

This founding line-up evolved out of previous combos with fluid memberships such as To Suckle The Pups and BackDrumMower.
The INECTO SCHOOL's instrumentation of double bass, trumpet/flugelhorn, drumkit, voice, guitar and percussion resembled that of a jazz band and their method was totally improvised but their music did not fall easily into any single musical category.
They recorded their music extensively in private sessions and performed live at concerts in Leeds and Glasgow through 2003-04, supporting artists such as Jack Rose, Frog Pocket, The One Ensemble of Daniel Padden and McWatt.  Recordings of these INECTO SCHOOL concerts were issued as 'The Together Road Tapes' (2CDR set) in 2005.
INECTO SCHOOL produced several self-released albums in small runs on CDR, with handmade covers, beginning with St. Vitus' Dance (2004); Wrangthorn (2004) and Night Works (2010). The band assembled their albums as 'scrapbooks' made up of edited extracts from longer improvised recordings. Sessions taped in 2003-04 provided the source material for all the group's album releases up to 2010.  These albums were co-produced/mastered variously by Daniel Padden, Matthew Robson and Alan Jenkins.
In September 2004 the original line-up ceased playing together with the relocation of two members abroad. 
In 2022 THE INECTO SCHOOL published a re-issue box set of its first three albums (supplemented by selected concert recordings) as RITUAL STILLS in an edition of 100, including facsimiles of original artwork and an illustrated booklet."

Brothers Hugh (vocals, rhythm) and Norm (drums) had previously played in a mod rock band called The Cinnamon Firm which had recently broke up after several line up changes. The Firm were a popular live act in Ireland and had enjoyed a few local tv appearances and attracted interest from a couple of major record labels. At the same time Norm was also playing drums for a loud dirty garage rock and roll band called Thee Dreggs. Thee Dreggs vocalist and rhythm guitarist had recently left the band to set up home in Belgium. The members of the Cinnamon Firm and Thee Dreggs had been friends for years so it seemed like a natural solution to invite Hugh to get together with remaining Dreggs - Bobby (lead guitar), Will (Bass, Vocals) and Norm to form a new band. The merger brought Hugh's mod songwriting sensibilities together with raw rootsy garage band ethics. The new band was called THE KEEPERS. They managed to retain the essence and power of their old bands but with an added dynamic that gives them their own distinct brand of Belfast beat. it wasn't long before they had written a handful of songs. They recorded the tracks straight away while they were still fresh and vibrant to their ears, a philosophy they have continued through all their recordings. On May 24th of that year, the band played their first gig to a great response in front of 200 people at Belfast's Limelight club and have since been playing regularly around Northern Ireland and other places such as England, Rep of Ireland, Isle of Man, Holland, Belgium and Germany.

Their sound is ingrained with elements of garage rock, RandB, mod and punk but refuses to be pigeon-holed into any of these genres. The music is like a hit from an injected drug - instant, colourful, direct, loud, highly addictive rock 'n' roll that will mainline straight to your soul. Sick and tired of an endless slew of pop and shoe-gazing indie bands the Keepers are hitting back with raw ballsy rockin' tunes, Big ol' hairy monkey balls baby! But this is not protest music. These boys don't waste time protesting, this is DIRECT ACTION!

The Keepers' set is comprised mostly of well-crafted original material with a helping of cool covers of some of their favourite songs. Their hair-raising live reputation helped them land a weekly residency and their own club night (Balloon Farm) in Belfast's Duke of York bar, a savvy mixture of live rock 'n' roll and hip vinyl sounds which they ran for several months.

Their first single - 'Stop Pretending' was released in early 2001 and is available on seven inch vinyl from Barcelona's Butterfly Records label. The band have also released a five track CD on Italy's AUA Records as well as two self-released CD albums. Tracks by the Keepers are also available on compilation albums from labels such As El Torro and No Action.

So there you have it, good 'ol rock 'n' roll is alive and well in Belfast and these boys are the keepers of the faith. So, seek ye The Keepers and prepare for heaven!! "

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

A chance meeting with guitar virtuoso Hartley Cain led to the formation of a rock band. He rapidly built up a large fan base around the Midlands, London and Germany. The rock career lost momentum when the major album Rogues & Thieves did not take off but he did get on Top Of The Pops as part of his mate, Roy Wood¹s band, The Move. Gradually his music became more Country and he was invited by Mervyn Conn to be part of the famed Wembley Festivals. Mervyn Conn backed two albums recorded in Nashville with the Jordanaires and Hargus Pig Robbins. The first, Southern Fried Frog was and still is a massive seller. Froggie did and still does sing 99 percent of his own material and he has the largest following of any UK artist.
His autobiography, Raymond Who?, is a great read. UK singers cover more of his songs than any other writer. When he released Don't Let Me Cry Again, Terry Wogan played it every day for a fortnight but unfortunately a distribution blip stopped it being a major pop hit.
After fighting health problems he was still a major player on the UK Country scene having played with most of the major American artists including Tina Turner who recorded one of his songs. Raymond Froggatt is the only UK artist to have played the Albert Hall, London Palladium and the Birmingham Symphony Hall. He was one of an elite band who could have a theatre tour each year."

The band was formed in Colchester in December 1989 as [a=Seymour] but was renamed Blur in March 1990, after they'd signed for the Food label. Blur's early releases (the Leisure album and the singles off it) were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of ""baggy"" bands from the Madchester scene and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, at times reminding of Syd Barrett. Tthis was more readily apparent on several single B-sides where the group let loose a darker side.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music (e.g. The Kinks or XTC) or even nostalgic music from World War II. Their 2nd album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) had moderate success but began attracting attention for its Britishness but in hindsight it rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, with groups like [a=Suede] early frontrunners too. In 1994 Blur released what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album: Parklife. 1995's The Great Escape was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. 

When the 5th studio album Blur came out in 1997, the group had reinvented their sound. They severed ties from Britpop and reincorporated the art rock experimentalism of their early years, only this time the music was informed by a broader range of influences (e.g. Pavement). The album's second song Song 2 was released as a single and became a hit on alternative dancefloors. Subsequent albums 13 and Think Tank further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe.

After 13 and the subsequent tours, the band took a pause and its members pursued personal projects. In 1998 Albarn started the [a6378] project, Alex James engaged in [a120885] with Damien Hirst, and Graham Coxon released his first solo album the same year. Over the years Coxon had started struggling with alcoholism and when Blur started the recording sessions for Think Tank, it came to a point where they asked him to no longer be present. After its release in 2003 the band went on full hiatus until December 2008, when it was announced the band would reunite for concerts in London's Hyde Park (released as All The People) followed by a series of major concerts e.g. at Glastonbury 2009. The next year saw the release of a a documentary about the band ([url=https://www.discogs.com/master/898685-Blur-No-Distance-Left-To-Run]No Distance Left To Run[/url]) and of the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/241338-Blur-Fools-Day]Fool's Day[/url] single for RSD 2010.

In July 2012 a career spanning box set was released titled [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/460605-Blur-Blur-21-The-Box]Blur 21[/url], and in August 2012 the band headlined a show in Hyde Park for the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics (released as [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/500654-Blur-Parklive]Parklive[/url]). Earlier that year the band had tried to record a studio album with [a2728] as producer but that was aborted. In Autumn 2012 the band again paused its activities.

Early 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album: The Magic Whip. It had been created in 5 days in Hong Kong after a Japan tour that was cancelled in 2013. Following the Magic Whip tour the band went into hiatus again ... resurfacing in 2023 with their 9th studio album The Ballad Of Darren and a series of concerts. In April 2024 Albarn stated that their performance at Coachella was probably the band’s “last gig”. On 19 July 2024 a second documentary titled To The End opened in UK and Irish cinemas, as directed by Toby L.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

The Stranglers,Coast To Coast,71891,0,2736068,UK,2005,67.75,18,['Album'],['Rock'],['Alternative Rock'],"English rock band (New Wave, Punk, Rock), formed as the Guildford Stranglers on 11 September 1974 in Guildford, Surrey, UK.

Originally comprised of [a138932] (vocals, guitar), [a152001] (bass, vocals), [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/729232-Brian-Duffy-2]Brian Duffy[/url] aka [a432127] (drums) and [a2442678] (keys); Wärmling left the band when he moved back to Sweden in 1975 and was replaced with [a257111]. The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Greenfield's keyboards. Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Cornwell.

Briefly, in 1977, the band would be billed as [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/654126-Celia-And-The-Mutations]the Mutations[/url], where they would be fronted by vocalist [a314007]. This only lasted [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/274057-Celia-And-The-Mutations-Mony-Mony]one single[/url]; by the time the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/372625-Celia-The-Mutations-You-Better-Believe-Me]second single[/url] had released, only Burnel was still in the Mutations, featuring only on the A-side.

On the 3rd and 4th of April 1980, gigs were scheduled before Hugh was arrested on drug charges; [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/356312-The-Stranglers-And-Friends-Live-In-Concert]the gigs went ahead[/url] under the banner of [a8225560], featuring guest performers in place of Hugh.

Cornwell left in 1990 to pursue a solo career, being replaced by [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/809138-Paul-Roberts-6]Paul Roberts[/url] on vocals and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/257124-John-Ellis-2]John Ellis[/url] on guitar. During live gigs in this era, Roberts sung tracks traditionally performed by Burnel. For a 1993 tour, including the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/25623712-The-Stranglers-Live-At-Fontwell-Park-1993]Fontwell Park gig[/url], Jet was ill and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/12308956-Tim-Bruce-5]Tim Bruce[/url] filled in on drums.

Ellis left the band in 2000, passing the reins to guitarist [a629600]; when Roberts left the group in 2006 over disagreements during the recording of Suite XVI, Warne was promoted to lead vocalist also, rerecording the tracks already recorded by Roberts alongside Burnel.

Jet Black started experiencing health issues in 2007 that caused him to miss gigs; technician [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4478856-Ian-Barnard-2]Ian Barnard[/url] played in such instances. Black's live role was lessened in the 2013 tour, with [a4000000] playing the first halves of UK gigs and solely playing US gigs. Black played no gigs following March 2015, officially retiring in 2018; Macaulay's role as Black's replacement was officiated in 2016.

After contracting COVID-19 in hospital, Dave Greenfield died on the 3rd of May 2020. Following the release of Dark Matters, [a568270] became the band's new keyboardist for their final full tour in 2021-2022. Following his own poor health, Jet Black died on the 6th of December 2022."

Other members include small-but-perfectly-formed keyboard player/effects man Jeremy Dyson (who is also a writer and film/TV director) and medium-height multi-instrumentalist Tim Crusher. Mark and Steve were in cult groups DUCHAMP’S TOPEE and THE IDEAL GIANTS with Greg Johnson from LORD MONGO (see http://www.myspace.com/lordmongoband). They were also members of very noisy post-punk power trio NERVE RACK. Mark was once a guitar player in GOODBYE MR MACKENZIE (with Shirley Manson) but was sacked due to ‘ideological differences’ and the fact that he was taller than the lead singer. John Peel once noted that Steve’s group LEMON ICE CREAM were ""frankly saddled with a frightful name”. Jeremy played in indie-goth legends FLOWERS FOR AGATHA who, like Charles Manson, have an obsessive fan-base in California (see http://www.myspace.com/flowersforagatha). RUDOLF ROCKER have released records on the Mook label including a 10” EP with a hand printed cover, a coloured vinyl 7” single, a CD EP, a track on a German compilation and two excellent full-length albums. They have performed live right the way across the North Riding. The idea behind RUDOLF ROCKER is to combine melodic lines, intricate chord structures, amusing sound effects and enigmatic poetic/political lyrics with violent outburst of noise and frequent dollops of absurd, silly humour. This heady mix, whilst tantalising for the discerning listener, seems to escape the dulled ears of corporate mainstream media outlets who can’t even spell the name properly. RUDOLF ROCKER have remained, however, defiantly silent about this silence. In one sense RUDOLF ROCKER’s work is a protest against the increasing uncritical blandness and formulaic quality of contemporary popular music, especially so-called ‘indie’ music, the ‘alternative’ aspects of which seem to have completely vanished. “All that is solid melts into air” Marx once observed, a philosophy RUDOLF ROCKER wish to strongly endorse and possibly write a song about.

Formerly called Khang. Bryan Outlaw(Threads) quit during the process of writing Khang's second LP because he disliked the direction the music was going in (too slow and heavy). The band recorded the album anyway without vocals. A mutual friend suggested that Paul Catten (The Sontaran Experiment), a vocalist the band admires, could use the position, so they let him hear the CD and 30 seconds into the first track he said he needed to be involved. They changed their name during the recording of the 2004 demo because the feel was much different from Khang, and Lazarus Blackstar was born. In March 2008 Mikhell replaced Paul on vocals.

A Welsh-language release, the album received considerable airplay on Radio Cymru; one of the tracks, 'Sonar' was selected by BBC Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens for inclusion on the Dan Y Cownter showcase CD released by the Welsh Music Foundation in 2005. Later that year, a second album, Brigyn2, was released on Gwynfryn Cymunedol.
In 2006, Brigyn toured Wales, playing the Sesiwn Fawr festival in Dolgellau in July and the Green Man Festival later in the summer. A tour of Ireland soon followed. Also in 2006, the remix CD Ailgylchu was released, containing remixes by Welsh underground artists of Brigyn songs.
Brigyn achieved prominence in the media through successfully obtaining the permission of Leonard Cohen to release a Welsh-language version of his1984 song 'Hallejujah'.

Whimsical label founders EMPORIUM formed in January 1998, following a period of recording demos under the name 'Subconcious'. They attracted interest from major record label ARISTA RECORDS and A&R mogul Peter Whitehead (Muse / Radiohead / Stereophonics), and appeared on several industry A&R compilations. 

Formed in Edinburgh originally as a 3-piece (including Ewan McKenzie on vocals / synths and Brent Inglis on bass guitar), Emporium chose to remain studio based for much of the next 4 years, performing just a short series of gigs in the summer of ' 98. Around this time the song SLEEPING DOGS was receiving acclaim from radio in Scotland and indeed reached the year-end top 10 songs on BBC SCOTLAND's BEAT PATROL show, as published in NME the following January. Together with a 5-star review in GUITARIST magazine for HAPPY HIGH e.p (and cover cd), the hard work was paying off....Their first album of home recordings A FINE FINE LINE was released on PEOPLESOUND in 1999.

Over the next 18 months many songs from their debut collection were given airplay including DREAM DAY, ZOMBIE, and the 2nd ltd edition single ELEVATE which was a collaboration with FREDDIE PHILLIPS, best known for his work on the 1960's TRUMPTONSHIRE t.v programmes.

By the new millennium Emporium had notched up 17 radio plays including ZOMBIE on STEVE WRIGHT show (BBC WORLD SERVICE) and HAPPY HIGH on EVENING SESSION in Scotland (BBC RADIO ONE). A second batch of songs was completed in 2000 for the album ITS THE THOUGHT THAT GETS YOU HIGH including SALISBURY PLAIN , NO WAY OUT, and their first nationally distributed single - the now deleted EMAIL EDDIE, released on the band's own label and distributed in the Uk by Pinnacle/Shellshock on January 22nd 2001. This was followed on July 30th by the single LISA ON THE SCREEN which was airplayed in Germany, Uk, Holland, and America where it was also given a glowing review in Boston's Music Business Monthly.

The release of HALLUCINATIONS (11 track collection) on April 1st 2002 brought further positive feedback from various media, and scored ALBUM OF THE MONTH on POPSCENE (Netherlands) and PLANETE INDIE (Belgium) , where it was also ranked 3rd best album of the year from the 11 nominated albums. A single 'Sixes and Sevens' appeared the following October.

In 2003 Emporium were awarded a Scottish Arts Council Grant towards the recording of a forthcoming album. The new album 'Silver Brainwaves'(13 tracks) was released on October 10th 2005, and was preceded by a vinyl single 'Wasted' on June 27th. The single was eventually given a digital release via Itunes on May 15th 2006.

On April 2nd 2007, a remix of 'Dice Man' featured on the 21 track Whimsical compilation 'Elevate'.

During a four year sabbatical, Emporium took time to develop their own label further, contracting music for release and publishing to Whimsical and subsidiary PLATFORM RECORDS, yielding over 20 releases and winning critical acclaim with their numerous artists. A new business THE MUSIC ELEVATOR was also set up in 2010, this offering artists a release co-ordination service along with plugging to webzines and radio.

On June 13th 2011, the SILVER BRAINWAVES album was given a digital re-release while being re-promoted to various media, generating some fantastic feedback.

In 2012, Emporium returned with new tracks MINDBENDER and THE UMBRELLA SHOP, both of which feature on the 17 track compilation FROM ANOTHER PLANET - THE BEST OF EMPORIUM (1998-2011), the latter also released as a single.

A brand new 14 track Emporium album 'The Afterlife' was released on December 22nd, 2012.

A remixed version of MAGICAL THINGS came out as a single on November 11th 2013.

A free download of FUNERAL was released in 2014 via Emporium's Soundcloud page.

A new single 'Gloomy Shadows' was released on November 6th 2015. This is taken from the final EMPORIUM album 'The Electric Emporium', released February 5th 2016 along with single 'The Uninvited'. The album includes collaborations with lyricist and poet Lee Brough on the songs 'Gloomy Shadows', 'Zebra Crossing' and 'An Appointment'.

In 2020, Emporium founder Ewan McKenzie launched new venture THE McKENZIE FIX

Its playtime and its good time vibes all the way through the most infectious, toe-tappin’ tunes to come off the planet. Rhythm’n’Blues, Swing, Boogie Woogie, a bit of Burlesque (we all love a bit of Burlesque, don’t we… ;), Gospel, New Orleans sass, Jump Blues, a hint of Ska, Motown, Soul and Latin, pure fun fun fun ‘til Daddy takes the T-Bird away. Ray Charles, Jackie Wilson, Ruth Brown, LaVern Baker, Buddy Johnson Orchestra, Wynonie Harris, Big Maybelle, Wynona Carr, Lord Charles – Louis Prima, Sam Butera, Freddie Bell, Bill Haley, Tommy Cooper – Bobby Darin, Dinah Washington, The Rat Pack, Peggy Lee, Count Basie, Cirque Du Soleil – Brian Setzer Orchestra, Jools Holland Rhythm’n’Blues Orchestra, Harry Connick Jnr, Michael Buble, Amy Winehouse, Luke Skywalker – Shows, Musicals, Movies, them good bits from the TV, Forrest Gump, the list could go on and on in the intoxicating cocktail of boogie beats on The Cat Pack menu.
Formed not long after the last of the millennium fireworks went off, this big bunch of strays were not permitted into the local pets hotel as their honking V-8 engine was just too much for the bluebird, buzzard and the oriole at all hours of the day, and so commenced their journey spreading the rock-a-beatin’ boogie throughout the land. They found a base at the Ritz Ballroom, Brighouse, stopping off and having fun with the lovely folks at ‘The Swing Cats Ball’ / Stockport, ‘Vegas’ / Edinburgh, Colne Rhythm’n’Blues and Burnley Blues festivals and not to mention of course some marvellous guest houses hosted by the warm and welcoming landlord’s / landlady’s at The Primrose / Leeds, The Wardrobe / Leeds and Batley Variety Club / eh, Batley… A very kind man one day dug these cats ‘n’ kittens so much that he exchanged the saucers of milk for other round shiny things called compact discs and ‘Everybody Wants To Be A Cat’ in 2003 and ‘It Aint What You Do’ in 2005 on Raucous Records managed to get the ‘me-oww’ to other felines in far-flung places like Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and even Japan – places our master, Dick Whittington, never ever mentioned on the map to London so that was a nice surprise. And another very kind group of guys ‘n’ gals gave The Cat Pack an award at the 2002 BBC Big Band competition and that sits very proudly on the really high shelf at our master, Dick Whittington’s first home because any of the lower shelves he knows it’ll get knocked down when we’re jumping around waiting for our tea.
So amongst also sleeping a lot, curling up in a ball, doing that funny hunched-back, side-stepping jumpy thing cats do now and again, The Cat Pack discovered many other cat-lovers who were really nice to us with lots of strokes and tickles under the chin at companies like Pfizer, Sainsburys, The National Railway Museum, The Royal Armouries and Bristol Evening News; weddings, functions and charities at smashing places like Longleat House / Bath, Majestic Hotel / Harrogate, Gateshead Stadium and Aldborough Manor / North Yorkshire; and some really fun journeys at places like where our master, Dick Whittington, works a lot – Blackpool Opera House, Oldham Coliseum, Bristol Colston Hall, Halifax Victoria theatre and Leeds City Varieties – not to mention supporting two of the real original hep-cats, Little Richard and Chuck Berry when they too were wandering around the UK.
And finally, we’re dead lucky to have some of the coolest, caring, cuddly and cute cats in the world amongst the ranks. Saxophonists, Trombonists, Trumpeters, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, Vocalists; loads of very talented performers of the highest professional calibre who have also been on trips with hep-cats ‘n’ kittens like Joe Longthorne, Peter Grant, Georgie Fame, Corrine Bailey Rae, Amy Winehouse, The Drifters, Diane Schure, The Stranglers, Roy Wood, Michael Roach, BBC Big Band, Syd Lawrence Orchestra, Pasadena Roof Orchestra, Squadronaires, NYJO; shows including The Rat Pack live from Las Vegas, Chicago and Legends Reborn; venues most notably at the London Palladium, Royal Albert Hall and many UK Arenas, plus countless TV / Radio sessions, cruise ships, summer seasons and pantomimes (where we obviously met our master, Dick Whittington………)
The journey continues – see you soon you crazy cats…"

The Fish Brothers formed specifically to ""wind people up"" and got their name because that's what they drink like (ie Fish).

The nucleus of the band are Edith Charnsworth (Vocals, also known as Martin Fish, real name Martin Cooper) and Chesty Charnsworth (No relation - Guitar) and in their early days they often performed as a two piece (and occasionally still do).

Originally known as [i]The Climax Chicago Blues Band[/i], the Climax Blues Band has always focused on its roots, a unique combination of jazz and blues. The band has released 21 albums and had a Top 10 hit in the UK with Couldn't Get It Right. That song and I Love You were also hits in the United States ; Couldn't Get It Right reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977, and ""I Love You"" peaked at No. 12 in 1981

In 1985, Cooper and Glover recruited guitarist Lester Hunt, drummer Roy Adams, and original member Derek Holt to record the Climax Blues Band album Drastic Steps, and this line-up toured in support of the album in the UK, Europe and America. The new line-up soon became established with Cooper, Glover, Hunt, Adams and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s, releasing the live album Blues From The Attic in 1993 and Big Blues in 2004.

Cooper died of cancer, aged 69, in July 2008. He is survived by his wife and two children. He wanted the band to continue, as the other musicians had all been long serving (Glover since 1980, Adams and Hunt since 1985, and Simpson since 1991). Cooper was replaced by singer and saxophone and harmonica player Johnny Pugh, who retired in 2012, and was replaced in turn by vocalist Graham Dee and saxophone player Chris Aldridge. 

In 2019, Climax Blues Band released Hands Of Time, a new album of original bluesy funk, soul and jazz rock material that has received rave reviews.

After playing together in various outfits since their early teens, 2 By Bukowski was formed sometime in 1997. During their early days, the band used to record songs live in Nik’s childhood bedroom, and mail them to labels. This resulted in their first release, a split 7″ single with Lazarus Clamp, releaed in 1999 on Jonathon Whiskey. The single was named 'Record of the Month' by Record Collector magazine. It was followed by a number of singles and compilation contributions and the 2000 12″ EP “He Knows That In The Shadows Someone Is Making The Elements Bleed” on Liquefaction Empire.

2 By Bukowski’s first album “What A Long Strange Journey This Has Been” was released in 2001 by Thessaloniki label Poeta Negra, and marked the transition from homemade recordings to recording studios, while 2003’s album “Drink From My Bastard Grail” contained “Chopperfuck”, their first non instrumental composition, featuring vocals by Karine Charff of [a4090]. The band's third album, 2005’s “Yzordderex” was then released on [l16508]. The band broke a couple of years later.

Sometime in the mid '10s, the group was re-started. In 2017 they released the single ''Hot Summer"", and followed it with the single ''Follow You Home"" the next year. Both were released by Greek label Inner Ear. In November 2020, [l129690] released their first album in 15 years, called ''Her Kind Fight Everything''."

Influenced by 1970's British and Southern rock giants like Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, their songs are based around hard edged head nodding riffs, given even more guts through uncomplicated arrangements. The Daredevils have developed a modern and unique blend of rock music that stands as tall as contemporary acts such as Clutch and Wolfmother. Essentially it hinges on a 'no-bullshit' philosophy.

The last year has been busy for MCDD, having seen a national tour, a publishing deal with World Domination Music and their song ‘Bear in the Air’ being used on the multi-million selling Tony Hawk’s Proving Ground by video games giant Activision. In 2008 the band have completed their second album ‘Hot Sauce’ which is due for release in the summer accompanied by another UK tour and a string of festival dates.

The Daredevil's honed but raw live sound has been welcomed as a breath of fresh air, and has led the band to support acts such as Nashville Pussy, McQueen, Orange Goblin, Viking Skull, GU Medicine and Alabama 3. To recreate their sound in the studio they have abandoned modern digital equipment and reverted to old style recording techniques, that rely on the high quality of their songs and musicianship.

It would be a mistake to think that these guys are purists, or that they are simply regurgitating old '70's rock (as anyone who has seen them live will know). The wall of sound they generate owes more to their metal/hardcore pedigree than to their old-school influences, and leaves audiences with the certain knowledge that they have witnessed more than just three blokes, two stacks and a drumkit."

Since his early childhood he was interested in anything electronic, and music was certainly no exception. Whilst having an interest in some mainstream music, Adrian also followed the work of artists such as Jean Michael Jarre, whose awesome live shows and radical music were full of the very thing Adrian loved; electronics. At the young age of 9, Adrian began learning the piano, studying both modern and classical 'pianoforte' with ANZCA. 

One day Adrian was introduced to a simple little computer program called 'MODEDIT', one of many programs known as trackers that turn a simple PC into a powerful sample based music workstation. It was through using this program that Adrian began experimenting with electronic music, creating his own sounds, crude as they were back then however still a start. Starting with these basic tunes and tools, Adrian gradually moved onto bigger and better things, finally sticking with impulse tracker. 

Adrian began DJ'ing in 96, after meeting Robert Anthony, a young fellow with similar interests in music, and together they explored the various styles of electronica around at the time. In 1997 they joined forces in production for a short time and did some work under the alias of Nexus, which got airplay on Kiss 90 FM in Melbourne. 

During the year of 98, Adrian pulled back a little from music, as he was in the process of studying his final year of VCE. The year's dedication towards schooling paid off, with a final rank of 88.65, however as a result the piano tuition was put on hold. With high school behind him, Adrian made his first serious step towards dance music production, with the purchase of some real gear at the end of 1998.

Throughout 1999, Adrian's taste for music developed into his own form of hard trance, and he worked his set into a mixture of emotional breaks, slamming beats and peaking buildups. Under the name of DayWalker, Adrian first played to a crowd at the Coburg Festa in late 1999, which proved to be a good experience for him, as not many of his friends had heard him play until then. His next major gig was at freestyle, a free outdoor rave party in early 2000 at the Malvern Skate Park. 

Since then Adrian's work has progressed through many different genres, and has settled on a dark, dancefloor orientated hard techno sound with a twist. 

Adrian also is currently in his 4th year of a Computer Systems Engineering Degree at RMIT."

The band negotiated with EMI the creation of their own label ""[l=Total Vegas Recordings]"" and in 1992 their debut EP ""Thrive"" was released by Total Vegas followed by the band's first LP ""Formaldehyde"" later in the year.  1994 saw the release of second album ""How To Make Friends And Influence People"" which generated a string of chart hits for the band including ""Oblivion"" and ""Alice, What's The Matter?""  With third LP ""Regular Urban Survivors"" (1996) Terrorvision continued on their upward trajectory and single ""Perseverance"" earned the band their first top 5 hit with further chart success for singles ""Celebrity Hit List"" and ""Bad Actress"" though real chart domination was to come in January 1999 with the number 2 smash ""Tequila"" taken from the ""Shaving Peaches (1998) album.  Despite this, EMI chose to drop the band and in early 2000 the band (and Total Vegas Recordings) were rescued by [l=Papillon Records] for whom the band recorded the 2001 album ""Good To Go.""  The reprieve however was temporary and in June 2001 the band announced their split marked by a farewell tour of the UK and a 'best of' album to satisfy EMI's five album contract entitled ""Whales & Dolphins.""  In April 2005 the band reformed for a brief UK tour with further dates in August and September, which EMI took as a good excuse to release another compilation ""B-Sides & Rarities"".

In 2010 after replacing drummer 'Shutty', they started work on an album which was completed and released in 2011 under the title 'Super Deluxe'.

Formed in November 2000 FULC demo ""Void"" (2001) landed the band offers of recording contracts from 3 independent labels. Instead the band signed to Stunted Records and Management who sent FULC on a 15 date tour in February/March 2002 to start building a fanbase.

By July 2002 FULC were recording “The Fallen” EP at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall, following in the footsteps of Muse, Oasis, Supergrass etc. Released on September 9th 2002 on Stunted Records, FULC embarked on a 35 date promotional tour from July to Sept. 2002, and a further 20 date tour from Oct. to Dec. 2002. The EP received excellent reviews, the most impact being a live review in Kerrang and a full page Kerrang “Rising” feature in 26th Oct. 02 issue.

Never ones to stand still FULC returned to Sawmills in Jan 03 to record their debut album “Biting Insomnia” . The album was released on June 23rd 2003 on Stunted Records, with a 50 date promotional tour set up to coincide with the release. With a KKKK review in Kerrang, Metal Hammer, Powerplay magazines etc all passed comment on the quality of FULC’s songwriting. FULC hit the road again in winter 2003 for a further 20 date promotional tour, their most successful yet.

Featured on BBC Radio 1 One Music FULC were no.1 in the “Lock Up” chart for 6 months and playlisted on Radio One in July 2003. FULC were personally selected by Mary Anne Hobbs to perform at a Radio One Rock Show event in Leeds in June 2003. Mike Davies ( R1 DJ ) described FULC song “Nest” as :-

“Fantastic, Fulc have got subtlety down to a fine art,”Nest” rocks in all the right places without thrusting itself in your face. This is both melodic and bowel shakingly heavy and will have rock fans creaming themselves to catch them perform live “

FULC supported Vendetta Red, Span, Agnostic Front, Skindred, Fony, Vacant Stare, Spear of Destiny, Kinesis, Martin Grech and others. Tours were sponsored by Jagermeister alongside The Darkness, Violent Delight and This Girl. FULC headlined the second stage at the 2003 Bloodstock Festival in Derby, alongside Saxon and Paradise Lost on the main stage.

Two further 15 date UK tours took place in 2004. Recording their final album at The Chapel in South Thoresby in Oct 2004, this was followed by tours of Germany and the UK in 2005 to promote their second album ""Embrace.Destroy"" which received much critical acclaim in the UK and Germany. Shortly after the release of Embrace.Destroy in May 2005 personal circumstances led to a hiatus which the band never recovered from.

The band negotiated with EMI the creation of their own label ""[l=Total Vegas Recordings]"" and in 1992 their debut EP ""Thrive"" was released by Total Vegas followed by the band's first LP ""Formaldehyde"" later in the year.  1994 saw the release of second album ""How To Make Friends And Influence People"" which generated a string of chart hits for the band including ""Oblivion"" and ""Alice, What's The Matter?""  With third LP ""Regular Urban Survivors"" (1996) Terrorvision continued on their upward trajectory and single ""Perseverance"" earned the band their first top 5 hit with further chart success for singles ""Celebrity Hit List"" and ""Bad Actress"" though real chart domination was to come in January 1999 with the number 2 smash ""Tequila"" taken from the ""Shaving Peaches (1998) album.  Despite this, EMI chose to drop the band and in early 2000 the band (and Total Vegas Recordings) were rescued by [l=Papillon Records] for whom the band recorded the 2001 album ""Good To Go.""  The reprieve however was temporary and in June 2001 the band announced their split marked by a farewell tour of the UK and a 'best of' album to satisfy EMI's five album contract entitled ""Whales & Dolphins.""  In April 2005 the band reformed for a brief UK tour with further dates in August and September, which EMI took as a good excuse to release another compilation ""B-Sides & Rarities"".

In 2010 after replacing drummer 'Shutty', they started work on an album which was completed and released in 2011 under the title 'Super Deluxe'.

One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

After some months and one e.p. they changed their name to Pop Will Eat Itself (PWEI) and earned attention from the indie scene for their first e.p., The Poppies Say Grrr! on Chapter 22. At the time they played short, fast, slightly psychedelic punk-pop tunes and went on with that for three more e.p.'s before starting to incorporate house and hip hop beats and samples on Beaver Patrol. By autumn 1987 PWEI released their first album, Box Frenzy, with some tunes leaning towards new wave, some towards hip hop and acid house. A drum machine called Dr. Nightmare was installed and Graham Crabb took the second microphone.

After the 12"" Def.Con.One PWEI signed a deal with RCA and released Can U Dig It? in 1989, which would be the first of 12 PWEI singles going UK top 40. In the same year their seminal second album This Is The Day...This Is The Hour...This Is This! appeared to public and critical acclaim for its witty fusion of rock and electronic music.
PWEI opted for an even more electronic, slightly darker and moodier approach on Cure For Sanity, their third album, which appeared in 1990 alongside PWEI's alternative soccer world cup theme, Touched By The Hand Of Cicciolina, a fusion of dub and acid house.

Electronics took a backseat on 1992's The Looks Or The Lifestyle, when Fuzz Townshend was brought in as a drummer. PWEI reinvented themselves as grungey groovers and released Get The Girl! Kill The Baddies! as their highlight single. PWEI had been sacked by RCA at the time the single went number 9 in the UK in early 1993.

The band signed with Infectious in the UK and Nothing in the US and released R.S.V.P., Ich Bin Ein Auslander, and Everything's Cool as singles in 1993 and 1994. The tunes displayed a development from where they had left towards dark industrial rock. The mixture on their fifth album Dos Dedos Mis Amigos was received well and won the band many new fans.

Nonetheless, the band only released the remix album Two Fingers My Friends after that and collapsed upon the departure of Graham Crabb in 1996. Crabb released an album as Golden Claw Musics, Richard March went on to form Bentley Rhythm Ace, Fuzz Townshend went solo, and Clint Mansell has done film soundtracks. In 2005, a reunion tour and new songs were announced, but the reformation fizzled out by the end of the year.

In 2010, in the wake of the dissolution of Vile Evils, Graham Crabb announced his intention to reconstitute PWEI.  By 2011, Crabb had recruited new band members, and PWEI released a new album, New Noise Designed By A Sadist, and went on tour.

This track was reworked and renamed 'Carrion' which became their first UK Top 40 single in 2003. That year saw the release of their debut album 'The Decline of British Sea Power' on the Rough Trade label.
Their sophomore effort 'Open Season' was released in 2005 and spawned their first UK Top 20 single 'It Ended on an Oily Stage'. Three years later, in 2008, their third effort 'Do You Like Rock Music?' earned the band a coveted Mercury Music Prize nomination.

Sandstone,Tides Of Opinion,1873996,0,13779433,UK,2005,60.97,12,"['Album', 'Promo']",['Rock'],[],"Sandstone is a 5 piece melodic metal band for Derry in Northern Ireland founded in 2003 by Stevie McLaughlin (lead guitar) and Sean McBay (vocals)
Their mix of tight Power Metal spiced with a decent dash of melodious Progressive is riveting and reminds you a bit of Fates Warning, Iron Maiden, Queensryche, or even Guns'n'Roses. The latter may be a bit odd, some will say, but SANDSTONE dare and manage the almost impossible, creating a versatile, exciting, and unique style.

From the beginning Sandstone are committed to writing their own material and working in their own studio, Stevie's brother David McLaughlin (bass) and Paddy Flemming (drums) join the two, completing the band. The foursome wants to perform their songs live as soon as possible - which they do, turning SANDSTONE into a household name in the Irish scene very fast. 2006, they sign a deal with Casket Records, and the label releases their debut album ""Tides Of Opinion"", consisting mainly of material written since 2003. The album, containing twelve songs recorded in their own studio, is very well received by the press, the gist of it being ""I haven't heard such an impressive Hard Rock album for a long time"".

""Tides of Opinion"" opens a lot of doors for SANDSTONE: they play numerous gigs, and also a tour the UK in 2006/2007. Even hyper-critical British music magazine Kerrang! is crazy about the band's outstanding live performance. 2008, they start working on the successor of ""Tides Of Opinion"". Once again, the band is recording in their own studio, thus being independent of tight time schedules and pressure - and the new compositions mirror that advantage. 

Right from the start, ""Purging the Past” is a statement: these young men have matured as a band, and they have honed their songwriting and stylistic skills remarkably. This album is also released by Casket Records and gets brilliant reviews. No wonder LIMB MUSIC is interested in this gifted combo (being a perfect fit for their band roster): the label licenses the album right away. 

So, finally ""Purging The Past"" is released beyond Ireland - with a new artwork, remixed by the band, and remastered by Uwe Lulis (Rebellion, ex-Grave Digger). The 12 songs on the album are versatile, catchy and impress you with classy songwriting. 

After the critical success of second CD 'Purging the Past' described by Bruce Dickinson as ""the most promising thing to come out of Ireland in years"", Sandstone raised the bar with their 3rd release 'Cultural Dissonance'. 
Cultural Dissonance depicts a band that is not afraid to grow and evolve both as performers and as songwriters: Still apparent is Sandstone's hallmark, dynamic and emotive lyrics and meticulously crafted melodies, but now with a new directness and technical intensity. They had finally found a way to forge their diverse influences and creative ideas into one coherent style that somehow manages to be ballad-like and heartfelt yet bone-crushingly heavy at the same time. 
The album was a great success for the band and the press rewards the band with fantastic reviews, describing the alum as ‘A small masterpiece’ and ‘an album that can combine the fast and melodic elements of Power Metal, with complexity of Progressive, into a mixture that has no weak points’.

A band doesn’t release music of this quality without creating demand from fans across Europe to see them live, and the success of Cultural Dissonance created the opportunity for Sandstone to tour across Europe as main support to Tim ‘Ripper’ Owens of Judas Priest fame. Cutting their teeth on the live European circuit, the band rises to the challenge gaining many new fans and admirers on their journey across Europe and Eastern Europe, and adding a charismatic second guitarist to the mix Dee (Kivi) Kivlehan. The tour sees the band grow into a well oiled metal machine and the biggest hit of the tour is their performance of the song Sleep from Cultural Dissonance which takes advantage of the exceptional guitar skills of founding member Stevie and soaring vocals of Sean. The band got on so well with the ex Judas Priest front man that he even offers to perform on their next release.

No sooner is the tour ended and this committed and prolific band are back in the studio putting together the current release Delta Viridian: A semi concept album based loosely on themes from the classic novel Cat’s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut. The album deals with such lyrical ideas as religion, nihilism, and mankind’s neurotic infatuation with self destruction and witnesses a consolidation of the band’s unique approach to melodic and sincere story telling over a musical palette of all that’s good in the genres they love. Sandstone make a virtue of walking the fine line between hard rock, power metal and progressive rock, allowing all three approaches to constantly battle each other and never conceding a victor. The result is additively compulsive listening."

Electronics took a backseat on 1992's The Looks Or The Lifestyle, when Fuzz Townshend was brought in as a drummer. PWEI reinvented themselves as grungey groovers and released Get The Girl! Kill The Baddies! as their highlight single. PWEI had been sacked by RCA at the time the single went number 9 in the UK in early 1993.

The band signed with Infectious in the UK and Nothing in the US and released R.S.V.P., Ich Bin Ein Auslander, and Everything's Cool as singles in 1993 and 1994. The tunes displayed a development from where they had left towards dark industrial rock. The mixture on their fifth album Dos Dedos Mis Amigos was received well and won the band many new fans.

Nonetheless, the band only released the remix album Two Fingers My Friends after that and collapsed upon the departure of Graham Crabb in 1996. Crabb released an album as Golden Claw Musics, Richard March went on to form Bentley Rhythm Ace, Fuzz Townshend went solo, and Clint Mansell has done film soundtracks. In 2005, a reunion tour and new songs were announced, but the reformation fizzled out by the end of the year.

In 2010, in the wake of the dissolution of Vile Evils, Graham Crabb announced his intention to reconstitute PWEI.  By 2011, Crabb had recruited new band members, and PWEI released a new album, New Noise Designed By A Sadist, and went on tour.

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

After some months and one e.p. they changed their name to Pop Will Eat Itself (PWEI) and earned attention from the indie scene for their first e.p., The Poppies Say Grrr! on Chapter 22. At the time they played short, fast, slightly psychedelic punk-pop tunes and went on with that for three more e.p.'s before starting to incorporate house and hip hop beats and samples on Beaver Patrol. By autumn 1987 PWEI released their first album, Box Frenzy, with some tunes leaning towards new wave, some towards hip hop and acid house. A drum machine called Dr. Nightmare was installed and Graham Crabb took the second microphone.

After the 12"" Def.Con.One PWEI signed a deal with RCA and released Can U Dig It? in 1989, which would be the first of 12 PWEI singles going UK top 40. In the same year their seminal second album This Is The Day...This Is The Hour...This Is This! appeared to public and critical acclaim for its witty fusion of rock and electronic music.
PWEI opted for an even more electronic, slightly darker and moodier approach on Cure For Sanity, their third album, which appeared in 1990 alongside PWEI's alternative soccer world cup theme, Touched By The Hand Of Cicciolina, a fusion of dub and acid house.

Electronics took a backseat on 1992's The Looks Or The Lifestyle, when Fuzz Townshend was brought in as a drummer. PWEI reinvented themselves as grungey groovers and released Get The Girl! Kill The Baddies! as their highlight single. PWEI had been sacked by RCA at the time the single went number 9 in the UK in early 1993.

The band signed with Infectious in the UK and Nothing in the US and released R.S.V.P., Ich Bin Ein Auslander, and Everything's Cool as singles in 1993 and 1994. The tunes displayed a development from where they had left towards dark industrial rock. The mixture on their fifth album Dos Dedos Mis Amigos was received well and won the band many new fans.

Nonetheless, the band only released the remix album Two Fingers My Friends after that and collapsed upon the departure of Graham Crabb in 1996. Crabb released an album as Golden Claw Musics, Richard March went on to form Bentley Rhythm Ace, Fuzz Townshend went solo, and Clint Mansell has done film soundtracks. In 2005, a reunion tour and new songs were announced, but the reformation fizzled out by the end of the year.

In 2010, in the wake of the dissolution of Vile Evils, Graham Crabb announced his intention to reconstitute PWEI.  By 2011, Crabb had recruited new band members, and PWEI released a new album, New Noise Designed By A Sadist, and went on tour.

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

This founding line-up evolved out of previous combos with fluid memberships such as To Suckle The Pups and BackDrumMower.
The INECTO SCHOOL's instrumentation of double bass, trumpet/flugelhorn, drumkit, voice, guitar and percussion resembled that of a jazz band and their method was totally improvised but their music did not fall easily into any single musical category.
They recorded their music extensively in private sessions and performed live at concerts in Leeds and Glasgow through 2003-04, supporting artists such as Jack Rose, Frog Pocket, The One Ensemble of Daniel Padden and McWatt.  Recordings of these INECTO SCHOOL concerts were issued as 'The Together Road Tapes' (2CDR set) in 2005.
INECTO SCHOOL produced several self-released albums in small runs on CDR, with handmade covers, beginning with St. Vitus' Dance (2004); Wrangthorn (2004) and Night Works (2010). The band assembled their albums as 'scrapbooks' made up of edited extracts from longer improvised recordings. Sessions taped in 2003-04 provided the source material for all the group's album releases up to 2010.  These albums were co-produced/mastered variously by Daniel Padden, Matthew Robson and Alan Jenkins.
In September 2004 the original line-up ceased playing together with the relocation of two members abroad. 
In 2022 THE INECTO SCHOOL published a re-issue box set of its first three albums (supplemented by selected concert recordings) as RITUAL STILLS in an edition of 100, including facsimiles of original artwork and an illustrated booklet."

The group recorded six albums in the seventies, the opening trio of which were on John Peel's Dandelion label. Fiddler & Hope Evans formed Medicine Head in 1969. At the end of 1971, Peter left for about nine months and John continued the band with John Davis on drums and [a445544] on bass guitar. They left when Peter returned in the summer of 1972 and the band once again became a duo. It came off the road in October 1973 while Peter and John recruited three more musicians.

Medicine Head switched from [l38282] to Polydor as Hope-Evans returned for the album One & One Is One, recorded with various session musicians. The title track became the band's biggest hit, reaching no.3 in the UK in 1973, and they followed it up with Rising Sun (no. 11). For the next album Thru' A Five, the duo were augmented on a regular basis by [a287213] of Family on drums, [a287216] on guitar, and [a426498] on bass. The album featured the Slim Harpo-influenced song Slip and Slide which became the band's final hit, reaching no.22 in the UK in 1974. Despite consistent touring, often as a supporting act, Medicine Head failed to place an album on the UK Albums Chart. For their final album Two Man Band, recorded at Pete Townshend's Eel Pie Studios, they reverted to being a duo.

Medicine Head finally folded in 1977. In 2005, Angel Air released the album Don't Stop The Dance, a 'lost' album, compiling some singles from an unsuccessful period with [l33191] and some unreleased sessions of the band as a five piece. John Fiddler released solo albums after the breakup of the band but revived the Medicine Head name for Fiddlersophical in 2011. In 2020 Cherry Red released a 50th Anniversary edition of the New Bottles Old Medicine debut with a second disc of singles, sessions & live material spanning the 1970-1975 period."

One of seven children, born to a Baptist church minister, she began singing and touring the South with the Georgia Hot Harlem Revue at the age of fourteen. She also played drums and harmonica and signed her first contract in Houston with Peacock Records in 1951.

In the latter part of her career Thornton appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 & 1968, and the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1979. In 1966 she recorded the album Big Mama Thornton With The Chicago Blues Band on the Arhoolie label. She wrote a total of twenty-two blues releases.

Thornton died in Los Angeles in 1984 of heart and liver complications, compounded by years of alcohol abuse. It was the same year that she was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall Of Fame.

Originally called ""Rupert & The Beards"", the band have been playing together for over 15 years. Their early sound was more funk than anything else but after leaving university and moving to a shared house their music became more eclectic and experimental. After Sherwood decided to leave the band Wensley became a second keyboard/synth player. As there was no bass player the two keyboards shared rhythm, bass and melody duties which gave the band a distinctive sound. All five members write the songs, both individually and collectively. An early EP, ‘Telephone Heroes”, was followed be their first album, Experiment with Mother. Recorded at home, it was released by Bristol Label Sink and Stove Records along with the single ‘Like It Or Leave It”. Having gigged regularly for many years around Bristol they began to play further a-field. This led to them acquiring management and subsequently signing a deal with Island Records. The band recorded the album ‘Lick Your Ticket’ in 2003 with producer Steve Osborne at Realworld Studios. They released a number of singles from it and toured extensively, playing with bands such as Kasabian, the Kaiser Chiefs and the Charlatans as well as at Glastonbury and V festivals. However, they were unable to sell enough records to make a sufficient return on the large investment Island had made in them and their contract was not extended to another album. Whilst working in Berlin with dance producers Tiefschwarz they were seen performing by Kitty-Yo Records who signed the album up for release in GAS . Their next record, ‘Brace, Brace’ was licensed by Weekender among other labels. Produced by Bruno Ellingham this album featured the single, ‘You Said’ which enjoyed a lot of airplay and allowed the band to play a large number of gigs across Europe. Their most recent album ‘Bitten’ was written and recorded at Studio East in Berlin; a studio run by their guitarist East. Funded by BMG Rights and distributed by Rough Trade it features the single ‘Bitte Bitte’."

They arose out of Los Angeles's glam metal scene and gained notoriety for their over the top stage shows, which included the band throwing raw meat into the audience, scantily clad women on stage, and Lawless's spark-shooting codpiece.  

The group's first single, ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" brought further infamy.  

The band was commercially successful throughout most of the 1980's but also caught the attention of parent's groups, most significantly the PMRC.  Lawless continues to record and tour under the W.A.S.P. banner with various line ups. 

In the 2000s, he reclaimed the Christian faith of his youth and subsequently began toning down his stage shows and censoring some of the lyrics to some of his older, more explicit songs during live performances.  

He has also publicly stated that he will no longer play ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" due to his religious faith."

His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768].

This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond. However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG. Phil Mogg and Andy Parker were still members of UFO by 2019, when the band began what they called a farewell tour. Mogg's health issues resulted in UFO cancelling what was planned to be one last tour in 2022, and in April 2024, he confirmed that the band was finished."

Ann Matthews and Alan Holmes were previously members of Welsh language post-punk band Fflaps between 1987 and 1993, touring Europe, releasing three LPs, and recording two John Peel Sessions during that time. When the band's drummer Jonny Evans left in 1993, they recruited old friend Maeyc Hewitt and morphed into the quite different sounding Ectogram.

The band initially recorded two singles for the small Welsh independent label, Atol, before being signed to the more well-known Ankst label, for whom they recorded an album and two EPs. When that label dissolved in 1998, Ectogram stayed with Ankstmusik, the label set up by one of the former Ankst partners.

Their music combines conventional rock elements such as repetitive rhythms and vocal melody with atonal discord and improvisation. Their style has been influenced by bands such as Sonic Youth, Faust, Pere Ubu, My Bloody Valentine and Acid Mothers Temple.

All three members of Ectogram were also members of the experimental rock supergroup The Serpents, who released an album on the Ochre label in 1999.

During 2005, Ectogram played a series of gigs with krautrock group Faust, at times joining them on stage for a collaborative performance, and in 2012 they acted as a backing band for a performance by ex - Can member Damo Suzuki.

Drummer Maeyc Hewitt died of cancer 2 October 2015 and the band's website suggested that this was possibly the end of Ectogram as a band."

Sugiyama released his eponymous first album in 1994 backed by Phil Williams and Mike Caswell of Walk on Fire, Andy Smith of Hot chocolate, Cutting Crew’s rhythm section and Zoot Money. Playing on the London blues club circuit, Sugiyama’s on stage bands in 1990s at various times featured Boz Burrell of Bad Company, John Cook of Rory Gallagher Band, Sam Kelly and the guitarist Paul Wassif. The album received airplay by Paul Jones and Sugiyama supported Eric Bell, appeared on Live TV and jammed with Otis Grand and members of Jeff Healey Band at Roadhouse in Covent Garden.

Sugiyama's self-published studio albums in 2000s featured Clem Clempson of Colosseum, Pete Brown (who co-wrote and co-produced the albums), Zoot Money and Ben Matthews of Thunder.

In July 2016, Sugiyama with the producer Mune Sugiyama released a single Melting Away, which was a collaboration with Andy Fraser, the former Free bassist. The track was written by Sugiyama and featured Rietta Austin on vocals, Mune Sugiyama on the drums and Fraser on the bass. The release became one of the last recordings by Andy Fraser. The video of Melting Away became a track of the week on Classic Rock website and Sugiyama was invited to perform at Annual Free Convention in Newcastle in 2016.

After releasing ""Happiness,"" and its sister remix album ""Blissed Out,"" in 1990, Waddington left the band the following year.
The Beloved returned in 1993 as a duo of Jon & his wife Helena with the single ""Sweet Harmony,"" a major hit in the UK and across Europe. The album ""Conscience,"" followed and 2 more singles. Followed in 1996 by the album ""X,"" with the top 20 hit ""Satellite.""

Born on 4 July 1922 in Cincinnati, Ohio (USA)
Died on 25 August 1975 in Oahu, Hawaii.

James Edward Baker aka [a1045845] was an ex-marine World War 2 veteran and wannabe Hollywood stuntman when he fell in with a group called the Nature Boys, who maintained a vegetarian diet and lived according to Nature's laws. He studied Vedantic theology and became a follower of Yogi Bajan, a teacher of Kundalini Yoga who had followed a number of other spiritual teachers from India to Los Angeles in the late sixties. Baker became disenchanted with Bajan when the Yogi declared that he was not god. Baker took the title himself, changing his name to Father Yod.

In 1969 Baker founded the Source Restaurant on the Sunset Strip in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. It became both a profitable health food restaurant and recruitment center for his growing cult of lost and wayward youths - the [a1045843]. The commune espoused a philosophy that included kindness to animals, raw vegetarian diet, cotton clothing, and sex sans orgasm. Over 100 ""family members"" lived in a 3-bedroom house in Nichols Canyon, where sleeping arrangements involved a beehive-like complex of cubbyholes. During this period the group would record long psychedelic jams and press records to be sold at the restaurant.

In 1974, a newborn in the group developed a staphylococcus infection. Upon their arrival at UCLA Medical Center, doctors immediately notified police of suspected child endangerment. Baker felt this was an appropriate time to relocate the entire family to Kauai, Hawaii, which happened on 1974-12-26. But his term there was short and ended in misfortune. One of the group was participating in a hang-gliding contest on the island of Oahu and Baker wanted to try it out too. His first and last flight on the morning of August 25th, 1975 ended with him breaking his back after crashing onto a rocky beach on the eastern shore. Followers carried Baker back to the house but prayer and meditation still found him dead later that day. They kept his body for three and a half days chanting Yod He Vau He. After the vigil over his body, Baker was cremated. His disciples scattered within two years after his passing but have stayed in touch and are still working together to share his teachings."

A professional at twenty, he played with Charlie Musselwhite, Canned Heat, The Rolling Stones, and John Mayall before starting a solo career.

Mandel was one of a group of prominent 1960s midwestern Jewish bluesmen, including Michael Bloomfield, Corky Siegel, Barry Goldberg, and Bob Margolin, along with New York City-bred Al Kooper (born Alan Peter Kuperschmidt) and Philadelphia’s David Bromberg. A number of these musicians wound up crossing musical paths at some point with fellow Jewish-American midwesterner Bob Dylan.

Mandel was valued so highly by his peers for his innovative guitar work that he came within inches of joining the Rolling Stones as a replacement guitarist after Mick Taylor quit in 1974. He auditioned for the band, and his guitar work can be heard on two songs from the Stones’s 1976 album “Black and Blue”: “Hot Stuff” and “Memory Motel.” (Some English guy named Ronnie Wood, formerly of Rod Stewart’s band, got the full-time gig.) Mandel also played with bluesman Charlie Musselwhite and for English guitarist John Mayall’s legendary band, the Bluesbreakers.

Mandel, who was born in 1945, still performs and records.

King Crimson,"April 12, 1971 - Zoom Club, Frankfurt, Germany",70828,0,733179,UK,2005,77.38,9,"['MP3', 'Album', 'Club Edition']","['Jazz', 'Rock']","['Art Rock', 'Jazz-Rock', 'Prog Rock']","were an English-based progressive rock band formed in 1968. One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer). In 2016 [a=Jeremy Stacey] (drums, keyboards) joined as an eighth member making the group a ""double quartet"".

The band toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Levin and Jakszyk had earlier said that the North America tour was probably the band's last there."

Clearly not an ELR-compatible piece of music, the duo created SonVer as a vehicle to allow for further experimentation. A 4-track promo CD-R (which included 'Until The Stones Melt') was recorded and given out to friends and promoters in early 2004.

The first SonVer live performances took place during the summer of 2004. Often part-improvised, these first performances often took place in venues such as theatre foyers, bars and art galleries, reflecting the alt-classical style of SonVer's music. 

In 2005, SonVer shows became more regular and started to incorporate live visuals (courtesy of filmmaker Simon Bryant) to complement the soundtrack feel of the music. SonVer's self-titled debut album was also released in 2005 and received positive reviews. The album included darker, industrial-influenced tracks such as 'Last Thursday', 'Procession' and 'Khat Show Host' which enabled SonVer to cross over into more conventional gig venues such as The Foundry, 93ft East and The Spitz in London, where SonVer performed a number of shows. 

Other notable shows around this time included Ashton Court Festival in Bristol, Shambala Festival, Fimbulvetr in Edinburgh and Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig - 2006 being the first of SonVer's two appearances at the festival.  

In Spring 2007, the ""Vigil EP"" was released, the title track having been a highlight of live sets for some time. Around the same time, SonVer expanded to a 4-piece with former Hush The Many members Alistair Richardson and Ruban Byrne joining on drums & guitar respectively. The first show with the new line-up took place at the Luminaire in Kilburn, the second some 6 months later at the Union Chapel in Islington, where several brand new tracks were debuted. 

2008 started with a one-off show in Lisbon, a triple-header with Naevus and Rose McDowall. A limited edition 6-track CD featuring all three groups was released to coincide with the date.
  
Shortly afterwards, SonVer released the collaborative '3 Songs'  EP with Belgian alt-jazz act Elephant Leaf, whose singer Lucie Dehli joined SonVer onstage at a second show at The Union Chapel in May. Continuing the collaboration theme, SonVer performed in the film tents at Green Man & Latitude Festivals during the summer alongside Lautrec (Ed Simpson); with SonVer's music providing a live re-score to an edited version of the classic film '2001: A Space Odyssey'.   

SonVer's second album 'Luz del Abyss' was finally released at the end of 2008, launched with a third show at The Union Chapel. With a more accessible post-rock sound than its predecessor, the album's centrepoint was the euphoric 'Ebusus', for which the group's only official promotional video was made. 

In April 2009, SonVer played two sold-out nights at Jackson's Lane Theatre in Hampstead as part of 'Resonate', a production featuring dance & acrobatic performances.   

2009 also saw the group return to AV territory with their conceptual 'Alchemy of Man' set, which incorporated seven films by seven different filmmakers from across Europe. Each film was a visual representation of one of the seven stages of alchemical transformation - and a reconfigured setlist (including two new, unreleased tracks) was devised as a live soundtrack to the films. This AV show debuted at Brighton Fringe Festival in May, before being taken to The Cube in Bristol and Latitude Festival in July. 

In between these shows, SonVer returned to Leipzig for WGT, performing on a bill which included Cranes and I Like Trains at the stunning Volkspalast Kuppelhalle venue.   

The Latitude Festival show proved to be the end of an era however, as it was announced shortly afterwards that Richardson and Byrne were no longer members of SonVer. 

Jo performed a couple of solo shows in the following weeks as SonVer in London and Brighton, before a new 3-piece line-up (Jo Quail, Ben McLees and percussionist Will Connor) formed to play three 'Alchemy of Man' shows in London, Zottegem (Belgium) and at Bath Film Festival. 

These shows featured a radically different setlist to the previous dates; Quail & McLees returning to the more experimental/ambient sound of the debut album, enhanced by Connor's inventive and unconventional percussion & fx.  These three sets only included three previously released SonVer tracks ('Until The Stones Melt', 'Procession' and 'Vigil') and otherwise consisted entirely of brand new compositions (several of which later appeared on Quail's debut solo album). 

Ben McLees left SonVer at the start of 2010 to concentrate on his own This Is Radio Silence project. Quail & Connor continued as a duo for a short time and performed a handful of shows prior to disbanding, including an improvised set with Can legend Damo Suzuki at The Luminaire in Kilburn. 

Shortly afterwards, Jo Quail started (and continues) to work solo under her own name, touring extensively worldwide and releasing several critically acclaimed albums & EPs.

At the time, the band's sound was unlike that of any of its contemporaries in the then fledgling Japanese ska scene, and over the course of the past 21 years, their innovation has proved to have been very influential on Japanese music as a whole. Its sound, the product of the musical influences of its numerous members, is an eclectic mix of traditional ska, jazz, and rock. In the vein of many other more traditional ska acts, many of Skapara's songs are purely instrumental. Since its’ inception, the band has gone on several nationwide tours of Japan, and have toured extensively worldwide. They have collaborated with several vocalists outside of their band, including Shiina Ringo, Akira Kobayashi, Kyōko Koizumi, Schadaraparr, PUFFY and Tamio Okuda. They also performed the Japanese theme song to the PlayStation 2 game Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, entitled ""BLACK JACK""."

Overkill,Devil By The Tail,273827,0,4123633,UK & Europe,2005,121.08,23,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Thrash', 'Heavy Metal']","Speed/Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from New Jersey (USA).

The band known for rejecting several names, which includes ""Virgin Killer"", this new band finally settled on ""Overkill"", naming themselves after a [a233658] album.
Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz!) project, a punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendolo.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motorhead (""Overkill"", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest (""Tyrant"" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.

In 1981, guitarists Dan Spitz (later of Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendolo left the band and Rich Conte entered with Mike Sherry. At this point, they started writing originals, including ""Grave Robbers"", ""Raise the Dead"", ""Overkill"", and ""Unleash the Beast Within"". More originals would follow, including ""Rotten to the Core"". Somewhere around this time Rich and Dan left and Bobby entered with Joe somebody on guitars. The band became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs around 1982, and soon Bobby lived up to his ""Blitz"" nickname, earning an ejection from the band for a few days in 1983!

Around this time, the fluorescent green logo was adopted - it was specifically chosen to stand out on a poster with lots of red logos of other bands on the bill.

The lineup would stay consistent until 1987, when ""Rat"" Skates left the band. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a few gigs, and then on a permanent basis Sid Falck, previously of Paul Di'anno's Battlezone. (Bobby Blitz once said that the only former member he misses is co-founder Rat Skates.) Then, in 1990, Bobby G. left and was replaced by Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant (Faith or Fear).

This lineup lasted until 1992, when Tim Mallare came in on drums. Rob and Merritt both left the band in 1995 (Rob became a motorcycle racer, and Merritt formed several other bands), being replaced by Joe Comeau (Liege Lord) and Sebastian Marino. Joe left in 1999 to become the vocalist for Annihilator, and the Coverkill album was recorded with new guitarist Dave Linsk. Sebastian left to spend more time with family, so Linsk played all the guitar parts on 2000's Bloodletting album, and Derek Tailor joined for the subsequent tour, and was also featured on Killbox 13. Tim Mallare left Overkill on his own accord after 14 years with the band in 2005.

Bobby ""Blitz"" Ellsworth: vocals (1980-)
Carlo ""D.D. Blaze"" Verni: bass  (1980-)

The original Magic Band, formed by guitarist [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Alex+St.+Clair+Snouffer]Alexis Snouffer[/url] in the mid-sixties, had become a popular rhythm n' blues group ""Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band"". By the release of their debut album ""Safe As Milk"" there was much conflict within the group, leading to dramatic changes in its musical direction. With the founder members gone and a troubled trail of label-changes and contract disputes, Don Van Vliet emerged to take control in new directions with his [a92623] produced opus ""Trout Mask Replica"". This was followed by eight further official albums, released under his Beefheart persona, until his retirement in 1982.

On completion of the album ""Unconditionally Guaranteed"", on which Magic Band founder Snouffer reappeared, the entire band once again had disputes with Vliet and departed. A replacement ensemble was quickly formed for the album's 1974 tour. Lacking full understanding or rehearsals of the Beefheart catalog, this line-up is often cuttingly referred to by passionate followers as 'The Tragic Band'.

Born 1970 in Palau, a small port in northern Sardinia

He started to play guitar when he was nine. 

In 1989, he moved to Bologna and started to play with various contemporary music ensembles, practicing collective composition and improvisation

In 1993, he met Giovanni Scanu, a legendary Sardinian guitar player who taught him the forms and the components of the canto a chitarra gallurese e logudorese, old songs in the Sardinian dialects of Gallurese and Logudorese, traditionally accompanied by guitar.  From this clash between avant-garde and popular tradition came Angeli’s Sardinian prepared-guitar: an instrument with 18 strings—a hybrid between baritone guitar, cello, and drums, replete with hammers, pedals, and variable pitch propellers. Since 1997, he has played concerts with his modified guitar all over the world at some of the most important festivals and theaters of Europe, Japan, Australia, North and South America, Russia, and Africa. 

Angeli has a degree in ethnomusicology and has digitalized the Archivio Mario Cervo, the most important collection of Sardinian records and traditional music. As a researcher, he has published Canto in Re, a volume of historical analysis of the cantu a chittera. With Nanni Angeli, he is the artistic director of Isole che parlano, an international arts festival that has taken place in Palau since 1996.

Considered by some to be part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, their second album [m=57707] gave its name to a new style on which they exerted a major influence. 

Most of their original material was written by bassist/frontman [a=Conrad Lant] ([a=Cronos]) and guitarist [a=Jeffrey Dunn] ([a=Mantas]) and featured satanic imagery. Dunn left the band in 1986 and the group split the following year, with Lant forming a new band [a=Cronos (2)] with some of the other members. This left drummer [a=Anthony Bray] ([a=Abaddon]) as only original member. [a=Tony Dolan] ([a=Demolition Man (3)]) was recruited to replace frontman Lant. In 1992 the new formation disbanded and in 1995 the classic line-up reformed. By 1999 internal conflicts led to several new line-up changes with Lant remaining as frontman. In 2015 Dolan, Bray and Dunn formed [a=Venom Inc.] to continue the legacy of the 1988-1992 incarnation of Venom."

Over the years coL has remained true to this style, even going as far as improvising several albums' lyrics on the spot. Independence and forward thinking have always been at the forefront of coL's work. In 2001, he founded the underground label: JesusWarhol Records. A year later, after shooting his first music video, he created: Factory 3 Films. Directing videos for Spookey Ruben, R. Stevie Moore, and Pikelet among others. Next came Dead Designs to highlight his Graphics, which includes work for Lilys and Tones On Tail. 
 
He has collaborated with various underground artists: OFFBEAT (with Aaron Embry), Atheif (with Ariel Pink), Colour Sons (with Doleful Lions) Tall Children (with Karoline Hausted), as well as working with Of Life and Richard Sax Ross as producer.

Richard Youngs is a British musician with a prolific and diverse output, including many collaborations.

He plays many instruments, most commonly choosing the guitar, but he has been known to use a wide variety of other instruments including the shakuhachi, accordion, theremin, dulcimer, a home-made synthesizer (common on early recordings) and even a motorway bridge. He also released an album which was entirely a cappella.

For many years, live performances were very occasional and almost always in Glasgow; he has stated publicly that he finds live performance ""incredibly nerve-racking: stomach cramps, tension headaches..."". However, in recent years, he has performed more regularly (including a tour of New Zealand in 2010 and a UK tour in support of Damon and Naomi in 2011) and many of his recent shows have been predominantly vocal - he told The Wire (issue 284) ""I went to a laptop concert and decided I was going to sing""."

Wild Turkey,You & Me In The Jungle,714834,0,8644357,UK,2006,0.0,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Classic Rock'],"After playing for Jethro Tull from 1967 to 1970 (he recorded three albums), bassist [a=Glenn Cornick] left the band and formed Wild Turkey with the following musicians: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass),  [a=Graham Hedley Williams] (Guitar), [a=Tweke Lewis] ( Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Drums) and [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (vocals). After a short period of time, the line-up was changed, Weathers and Williams left, replaced by [a2067822] (Guitar and Voice) and [a=Jeff Jones (2)] (Drums). This line-up features the album ""Battle Hymn"" on [l=Chrysalis Music], dated 1971 in Hard-Rock style with Progressive and Blues-Rock veins. The electric guitar and vocals are the protagonists, supported by a solid rhythm section and the record alternates more pushed tracks with other more melodic. The feedback is positive for both critics and audiences, thanks in part to their excellent live performances supporting bands such as Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, Procol Harum, Yes, Ten Years After and Zz Top. Despite the success of the first album and the live band changed again, Blackmore left the group replaced by [a=Mick Dyche] (Slide Guitar, Guitar and vocals) and [a=Steve Gurl] (Piano) added to the five. The sextet released a single called ""Good old days"", containing an unreleased B-side: ""Life Is a Symphony"", before the album ""Turkey"" also in 1972, in the hope of confirming and improving the success of the first work, but it was not so. The record is less incisive than the previous one, despite the excellent technical skills of the musicians and the addition of keyboards, they churn out a good record but that has a lesser impact than the pfirst. After a couple of years without any new record production and having had other changes in the line-up, [a=Bernie Marsden] (Guitar) replaces Dyche and [a=Kevin Currie] (Drums) takes Jones's place and in the mid of 1974 Wild Turkey disband, each member takes different musical path. Until 1996, when [a=Glenn Cornick], supported by the band's historical members, give Life at the Wild Turkey's second era, reforming the group and recording the third album 22 years after their dissolution. The reunion of ""Stealer of Years"" on [l=HTD Records] involves: [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica), [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass, Mandolin, Penny Whistle), [a=Tweke Lewis] (Electric guitar and acoustics, Backing Vocals), [a=Brian Thomas (25)] (Drums) and [a=Lee Morris (10)] (Keyboards) as guest. The sound differs from the 70s Turkey, oriented more towards blues-rock than the hard-rock of the first records. Well arranged and performed, more melodic tracks alternate with others more in the Rock vein for a pleasant return on the scene. The band seems to be ready to walk the stage again, instead the following studio album takes another 10 years, during which only two albums containing live recordings from the previous period are released: ""Final Performance"" in 2000 and ""Live in Edinburgh"" in 2001 by [l=Audio Archives] label. In 2002, a collection containing a repertoire of studio recordings from the 1970s was released by the same label. In 2006 they came out ""You & Me In The Jungle"" produced on [l=Wild Turkey Music Ltd] and the artists involved are: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass), [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Harmonic), [a=Mick Dyche] (Guitar, Bass, Voice), [a=Steve Gurl] (Keyboards), [a=Clive Bunker] (Drums), Graham Williams (Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Percussions, Vocals). Again the sound of the album differs from the first two, the tracks are different from one to another by genre, some more Blues, others more Rock, passing through Boogie moments or more Melodics, always maintaining an high-level technique in the performance. The latest album released by Wild Turkey is the ""Live at Wellington 1973"" also on [l=Audio Archives].

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

About: Doll Set Tones was an Original Material Rock band 2005-2013

Doll Set Tones are a melodic rock band based in Maldon, Essex.
The band have been together for six years and have produced four albums of original material.
Lucky 13,Freedom to Dream, Silence the Prophets, and Melophobia.

The band started when singer/songwriter Lee Probert hooked up again with his old friend and bass player, Ross Fifield (who was formally in Lee's old band the Blue Sunset)

Local percussionist and all round nice fella James Bacon (Jimi Stix) was next to join. He was recommended to Lee through his brother Nick who used to attend poetry readings.

So with the line-up almost complete, last to join but most essential was Keith Jackson (k fingers jackson) who with his haunting lead parts
and kick ass solos gave D.S.T that final squeeze of lemon.

Most recently D.S.T have just finished putting a Rock 'n' Roll covers album You Kids Are Gonna Love It together including an exclusive track written by David Probert

There is a positive message of love and unity that runs throughout the heart of Doll Set Tones music.

They try to capture the spirit of goodwill, enlightenment and friendship that in this often brutal world is sometimes hard to find. 

So it's their constant mission to give people a taste of that once whenever they catch a live show and remind them that we are all in this together!

It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007.

It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

G.U. Medicine,Saints Of Excess,2210212,0,7500777,UK,2006,0.0,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"G.U. Medicine are a tight gang of hard drinking scoundrels who also play heavy rock music very loudly and often way too fast.

Formed with the intention of getting free booze for playing music G.U. recorded their 1st L.P in 2004 released through the excellent Undergroove label. Imaginatively titled ""G.U. Medicine"", the album received rave reviews in the music press both in the U.K and Elsewhere. Other drinkers were quick to jump on the (badly driven) bandwagon and The Medicine recorded sessions for BBC Radio 1's Rock Show and Ian Camfield's XFM show.

Veterans of the road G.U have racked up countless U.K and European tours with the likes of The Wildhearts, Nick Oliveri and his Mondo Generator, My Ruin, Open Hand, Viking Skull, The Almighty, Left Side Brain and probably some more that they've forgotten about due to the beers. Picking up fans, broken-down vans and hangovers along the way.

in 2006 the band released their 2nd long player, ""Saints of Excess"" which was again hosted by the mighty Undergroove label. Again critical acclaim followed and the band recorded two videos to accompany ""A Meeting With Foul Play"" (Directed by Rod Thomas) and ""Saints of Excess"" (Filmed on tour with The Wildhearts in May/June '07). The 'Foul Play' Video won the New Blood competition on the Scuzz music channel with an amazing 48% of the viewers vote. If you want to take a squizz at these mash-ups why not take a look on the Medicine's myspace site or YouTube somewhere.

The moving hand writes. Having written, moves on. As a wise man once said. In November 2007 Medicine drummer and founding member Pete Williams left the band due to ""family commitments"". This left an empty drumstool which was quickly and very ably filled by Murray Medicine who brings fresh energy and an increased level of drumming ability!

Naaar Then! G.U Have just about polished of the last of the spirits cabinet and wrote another batch of killer riffs which is set to become the bands' 3rd (and as yet untitled) album. Due to be recorded May '08 with new producer Jason Sanderson (Errander, The Plight, Send More Paramedics, D-Rail etc) and released again through Undergroove. It promises to rock harder, darker, faster, slower and crazier than ever before. If you have a moustache please prepare for it to be blown clean off. If not, grow one quick smart!

His explorations into World music predated much of the genre's popularity. His music has spanned a number of genres, including ambient music and dance music, and in 2003, reworkings of traditional English folk songs. Though he has released recordings since the early 1980s, Wobble has been quite prolific from the mid-1990s to the present.

The music ranges from space rock guitars to ambient synthesizers. The band inject heavy riffs and fast paced synth phrases in the same vein as Psychedelic Lords OZRIC TENTACLES. The lyrics have a humorous edge in the same manner as the madcap satirical nature of Monty Python. DAY SHIFT will appeal to the psychedelic/ space rock fanbase and those who like some mirth thrown into the mix.

Strife (3),Rockin' The Boat - Live at The Nottingham Boat Club,1133387,0,13900299,UK,2006,61.6,7,['Album'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"British 1970s rock band from Liverpool.
They released two albums, ""Rush"" (1975) and ""Back to Thunder"" (1978). Strife were formed by drummer Paul Ellson in 1969 with Peter Trotman on guitar and Peter Hobbs on bass. Within a few gigs, Gordon Rowley had replaced Hobbs on bass and also became chief vocalist. Around that time, Graham Kin also joined on keyboards and vocals, leaving within a year to return to studies. In 1971, the band were joined by John Reid, ex The Klubbs, on guitar and vocals. They recorded a demo - 'Preparation' c/w 'Jerafter' as a four peice but soon after, Peter Trotman left the band and they were joined by singer Paddy Breen also ex The Klubbs. Breen's sojourn, however, was short-lived. In 1972, John Reid was badly injured whilst Stock Car racing. Peter Trotman stepped in temporarily but, at a Liverpool Club, Gordon Rowley was electrocuted and almost died on stage, being resuscitated by medics from the stunned audience. Back together again, the 3 piece recorded ""Magic of the Dawn"" a demo recording organised by US soul singer [a100591] who had seen the band at the Mardi Gras club in Liverpool. (Whist gigging nationally, Strife also often played local, Merseyside venues, sometimes playing Liverpool's Cavern Club, two or even three nights in a week). In 1973 Strife went to Los Angeles, they had an invitation to contact Mal Evans, Apple executive and former Beatles road manager. Mal Evans was working in L.A. with John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. However, the media frenzy at this get-together was so intense that, a few hours prior to the arranged meeting, the ex-Beatles and their entourage had left the city for a secret destination where they could continue their work in peace. No-one, including Strife, were told of the departure or the destination. As the band walked away from the abandoned meeting place, a pink Cadillac did a U-turn and pulled alongside. It was Edwin Starr. Through Starr they soon met up with R.Dean Taylor and recorded a demo album, both in L.A. and in San Francisco, with Taylor as producer. One of these songs, 'Better Man than I' turned up on the album 'Rush'. These sessions also resulted in the acetate 'Worry', believed to be now owned by renown Liverpool DJ, Billy Butler. Whist on a second trip to the US that year, Strife were offered a deal by the William Morris Agency to replace Grand Funk Railroad on their roster. For some reason, the band were unimpressed and returned to the UK to tour; gigs included the last night of the original Cavern Club. Strife signed with Chrysalis Records in the UK in '74 and recorded 'Rush'. It was released in early '75 with a strong appearance in the Virgin chart (at the time, the main barometer of UK rock music). As the album was released, Strife toured with Ginger Baker led outfit, The Baker Gurvitz Army. Shortly after this tour, they were joined by guitarist Vic Pappaleo but, despite Vic being an amazing guitarist, the format didn't work out. Strife continued as a three piece, working solidly and increasing their fan-base. However, despite the band's popularity, Chrysalis, whilst going through a corporate identity crisis, refused to release any further material - yet they held Strife to their contract. Regardless of the legal situation, Strife were determined to keep recording and recorded the EP 'School', releasing it on their own label, Outlaw. (Their agent, Paul King was later to take the name 'Outlaw' for his highly successful concert promotions company). After Strife eased out of the Chrysalis contract, 'School' was quickly picked up and released by EMI. For the 2nd album it was necessary to wait 3 years. Indeed ""Back To Thunder"" was released by Gull label in 1978, but in a very changed musical context (punk and disco were the masters). David Williams had replaced the resigned Paul Ellson as drummer and keyboardist Don Airey featured on some tracks. Despite the changes the album did not have any kind of feedback. In 1979 they finally disbanded."

Secondsmile,Walk In To The Light And Reach For The Sky,326729,0,5445152,UK,2006,0.0,8,['Album'],['Rock'],[],"Secondsmile was a post-hardcore band from Bridport, Dorset, UK signed to [l=Big Scary Monsters] Records. 

Beginning as a high school group in 1995, gigging the local circuit playing Silverchair and Deftones songs, after many name and member changes the band solidified its moniker and line-up in 2002 when guitarists Ross Smithwick,Thomas Warne and bassist Philip Wrixton recruited vocalist Olly Goodland and Ross' brother Fiann Smithwick and began to make a name for themselves when a two track demo CD received airplay on BBC Radio One. 

The group then signed to Big Scary Monsters records and released a 4-track EP, [r=8437539], a melodic yet aggressive bunch of tracks that earned comparisons with heavyweights [a=At The Drive-In], [a=Hopesfall] and [a=Refused]. The band began touring the UK and Europe with friends [a=Jairus], [a=Meet Me in St Louis], Make Her Cry, [a=Aconite Thrill], and [a=Sparks, Lights & Flames].

Goodland and the group parted ways after a high profile headline show at London Metro leading to guitarist Ross taking up vocal duties. Musically the group became more progressive, with longer songs and elements of post-rock seeping into the sound. First album [r=5445152] was released in 2006 to critical acclaim and propelled the group into the focus of magazines earning themselves some higher profile tour slots with [a=The Fall of Troy], [a=Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly] and [a=Planes Mistaken for Stars].

For 2008's follow-up album, [r=6237599], Secondsmile recruited Thomas Gale on guitar and keyboard duties. Recorded and produced in New York with Andrew Schneider ([a=Cave In], [a=Pelican], [a=Daughters]) and mastered by Greg Calbi ([a=Blondie], [a=David Bowie], Ramones), and featuring guest appearances from Gerard Garone (Radio Four), Oli Knowles (Meet Me in St Louis) and Dan Adams ([a=This Town Needs Guns]), the album received rave reviews across the board, expanding their sound into new territories again, likened to The Smashing Pumpkins and [a=Biffy Clyro], and leading to more intensive touring schedules, where the band shared the stage with, amongst others, [a=Rival Schools], The Blood Brothers, Daughters, Fightstar and Don Caballero. 

The band disbanded following drummer Fiann's departure in January 2009, going on hiatus for a year before eventually announcing at the end of 2009 they wouldn't be continuing. After a few years out of music, Goodland went onto to appear in rockers Minotaur Explode. Gale continued studying music, releasing the ambient Loops & Stems as Thomas James Gale, and joining electronic project Jangle. Ross Smithwick, Thomas Warne and Philip Wrixton went onto form new band Stations In The Valley."

Since that release, Red Orkestra has released 5 more full-length albums (Life with the Machines, All’s Well in Heaven and Hell, Burning Little Empires, Viva!, and Day of the Dead) and 2 EPs (Enola and Everyone Dies Alone), and has toured Europe 4 times, including headlining the Manta music festival in Portugal in 2011 and appearing at the Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg, Germany in 2012.

Although not as commercially successful as many of their contemporaries, albeit with a greater number of chart entries, Sham 69 has been a huge musical and lyrical influence on the Oi! and streetpunk genres. The band allegedly derived their name from a piece of football-related graffiti that founder Jimmy Pursey saw on a wall, which originally said Walton and Hersham '69 but had partly faded away.

They also were the first act on Manchester based imprint [l=Skam]'s SMAK sublabel.

Doherty left Seed Records to help relaunch UK techno imprint [l=B12] Records in 2006, and started a new label [l=Balkan Vinyl] in 2010.

In 2007, Doherty founded acid-focused clubnight ""I Love Acid"" along with [a=Luke Vibert] who's track it was named after, where Posthuman are resident DJs.

He was born as John Roy Anderson on 25th October 1944 in the town of Accrington, Lancashire, England, his parents being Albert and Kathleen Anderson. (He was later to drop the ""h"" from his first name.) He attended St. John's Infants School in Accrington, and made a tentative start to his musical career at an early age by playing the washboard in ""Little John's Skiffle Group"", which played songs by [a=Lonnie Donegan] among others.
Anderson left school at the age of fifteen, helping the family earn money and went through a series of jobs including working as a farm hand, a lorry driver, and a milkman.
In 1962, Anderson joined [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/411488]The Warriors[/url] (also known as The Electric Warriors), where he and his brother Tony shared the role of lead vocalist. He quit this band in 1967, released two solo singles in 1968, and then in the same year briefly sung in a band called [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/368476]The Gun[/url].
In the summer of 1968, Anderson joined a group called [a=Mabel Greer's Toyshop], which also included bassist [a=Chris Squire] and guitarist [a=Peter Banks]. Anderson fronted this band, but ended up leaving again before the summer was over. Anderson, Squire, and Banks went on to form [a=Yes], with drummer [a=Bill Bruford] and keyboardist [a=Tony Kaye]. Their debut album was released in 1969. Jon Andersons' distinctive voice and singing formed the bands sound and remains as one of the major characteristics.

His daughters are [a=Deborah Anderson] & [a=Jade Anderson].

Originally formed as an opportunity to play their shared passion of the Border, Tex-Mex and Americana music that the members of the band love, they started as a practice band playing when other musical commitments allowed- top musicians just playing for fun. Word got around as word does and soon the band started playing gigs. At least one member of this highly respected group will be very familiar. Los Pacaminos is fronted by one of the UK's finest and best loved vocalists - Paul Young. However, Paul is not the only luminary in this seven piece band. Some of the best musicians in the business have teamed up to present an incendiary mix of classics and original material.

Paul says - ""Los Pacaminos started out just for fun, playing simply for the pleasure of it, and it just took off from there. What's really nice is that everyone else in the band can sing too, and they do, all in their own different styles. It's real bar room stuff, foot stompers, not too many slow songs - a real party atmosphere.""

Tex-Mex music is somewhere between the Mariachi and Norteno styles of Mexico and the Country/Blues sounds of South-West America. The band empathises with Ry Cooder, Flaco Jimenez, The Texas Tornados and Los Lobos. Mix that together with blues, rock 'n' roll and a hint of South American music and you have Los Pacaminos. Their set includes songs like 'Wooly Bully', 'La Bamba' and sometimes, if enough tequila is flowing, even 'Speedy Gonzales'. The Band members are some of the best known names in the music industry, from a variety of backgrounds. They've covered all kinds of music, but the unifying factor is that they all have played in Paul Young's bands through the 80's and 90's. Their friendships stretch back 20 to 30 years, and it's these long term connections that underpin the very special atmosphere generated at a Los Pacaminos show. Members of the audience are often invited onstage to join the guys in a slug of Tequila.

They were joined by Eric on electric viola and later by Shanks on congas. The band continued to play the free festivals. In 1981, Rob returned on drums with Twink and Maz on synths and this was the start of Karmakanix.
In 2001 Steve was introduced to Mike Howlett through producer John Leckie, and after a jam at Mike’s birthday party, House of Thandoy emerged, they were later joined by drummer Eddy Sayer, and made one album which features Theo Travis on flute and sax.

There were five members upfront with sung and spoken vocals, guitars, harmonica, fretless bass, synths and a knackered old PC and CRT monitor playing old house loops and spoken word samples. They pumped out a heavy diet of industrial beats.  In a music scene dominated by rock, punk and ska, bonemachine confused everyone.

The band have shared stages with a range of artists from 65 Days Of Static, Lo Fidelity Allstars, The Mission, Sigue Sigue Sputnik and The Damage Manual. During early live shows they sold unique self-made cds at every gig, each with its own artwork, track versions and mixes. This constant graft eventually reached the ears of the short lived cult independent record company Hackpen Records, who signed them in 2004.

Their first official album ‘Vent’ was released on Hackpen in 2004, and received positive reviews from press (Guardian, Drowned in Sound, Logo, Rant etc.) They continued to build their reputation of as a strong live act, supported by an eclectic backdrop of videos, including slowmo space launches, nighttime cityscapes, looped 50’s showreels and Will Hay films, all overlaid by lyrics, statements or comments received from press or fans. The first single, ‘Another Day Over’, was released by Hackpen followed by a remix by cult 80’s band Sigue Sigue Sputnik (aided by DJ Simon Heartfield) on Oxford’s Shifty Disco record label.

After the release of their second album ‘Why Can’t We Catch The Liars’ on Hackpen Records in 2006, bonemachine began an extended period of ‘doing something else’, which meant occasionally releasing tracks and playing live with side projects such as Music to Drive Tanks To. 

The tug of the original idea proved too strong though and original members Graves, Ost and Barrett recruited the fresh voice of Rendle - this eponymous new album is the result. "

The band had temporary changed its name twice, in 1984 to [a=Blind Fury (3)] and in 1988 to [a=Pariah (6)]. The name Satan was used from 1979 to 1984, from 1985 to 1988, in 2004 and since 2011. The band was part of the NWOBHM movement.

The band was formed in 1979 by guitarists Steve Ramsey and Russ Tippins.  They are considered part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement.  After several line up changes, the band (including Ramsey, Tippins, bassist Graeme English, drummer Sean Taylor, and vocalist Brian Ross) recorded the band's first LP, 1983's ""Court in the Act"".  Following the release of the record, and finding themselves disagreeing over the direction of the band, Satan parted ways with Ross and replaced him with Lou Taylor, who had briefly been part of Satan in 1982.  Feeling the name Satan was limiting the band and not wanting be associated with the connotations that came with it, the band adopted the name of the act that Lou Taylor had been previously working with, Blind Fury.  Blind Fury released one LP in 1985.  The rest of the band parted ways with Lou Taylor following the release, replacing him with vocalist Michael Jackson and reverting to the Satan moniker.  This version of Satan released the LP ""Suspended Sentence"" in 1987.  In 1988, they rebranded as Pariah, retaining the same line up and releasing two albums before splitting in 1990.  Ramsey, Tippins, and English relaunched Pariah in 1997 with a new drummer (Ian McCormack, who had been Sean Taylor's predecessor in Satan) and vocalist.  They released one album but broke up in 1998.  In 2004, Ramsey, Tippins, English, and Brian Ross regrouped for an appearance at the Wacken Open Air Festival (Sean Taylor was suffering an injury and unable to perform).  The full ""Court in the Act"" line up permanently reunited in 2011 to tour and record."

King Crimson,"April 15, 1971 - Zoom Club, Frankfurt, Germany",70828,0,3960861,UK,2006,42.0,5,"['FLAC', 'Album', 'Club Edition']",['Rock'],['Prog Rock'],"were an English-based progressive rock band formed in 1968. One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer). In 2016 [a=Jeremy Stacey] (drums, keyboards) joined as an eighth member making the group a ""double quartet"".

The band toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Levin and Jakszyk had earlier said that the North America tour was probably the band's last there."

The band was formed on the 06/06/06 and that fact was often used in their albums marketing.

They released their final album in 2012, ""Return To Rye"", which was like a six year anniversary album and featured re-imaginings of their most classic tracks. It was around this time that Taurean J joined the group but no recording was ever completed. Since then, the RTC have been on and off active up until 2016 when they tried to reform with a new lineup of Memorex, HatchetHead, Taurean J and Juztin Sane, but it fell through.

A year later, they released their first single, ""Großstadtindianer"" on [a=Alfred Hilsberg]'s [l=Zickzack] label. The band also contributed the track ""Kälbermarsch"" to the label compilation ""Lieber Zuviel Als Zuwenig."" Around this time, Bassist Rita Simon was replaced by Wolfgang Ellerbrock. In 1982, the band released the classic ""Incubus Succubus"". That same year, Drummer Caro May was replaced by Manuela Zwingmann.

While German audiences were less than receptive at first, a UK tour opening for [a=Cocteau Twins] resulted in a label deal with 4AD Records. Their debut album ""Fetisch"" (1983) and the singles ""Qual"" and ""Incubus Succubus II"" all made the UK Independent charts, even though the band used German lyrics. Manuela Zwingmann left the band one year later, replaced by Peter Bellendir. This lineup proved to be the longest-running. 1984 saw the release of the album Tocsin, followed by a world tour through to 1985. 1986 saw the release of ""Matador,"" produced by [a=Hugh Cornwell] of [a=The Stranglers]. Xmal Deutschland also opened for The Stranglers at a concert at Wembley Arena in London. Their follow-up album, ""Viva,"" was recorded in Hamburg and was released in 1987, followed by the single ""Sickle Moon"".

After the release of ""Viva,"" Manuela Rickers, Fiona Sangster, and Peter Bellendir left the group. Anja Huwe and Wolfgang Ellerbrock continued to work with Frank Z. Abwärts on Guitar. Producer Henry Staroste played Keyboards, and German studio Drummer Curt Cress completed the lineup that would record the 1989 LP ""Devils"" and the singles ""Dreamhouse"" and ""I'll Be Near You."" The LP showed a change of direction towards mainstream pop, and this proved to be the last release from X Mal Deutschland, 1990 saw a few scattered live appearances, though the group soon split up."

Started by Richard Johnson (aka Richo, also of Fourth Dimension Records and Lumberton Trading Company, plus Adverse Effect writer and editor/publisher of Grim Humour), Stuart Carter (Scalpt, Heroin, The Fields of Hay) and Hassni Malik (The Vitamin B12, dROME), it originally set out to break away from Splintered's 'rock' trappings whilst still focusing on textures, drones, abstract sounds, etc. also to be found in them. The first album, On Parallel Shores Removed, took a couple of years to fall into place, but even then ultimately amounted to Theme struggling to find their feet in slightly new and different settings (that included drafting in female vocalists and noise guitar elements). Work on the second album, Our Angels Dislocated, took another few years to come together and was not ready to release until 2006. Far more focussed than the predecessor, it saw the group stripped down to its core trio and emphasising the often filmic yet forever organic textures much further. Vocals were sparse and buried, plus the presence of instruments such as sitar, singing bowls and piano helped drive things along. A third album by the group, Valentine (Lost) Forever, appeared in August 2009 on Israel's HCB Recordings. On this, Hassni was replaced by Jeanne Boyer on a few songs, plus the material itself is denser and owes more to Richo and Stuart's past concerns with the outer realms of psychedelia, noise and industrial music. There's also stronger focus on vocals, which are often cut-up, treated and looped. Steven Severin (ex-Siouxsie & the Banshees) also contributes a remix to this album.

Along the way, Theme have also contributed to a couple of compilations, plus have played a handful of sporadic shows throughout Europe, and collaborated with Faust's Jean-herve Peron and Budapest's Zsolt Sores. 

They continue to remain a nucleus of Richo and Stuart, but are sometimes given to working with others both live and on their recordings. Collaborators have also included Olga Drenda, Hayden Berry, Lukasz Kozak, Zsolt Varga, Tomek Choloniewski and others. During more recent years, their sound has becoming increasingly aggressive and intense. but are sometimes given to working with others both live and on their recordings.

The band consists of Matthew Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, piano), Christopher Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums, backing vocals). Dan Lancaster joins Muse on live stage since 2022 (previously Morgan Nicholls) for additional instruments and vocals.

Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as ""Butterflies & Hurricanes"", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.

Black Holes & Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as ""Supermassive Black Hole"". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009), loosely based on the novel 1984, and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, was released on November 9th, 2018. Will of the People, their latest to date album, was released on August 26th, 2022 and is inspired by the current years events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, riots, Black Lives Matter movement, and so on.

Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].
The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.
In 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).
They were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.
However, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.

These people are involved in a number of ways, some are dancers, choral singers, horns, orchestral instruments, visual artists (electro and organic). Each performance takes on a life of its own keeping its form nonetheless because the core group remains stable. There is a good deal of improvisation but also well orchestrated planned ideas and great songs of newness.

DORKESTRA
Sometimes dufus will play with a number of orchestral instruments including violin, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, saxophone, tuba, piano, flute, oboe, bassoon, percussion, etc.

DOOFAMILY
The Doofamily is made up of previous members of the band and others who are at times invited to be a part of the shows.

“Intense, passionate vocals and a clear grasp of how to write a great song – mesmerising….”
Pete Christie has been compared to many acclaimed musicians from Martin Simpson to Paul Weller, and was recently described as being “a cross between Pete Townsend, Mark Knopfler and Richard Thompson, but with a great voice; though, until now, without the fame !!!”
Pete Christie has developed his own original powerful style of acoustic fingerstyle guitar technique. His songs, and importantly, his lyrics are original English and contemporised anglicana roots, with a mix of rock, folk and country. His individualistic fingerstyle guitar technique can coax anything from achingly beautiful simple, sparse, and haunting accompaniment, to an explosive, almost neo-flamenco rhythm. It’s as if Pete “duets” with the guitar rather than just casually strums it, and he has perfected the art of making it sound like there has got to be more than just one musician on stage.
Over his 40 years as a performing musician, Pete has been frontman in a three-piece rock band, a professional songwriter, a recording sessions singer, and has been a guest with a diverse array of guitarists and musicians such as:
 Jackie Leven, Nick Harper, Jeff Lang, Glenn Tillbrook, Ezio, Ruby Turner, Hugh Cornwell, Bob Brozman, Martin Harley, Matt Andersen, Ben Montague, Kieran Halpin, Ron Trueman-Border, Steve Tilston, Rory Ellis, Dave Pegg, and frequently with Derrin Nauendorf.
Pete is based on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset in southern UK and is touring with his latest studio album ‘Frank’, which shows off his gift for tethering his romantic ruminations to memorable melodies and instrumental harmonies. The album has been called “refreshing”, “honest”, “wonderful”, “a great British singer songwriter”, “natural”, “versatile”, “…heartfelt songs that recall McTell’s glory days…”, and “delivered by a master craftsman”. “Frank is not background music. It’s a wonderfully written book brought to life by sounds”.
“Waiting in the Wings” one of Pete’s most frequently requested songs, is, according to Minor 7th in the USA: “….reminiscent of the off-the-wall stuff of Brian Wilson and Sir Paul as produced by Sir George Martin.”
In 2011, Pete joined forces with the UK Roots Movement alongside Wille and the Bandits, Alex Roberts, Rory Ellis, Andy Grant, The Wishbones, and Hip Route. Artists of integrity who share the true philosophy of the troubadour and offer promoters and proprietors a stable of artists of proven quality and reliability. Occasionally we even get to perform together, like at UK Roots Movement Folk On The Quay festival in 2013

 
In 2013, Pete Christie, Nicky Swann and Jinder came together to form Westcountry Songwriters Circle. Three accomplished and distinctive singer songwriters, on stage in a brand-new collaboration, add the audience, and the magic commences. We take the BBC4 Songwriters Circle format to a whole new level. Music performance is our passion and inspiration. We do it, to do it. We are always on tour and yes, we make a living. After years of honing our songs, practicing for hours, and reflecting upon how they work in a concert environment, our music now appeals on a variety of levels – intellectual, emotional and spiritual, with a good balance between familiarity and variety. Live music can give the audience moments beyond the price tag. We take the audience on a journey through lyrics and melodies. It is all about the audience and crowd interaction, being comfortable and spontaneous onstage and an exceptionally high quality of sound. The signature song for Westcountry Songwriters Circle is ’Westcountry Love Song’, with three-part vocal harmony, melodies and a capella performed at our first event together for Kontra Roots at Finedon Community Centre, in Northampton.
Pete Christie is passionate about his handmade guitars and the quality of sound he produces, and is proud to be a “Featured Artist” for Avalon Guitars.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

After nearly 60 years of marriage, his wife, Lady Melinda Rose Woodward passed away in April, 2016."

The Kazoo Funk Orchestra formed in Scotland at the end of 2005 as a pre-apocalyptic merry-go-round collective, featuring musicians, anti-poets, dancers and finger painters. Building their melodies at a DIY project studio in producer Ray McCartney’s living room, the band exchanged influences and took inspiration from various genres to create their eclectic mix-tape sound.

In May 2006, the band released their 25-track debut album, Midnight Finger Painter, in which the first 500 copies included a unique finger painting created by fans and band members. The album featured the infectious indie ditty, Baby You’ve No Eyes and psychedelic folk-hop track, Disco Disco Disco Theque.

The release of Midnight Finger Painter was followed by a handful of local gigs and then it was back into the studio for more recording sessions. Adventures in Fuzzy Felt Land, was released as a 13-track EP in January 2007, featuring the b-soul tinged, Did You Ever Get that Balloon I Sent You and sexy pop ditty, Dirty Dinners.

In the summer of 2007, the collective packed themselves into a couple of wagons and took on their first UK tour including a couple festival dates. In an explosion of balloons and confetti, they turned each gig into a party inviting the crowd to join in on the fun. And with standing room only outside the Solus tent at the Wickerman Festival, the band secured the closing slot at the 2008 Wickerman Festival.

During the frosty winter months of 2007-2008, the band hit the studio and gave birth to This Album is Self Titled, their second full-length album. The collection of melodies that make up the 50-track album, include Robots in Your Eyes, Battery Powered Radio, and the enchanting Carnivale. Initially released as a limited edition CD in July 2008, with a crayon in the spine and a colouring book as the insert, then later released as a digital download.

The collective then took their show on the road once again, stopping at various festivals and live venues along the way. And with the addition of 6 new members to the band, not to mention more balloons, tinfoil and confetti than ever before, the live show became an experience not to be missed.

Shortly after the band finished their tour, the BBC invited them up to Stornoway to record a live session for BBC Rapal. The session was aired on BBC Alba in January 2009.

Previous members include: El Baterista, Blunder, Grum, Jim 'n' Tonic, Nunny Boy and Krash Slaughta."

The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005) Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981) Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, and chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). 

Depeche Mode released their debut record ""Speak & Spell,"" in 1981, bringing them into the British new-wave scene. Soon after the release of the album, Clarke decided to quit the band, leaving them to record their next album, 1982's ""A Broken Frame,"" as a trio. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, thus establishing a line-up that would continue for the next thirteen years.

1983's groundbreaking ""Construction Time Again,"" and 1984's ""Some Great Reward,"" gained the band extensive popularity in the US. The subsequent releases of 1986's ""Black Celebration,"" and 1987's ""Music for the Masses,"" established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, titled ""101,"" where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. The latter end of the US tour was recorded and released on VHS video, and was titled ""101."" The show itself was recorded and released as a double live album, and carried the same title.

In the new decade, Depeche Mode released 1990's ""Violator,"" which was a massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, 1993's ""Songs of Faith and Devotion,"" and the supporting ""Devotional Tour,"" exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. 

Now a trio once again, the band released ""Ultra,"" in 1997. This album was recorded during the height of Dave Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Martin Gore's alcoholism and seizures, along with Andrew Fletcher's bout with serious depression. For these reasons, there was no worldwide tour for this album. In 1998, the band released ""The Singles 81 > 85,"" which was a re-issue of 1985's ""The Singles 81 → 85."" The latter release contained ""Photographic (Some Bizarre Version)"" & ""Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Remix).""

They also released ""The Singles 86>98,"" and there was a subsequent world tour, titled ""The Singles Tour."" 

The release of 2001's ""Exciter,"" confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful. The ""Exciter Tour,"" was their first tour in support of an original album since 1993. Again, the band did tour in 1998 to support the aforementioned ""The Singles 86–98,"" compilation albums.

Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have to this day sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the world's best-selling music artists. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode ""the most popular electronic band the world has ever known,"" and included the band in the list of the ""50 Bands That Changed the World!"" Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time.""

While at least 8 members concentrate on drums and voice, producing primal, interlocking rounds and rhythms, the band augments their sound with an ever-growing array of guitars, violins, bowed saws, sheet metal and singing tubes.

Since their inception in June 2005, Leopard Leg's ever-evolving, all-consuming live show has illuminated stages across the land, on tour with Liars and supporting such greats as Afrirampo, Wolf Eyes, Asva, Burning Star Core and Prurient.

Their 1988 debut [i]Life's Too Good[/i] attracted terrific reviews and became a college radio hit, but they never were able to recapture that sense of excitement.

According to group legend, the Sugarcubes formed on June 8, 1986, the day that vocalist [a1373] gave birth to her son. Prior to that day, the members of the group had been in a variety of Icelandic bands. Björk had the longest career out of any of the members. By 1984, Björk, Einar Örn Benediktsson and Siggi Baldursson had joined forces, forming [a=KUKL] with keyboardist Einar Melax. KUKL — which means witchcraft in Icelandic — was a noisy, artsy, post-punk band that released two albums on the independent British record label Crass. In 1986, KUKL evolved into the Sugarcubes, adding Björk's then-husband Thor Eldon on guitar and Bragi Ólafsson on bass. 

In late 1987, the band signed to One Little Indian in the U.K., Elektra Records in the U.S. The Sugarcubes released their debut album [i]Life's Too Good[/i] in 1988 to critical acclaim in both the U.K. and the U.S. [i]Birthday[/i], the first single from the album, became an indie hit in Britain and a college radio hit in America. In particular, Björk received a heap of praise, which began tensions between her and Einar Örn. 

[i]Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week![/i], the Sugarcubes' second album, was released in 1989. The album featured a greater vocal contribution by Einar, which was criticized in many of the record's reviews, which were noticably weaker than those for [i]Life's Too Good[/i]. After the release of [i]Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week![/i], the band embarked on a lengthy international tour.  At the conclusion of the tour in late 1990, the band members pursued their own individual interests. 

[i]Stick Around for Joy[/i], the band's third album, was released in 1992. Before the record appeared, a collection of remixes called [i]It's It[/i] was released in Europe. [i]Stick Around for Joy[/i] received better reviews than [i]Life's Too Good[/i], but the album failed to yield a hit single.  Following its release, the Sugarcubes disbanded.  In 1993, Björk launched a critically acclaimed and commercially successful solo career that was based in dance music.

Brothers Hugh (vocals, rhythm) and Norm (drums) had previously played in a mod rock band called The Cinnamon Firm which had recently broke up after several line up changes. The Firm were a popular live act in Ireland and had enjoyed a few local tv appearances and attracted interest from a couple of major record labels. At the same time Norm was also playing drums for a loud dirty garage rock and roll band called Thee Dreggs. Thee Dreggs vocalist and rhythm guitarist had recently left the band to set up home in Belgium. The members of the Cinnamon Firm and Thee Dreggs had been friends for years so it seemed like a natural solution to invite Hugh to get together with remaining Dreggs - Bobby (lead guitar), Will (Bass, Vocals) and Norm to form a new band. The merger brought Hugh's mod songwriting sensibilities together with raw rootsy garage band ethics. The new band was called THE KEEPERS. They managed to retain the essence and power of their old bands but with an added dynamic that gives them their own distinct brand of Belfast beat. it wasn't long before they had written a handful of songs. They recorded the tracks straight away while they were still fresh and vibrant to their ears, a philosophy they have continued through all their recordings. On May 24th of that year, the band played their first gig to a great response in front of 200 people at Belfast's Limelight club and have since been playing regularly around Northern Ireland and other places such as England, Rep of Ireland, Isle of Man, Holland, Belgium and Germany.

Their sound is ingrained with elements of garage rock, RandB, mod and punk but refuses to be pigeon-holed into any of these genres. The music is like a hit from an injected drug - instant, colourful, direct, loud, highly addictive rock 'n' roll that will mainline straight to your soul. Sick and tired of an endless slew of pop and shoe-gazing indie bands the Keepers are hitting back with raw ballsy rockin' tunes, Big ol' hairy monkey balls baby! But this is not protest music. These boys don't waste time protesting, this is DIRECT ACTION!

The Keepers' set is comprised mostly of well-crafted original material with a helping of cool covers of some of their favourite songs. Their hair-raising live reputation helped them land a weekly residency and their own club night (Balloon Farm) in Belfast's Duke of York bar, a savvy mixture of live rock 'n' roll and hip vinyl sounds which they ran for several months.

Their first single - 'Stop Pretending' was released in early 2001 and is available on seven inch vinyl from Barcelona's Butterfly Records label. The band have also released a five track CD on Italy's AUA Records as well as two self-released CD albums. Tracks by the Keepers are also available on compilation albums from labels such As El Torro and No Action.

So there you have it, good 'ol rock 'n' roll is alive and well in Belfast and these boys are the keepers of the faith. So, seek ye The Keepers and prepare for heaven!! "

They begun to rehearsing, before in the cottage of Roger Daltrey (Ellis good friend) and then in the studio of Mitch Mitchell (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Eventually, the band recorded his debut album ""Riding On The Crest Of A Slump"", at Olympic Studios in West London, with Daltrey as the producer. After the release of the album in 1972, the bassist Jim Leverton quit and was replaced by Nick South from the prog act Second Hand. For the 2nd album, the band went for Mike Vernon (of record label Blue Horizon fame) as the producer of choice. It was mostly recorded at Morgan Studios in London and also at Olympic. At the recordings featured friendly various musicians such as Boz Burrell (King Crimson, Bad Company), Julie Tippetts, Maggie Nicols, Mike Patto, Roger Chapman (Family) and Colin Allen (Stone The Crows). The album, called ""Why Not?"", was issued in 1973 but it wasn't the success the band hoped for. So, after some gigs on the university circuit, the group broke-up."
