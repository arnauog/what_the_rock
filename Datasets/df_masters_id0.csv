The wall of noise produced by the band encompasses very untraditional drums sound supplied in the form of distorted 909 kick drums, and industrial sound scapes with general destructive elements used to enhance sonic assault. With twin vocal attacks and machine gun vocals rhythms the band stop at nothing to express their hatred on humanity. 

The Berzerker was created as a solo studio project in 1995 and went on to release various EP's on labels such as 
Industrial Strength (USA), Speedcore (GERMANY)and Widerstand (AUSTRIA). 1998 saw the initial contact with Earache Records (UK) with the re-mixes of the Morbid Angel tracks Day of Suffering, Abominations and The Ancient Ones. 
The Berzerker was offered a contract with Earache Records for a number of full-length albums shortly afterwards, 
and in 2000 the Self-Titled album was released and the live act was born. 

The bands first film clip for the track ""Reality"" was banned by the ITC (independent television commission) and MTV due to excessive strobe lighting and horrific images, including the appearance of the band. 

In early 2001 the band headed off on a successful 27 show tour of the USA and Canada.

And in 2002/03 the band embarked on a World Tour to support their album Dissimulate this saw over 100 shows played across Australia, USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and many more. They did full month long tours with bands such as toured with such bands as Nile, Napalm Death, Strapping Young Lad, Vader, Immolation and many more...

From the official website:
------------------------------------
Darkflight started in the year 2000, creating a mix of blackened doom metal with fantasy influenced lyrics. In the beginning of 2002, the debut demo ""Obscure"" was completed, with the demo's concept inspired by Adam Nichols's fantasy book, ""The War Of The Lords Veil"". The label Totentroll (Rage of Achilles subsidiary), who specialized in releasing 7"" vinyls of fantasy metal, proposed to release two of the demo tracks as an EP single called ""Alone Somewhere Beyond"". Meanwhile, Darkflight recorded the album ""Under The Shadow Of Fear"" and attracted the attention of the main label. They both decided to focus on releasing a full length and the 7"" EP single was cancelled. The band signed a 2 album record deal, and the album was released on June 30th, 2003.

Darkflight started recordings for the next album called ""The Northern Campaign"". In the middle of 2004, Rage of Achilles announced that it would cease to exist due to financial problems. The band used some of the unfinished album tracks and released an online Promo, while searching for a new label.

A few labels contacted the band during that time and while Darkflight didn't have enough material for a second full length, they decided to join in a split album with another band. Together, Oak Knoll Productions and Konklav Records planned a split release with the French band Ars Moriendi. Unfortunately, Oak Knoll Productions couldn't handle the manufacturing costs, as well as having very serious financial problems, resulting in the canceling of the CD.

During 2007 year the band released the 3rd demo called ""Distant Pain"" and immediately caught the attention of the US based label Ars Magna Recordings. Recording sessions took place in the winter of 2007 and the second full length album named ""Perfectly Calm"" was completed, containing some new songs, the ""Distant Pain"" demo and two of the tracks from the unreleased split album. The album was released on the 6th of June 2008 and contains 8 tracks of nearly 60 minutes of playing time. Currently the band is working on a new full length album with the temporary title ""Closure"".

Jon Gomm,Hypertension,1216628.0,,3642829,UK,2003,57.47,11,['Album'],"['Rock', 'Pop']",['Acoustic'],"Jon Gomm is an acoustic singer-songwriter with an incredible virtuoso guitar style, where he uses one acoustic guitar to create drum sounds, basslines and sparkling melodies all at the same time, and combining styles from blues and jazz to rock and pop. The emphasis is still on the soulful vocals and songwriting however, and his original material is influenced by everything from Robert Johnson to Radiohead.

Jon first laid his hands on a guitar at the age of two (actually it was a ukulele - his parents couldn’t find a guitar small enough). He started taking classical guitar lessons, wrote his first song at the age of six, and at twelve he was accompanying his father, a music critic, to blues gigs in his hometown of Blackpool. Touring musicians would often stay at the Gomm household on the understanding Jon would get a guitar lesson, meaning he had one-to-one instruction from such legends as Walter Trout, Bob Brozman, Sherman Robertson and Norman Beaker (Jack Bruce band).

On leaving school Jon turned down a place at Oxford University to attend The Guitar Institute in London. While there he paid his way through college playing jazz in café-bars, recording as a session guitarist, and even playing Country & Western in working mens clubs for line-dancers.

Eventually he heard the call of the north and moved to Leeds, where he is now based, to study on the Jazz degree course at the music college there. He decided to try his hand at performing solo, and discovered all kinds of new sounds he could make with an acoustic guitar – hitting the surface of it to make snare drum, bass drum and bongo sounds, re-tuning the strings to get bass sounds, and teasing high harmonics from the guitar for synthesizer-like effects. He worked all these techniques into his own songs, and put his years of singing blues into use.

Nowadays he tours Europe, playing at festivals from Rome to Athens, has a huge cult following and is regarded by those in the know as one of the world’s most talented and innovative acoustic guitarists. Even with only one CD so far released he is already cited as an influence by many other performers. His videos are watched thousands of times within days of appearing on Youtube, and his home-recorded CD “Hypertension” has sold over ten thousand copies with no industry backing.

traditional way by playing covers in rough-neck South London pubs.
As he honed his distinctive take on acoustic/indie/rock, he introduced
more of his own songs into the live sets - gradually edging out the
covers to develop a recognisable voice of his own.

Lyrically compelling, he writes not just with wit but with the
honesty of experience - Last Six Strings in particular is a
song I defy any Londoner not to recognise a piece of him
or herself in. Perhaps that is the key to why his songs
really hit home: from the simple, pared-down beauty of
Sophie to the embitteredly anthemic Green Eyes and
Losing Me; they recall emotions as universal as they are
deeply personal.

It is this same rawness of emotion which characterises Ben's live sets.
The years of hard work since those early covers gigs combined with
his passionate and engaging live performance show that although still
occasionally (and delightfully) rough around the edges, Ben clearly
has the talent and the drive to become one of London's finest ever
singer/songwriters.

Dear Everyone,

Right, I've been putting this off for ages...
writing about myself on the website, but
then I thought, well I sing about myself
enough and go on about myself constantly,
so why buck the trend? So here we go;

I was never likely to be good at this
songwriting stuff, because as a teenager
listening almost exclusively to sixties pop
and nineties rock, I didn't really want to do
anything 'new' - there was just a few great
people I wanted to be like. After playing in
pubs, bars, cafe's, at brother-in-law's
birthdays etc... I realized that I was just
doing a bad impression of a sort of
Lennon/Springstein/Gallagher/Baez morph
(don't ask). Wake-up call. Either join a
cover's band and start earning some decent
money or start writing about what I know.
Which I then realized wasn't very much. So I
started writing what I think. Which is
marginally more. 

Don't get me wrong, I think there is a something to be said for just getting on stage and
singing rock and roll songs and looking cool and getting the girls, but that's not all there is.
Actually getting up and doing something that's totally your own is something that has struck
me as being more interesting recently - which also helps you get the girls.

It's a long road, and maybe one without an end, to getting to thinking yeah that's what I
wanted to write, and it's original, but things are moving along nicely.

Having regular gigs at relaxed and intimate venues has let me mess about with stuff (new
songs old songs, friendly (sometimes not so friendly) banter) and developing the on stage
version of me in general.

The bigger gigs are starting to follow in behind one another and there is some really nice
support slots coming up, which is always useful. If you've been to a gig and like what you've
seen/heard please sign up to the mailing list and come again.

Thanks for reading - I'm off to the toilet now to be sick.

Love

Ben

The group recorded six albums in the seventies, the opening trio of which were on John Peel's Dandelion label. Fiddler & Hope Evans formed Medicine Head in 1969. At the end of 1971, Peter left for about nine months and John continued the band with John Davis on drums and [a445544] on bass guitar. They left when Peter returned in the summer of 1972 and the band once again became a duo. It came off the road in October 1973 while Peter and John recruited three more musicians.

Medicine Head switched from [l38282] to Polydor as Hope-Evans returned for the album One & One Is One, recorded with various session musicians. The title track became the band's biggest hit, reaching no.3 in the UK in 1973, and they followed it up with Rising Sun (no. 11). For the next album Thru' A Five, the duo were augmented on a regular basis by [a287213] of Family on drums, [a287216] on guitar, and [a426498] on bass. The album featured the Slim Harpo-influenced song Slip and Slide which became the band's final hit, reaching no.22 in the UK in 1974. Despite consistent touring, often as a supporting act, Medicine Head failed to place an album on the UK Albums Chart. For their final album Two Man Band, recorded at Pete Townshend's Eel Pie Studios, they reverted to being a duo.

Medicine Head finally folded in 1977. In 2005, Angel Air released the album Don't Stop The Dance, a 'lost' album, compiling some singles from an unsuccessful period with [l33191] and some unreleased sessions of the band as a five piece. John Fiddler released solo albums after the breakup of the band but revived the Medicine Head name for Fiddlersophical in 2011. In 2020 Cherry Red released a 50th Anniversary edition of the New Bottles Old Medicine debut with a second disc of singles, sessions & live material spanning the 1970-1975 period."

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

After initial rehersals T & Latouche were born…… The debut album 'Tales from an urban safari' has a reggae sound shot through with flavours of other musical generes, notably Afrobeat, Arabic, Calypso and Ska. Imagine yourself walking down Claremont Road in Moss Side or Brixton and overhearing conversations whilst music drifts past. Songs feature tales of underground parties, political frustrations, drug busts, love, hope and frustration…"

Far from being a Class of 2000 alt.pop supergroup (Fierce Panda contingent), Skandinavia are actually embracers of Rawk Music and duly have the riffery to prove it. New single 'Never Too Late' comes on like a slab of early ‘90s power metal, with layered wailing vocals, soaring violin and thumping bass, but without the ‘ironic’ factor that could have them labelled as a typical ‘post-Darkness’ band (even though Dan Hawkins once played guitar for them). Meanwhile B-side 'Storm' is reminiscent of 'Pablo Honey'-era Radiohead given more oomph, dusted with string accompaniment and replacing Thom for PJ Harvey. Plus the lyrical content is said to concern Nordic mythology, which is a far cry from singing about Star Wars fanatics and wetting yourself in front of potential boyfriends. Stormy, mystical and highly enjoyable Iceland rock it is, then.

The Handsome Beasts,04,1190249,,8310914,UK,2004,47.93,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"The Handsome Beasts is a heavy metal band from Nuneaton, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, that was formed in 1972. The band was part of the NWOBHM movement.

Fronted by singer Garry Dalloway (nick-named ""the original fat bastard"" by the Kerrang! Direktory Of Heavy Metal), they quickly became local heroes. 

Paul Birch, who rated the band very highly, tried to get them a record deal asking numerous major labels if they would be interested. They weren't, so he founded his own label, [l=Heavy Metal Records], to release the first Handsome Beasts EP, ""All Riot Now"" in 1980. 

In 1981 ""Breaker"" EP was released again by [l=Heavy Metal Records]. In this EP the 'digital spiral technique' was used, it played ""Crazy"" or ""One In A Crowd"" depending on where you put the record needle at the beginning, a gimmick later used by [a=Kiss]. A little later, ""Sweeties"" EP was also released by [l=Heavy Metal Records].

Dalloway, bassist Steve Hough, guitarist Phil Aston and drummer Pete Malbasa played further gigs in the midlands area before recording their debut LP ""Beastiality"" in 1981 and in the same time Aston was replaced by Paul Robins. With an outrageous but humorous cover, the album showed that musically Handsome Beasts still incorporated massive blues influences into their heavy metal sound. The album featured only four new songs, ""David's Song"", ""Another Day"", ""Tearing Me Apart"" and ""High Speed"" as the rest of the material was previously released in their EP's. 

When in the middle of the 80's, N.W.O.B.H.M. started to fade-out, it was time for Handsome Beasts to call it quits.

However in 1990 Garry reformed the band with guitarist Maz Matrenko, Ray Richman on drums and they released ""The Beasts Within"" album. Another album was recorded during the 90’s entitled ""Little Sister"" but was never released.

In 2004 the band released the ""04"" album with a new line-up of Garry (vocals), Ray Richman (drums), Alan Nyland (guitar), Mark Boreland (guitar) and Sean Brennan (bass).

In 2005 Ray Richman left and was replaced on drums by Mick Roobottom.

Unfortunately Garry passed away in August 2005 due to a heart attack, only shortly after recording another album. There were thoughts by the rest of the members about the band's future, but they remembered Garry saying 18 months earlier and while watching the front-man Simon Hall of Beholder, a local covers band: 'when I peg it, that's the guy you want'. 

Shortly after Garry's death, the band indeed asked Simon if he would like to sing in some gigs in the memory of Garry. These gigs went quite well and the band decided that Garry was right after all, Simon was the right guy and so they asked him to join the band permanently. 

Garry's last album was finally released in June 2007, entitled ""Rock And A Hard Place"".

Simon left the band in late 2007 and was shortly followed by Si Fielding (a bass player from Beholder who joined Handsome Beasts in the summer of 2007).

In December 2007 the band found a new front-man, Rocky Shades. He was the singer from the legendary [a=Wrathchild], a band with whom Handsome Beasts were mates back in the [l=Heavy Metal Records] days. Besides the new vocalist, a new bass player joined, Shawn Till, a friend of Mick's who for the last couple of years had been fronting a [a=Motörhead] tribute band called Motörkill.

Currently Handsome Beasts are still active, playing some gigs and preparing material for a new LP, however no original member is left in their ranks.

Rob ""Rocky Shades"" Berkley - vocals

Alan Nyland - guitar

Rose Kemp,Mini–Album,573543,,2961520,UK,2004,0.0,7,['Mini-Album'],['Rock'],"['Folk Rock', 'Indie Rock']","Rose Kemp (born 11 December 1984) is an English singer, songwriter and guitarist whose work has moved from acoustic folk to doom metal. As the daughter of [a=Maddy Prior] and [a=Rick Kemp] from [a=Steeleye Span] (with whom she sang live while still a teenager), it is perhaps not surprising that Rose Kemp's early material (the Glance album) is largely acoustic folk. However, from that point on, she began to move into a more heavily guitar-orientated direction and it is perhaps significant that Glance is the only one of her albums that Kemp does not acknowledge on her website.

Mini-Album and A Hand Full Of Hurricanes can probably best be characterised as hard-edged indie-folk rock but Unholy Majesty and Golden Shroud have moved decisively into metal-edged doom rock, with Rose Kemp's image similarly moving."

Longer ago than they care to remember (1992-Ed), there was a band called Quiet Melon. Taking their name from the infamous Small Faces/Artwoods hybrid, they played raw 60's influenced garage and R'n'B. Sort of Prisoners/Creeps but without the keyboards!

Band members were :-
Rob Dady - Rhythm guitar
Lee Armitage - Vocals
Nigel Gwennap - Lead Guitar
Paul Doody - Bass
Hoppy - Drums

After blagging support slots with Glen Matlock (ex Sex Pistols), The Selecter and Doctor & the Medics, they were soon headlining themselves, and built up a loyal following. Like all line-ups though, it couldn't last. And anyway, The band couldn't keep up with Hoppy's drumming! Time for a change, and in came Kieron Battles on drums. A name change (for one gig only they were called Decembers Children) and couple of demo's were released, and despite lots of interest from the majors (Chrysalis records take note), the band never managed to sign the exclusive deal they'd hoped for. Paul left to pursue other projects, and Kieron went on to join Cinnamon Smith. Nigel, being Nigel, went off (he has a tendency to let his mind wander) and continued doing his thing with Black Cat. So in came Lee Harris (ex Tree House/The Cynics) on Bass, Matty Bane (ex Hip Tracies) on drums, and Steve Paul on Lead Guitar.

But something wasn't working. Lee Harris was really a frustrated guitarist so left to do his own thing. Rob switched to Bass (a smart move), which left a space for another guitarist, and in came Steve (Jock) Hendry. Now they were Roundabout!! This line up carried on quite successfully for a year or so, but there was trouble brewing in the ranks!! Lee Harris (the old bass player) was in the throws of forming a new band, Carnival, and the best singer he'd seen was already in a band, Roundabout infact. This was very flattering to singer Lee, and as he was already thinking it was time for a change, agreed to join him. Lee then sang in both of these bands for 6 months, but Rob was not best pleased, and Lee was subsequently sacked! The 2 of them not parting amicably, which was a great shame as they'd been mates for years.

Still.....on with the story. Steve Paul had new work commitment and so had to leave, which left just Rob, Matt and Jock. They needed a new singer and guitarist. They found and asked Nigel who as well as playing guitar now took on the keyboards, so he was back. Just a new singer required. Who could they find? Up step Andy Gibbons (ex Reverberation) who quickly learnt the songs and the show went on. Rob continued writing songs (on his own since Lee had left) and into the studio they went. Out they came with the album ""It's nice to be nice"" - a selection of old and new songs, Released by Arc Records. Incidentally, you'll notice that there's no songwriting credit for Lee Armitage as he and Rob still weren't talking, even though he was partially responsible for some of the songs. The album received much acclaim, but the touring was taking its toll. The boys like a drink at the best of times don't you know, amongst other things!! So they split. Simple as that. What once was great came to an end. Quite abruptly. Back to their day jobs. Back to the Hell of their day jobs!! A year went by. Jock wasn't happy. Rob wasn't happy. Lee (now ex Carnival/Nixon) wasn't happy. ""Lets get the old band back together"", cried Jock. ""Oh, go on then"", was the reply. Rob and Lee made up, Steve Paul came back on guitar, but Matty bane was now firmly ensconced in The More Specials. They needed a drummer, and up stepped Joe Tatley (ex Inflatable Sharks).

The line up was now
Rob Dady - Bass guitar
Lee Armitage - Vocals
Jock Hendry - Rhythm Guitar
Steve Paul - Lead Guitar
Joe Tatley - Drums

They rehearsed a batch of songs that came together so quickly it was unbelievable, and within a matter of weeks were back out gigging again. How they had missed it, and judging by crowd reactions, how they'd been missed!! They carried on for 6 months, but Steve Paul wasn't enjoying the live work (if he was honest, he preferred the studio anyway), so Ben (Phil O’pino) Watts was drafted in as his replacement. During all this, Lee had had a little boy, Oscar, and Jocks girlfriend was pregnant (with Jessica). Jock decided to leave, so Ben took over lead guitar. Erin Bardwell (ex Skanksters/Unity/The More Specials) was also drafted in on keyboards. Then Jock decided he didn't really want to go. So he stayed.

Now there were six!!
Rob Dady - Bass guitar
Lee Armitage - Vocals
Jock Hendry - Lead Guitar
Ben Watts - Rhythm Guitar
Erin Bardwell - keyboards
Joe Tatley - Drums

Into the studio again to record the EP ""Maximum Power Pop"". Maximum as a nod to The Who. Power Pop as the only way they could now describe the volume/intensity of their new live shows. Lee was a Mod after all!! October 2002 saw the departure of Joe and Jock to join Nova, a local covers band. It was a shame, but meant that original band members Matty Bane and Steve Paul could rejoin. This was the first time this original line up had played together in quite a few years, and the gigs rocked. Anyone who saw their version of Tin Soldier that night in December at Riffs would testify. Erin then left after the Christmas 2002 show to concentrate on his solo album, and Matty went with him. How could he refuse? They were recording in Jamaica after all!! So in came Steve Rose (ex Steerpyke) on drums. The next few months were filled with lots of recording and a few gigs (not enough), and then a break in the summer as Steve Roses’ wife Charlotte gave birth to their twins, Isaac and Esmé. A brother and sister for Maisie. During this break period, Ben decided to go his own way, and left to form a band with ex Roundabout singer Andy Gibbons and ex Carnival guitarist Lee Harris, the latter now playing drums. The Quezon City Rocket Corps. were then born! So, in came new boy Sam Drew on keyboards.

The line up was now:-
Rob Dady - Bass guitar, b. vox
Lee Armitage – Vocals, harmonica, guitar, tambourine, maraccas
Steve Paul - Lead Guitar, b.vox
Sam Drew - keyboards
Steve Rose - Drums

Incidentally, Matty Bain has now joined legendary Ska outfit Bad Manners. Dec 2003 saw the departure of Sam Drew, to be replaced by Dean Sweeney on guitar. Dean was a friend of Lee and Robs from years ago. In fact Lee was nearly the singer in Deans band The Rhythm Method back in 1985, but unfortunately it never came off as the drummer left to join the Army. But that's another story. Incidentally the bass player in that band was local Face Dean Belcher. He's now a famous photographer.

The current line up is now:-
Rob Dady - Bass guitar, b. vox
Lee Armitage – Vocals, harmonica, guitar, tambourine, maraccas
Steve Paul - Lead Guitar, b.vox
Dean Sweeney - Guitar
Steve Rose - Drums, b. vox

This founding line-up evolved out of previous combos with fluid memberships such as To Suckle The Pups and BackDrumMower.
The INECTO SCHOOL's instrumentation of double bass, trumpet/flugelhorn, drumkit, voice, guitar and percussion resembled that of a jazz band and their method was totally improvised but their music did not fall easily into any single musical category.
They recorded their music extensively in private sessions and performed live at concerts in Leeds and Glasgow through 2003-04, supporting artists such as Jack Rose, Frog Pocket, The One Ensemble of Daniel Padden and McWatt.  Recordings of these INECTO SCHOOL concerts were issued as 'The Together Road Tapes' (2CDR set) in 2005.
INECTO SCHOOL produced several self-released albums in small runs on CDR, with handmade covers, beginning with St. Vitus' Dance (2004); Wrangthorn (2004) and Night Works (2010). The band assembled their albums as 'scrapbooks' made up of edited extracts from longer improvised recordings. Sessions taped in 2003-04 provided the source material for all the group's album releases up to 2010.  These albums were co-produced/mastered variously by Daniel Padden, Matthew Robson and Alan Jenkins.
In September 2004 the original line-up ceased playing together with the relocation of two members abroad. 
In 2022 THE INECTO SCHOOL published a re-issue box set of its first three albums (supplemented by selected concert recordings) as RITUAL STILLS in an edition of 100, including facsimiles of original artwork and an illustrated booklet."

Their rebellious image combined with a commercial sound (partly thanks to producer Chris Thomas) created some of the most memorable moments of the 70s - both musical and otherwise. Line-up: Johnny Rotten (John Lydon, b. January 31, 1956 - vocals), Steve Jones (b. September 3, 1955 - guitar), Glen Matlock (b. August 27, 1956 - bass) and Paul Cook (b. July 20, 1956 - drums). In February 1977, Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious (John Ritchie aka John Beverley, b. May 10, 1957). The band effectively split up after their 1978 US tour, although Jones and Cook continued to record under the name for another year or so.

The original line-up reformed in 1996 for a series of concert tours, and has played live shows off and on since then, and released live recordings.

He has several productive and successful live-performing alliances, all ongoing, including with long-time collaborator Ian Blake, with Armenian duduk player Tigran Aleksanyan, and with Canada-based Chinese pipa and gu-cheng virtuoso Liu Fang and Vietnamese dan bau master Pham Duc Thanh.

He and the musicians on his 9th solo album, ""The Unbroken Surface of Snow"" (Cloud Valley, 2011) – Armenian duduk master Tigran Aleksanyan, multi-instrumentalist Ian Blake and Finnish singer Sanna Kurki-Suonio – became the band SANS, releasing ""SANS LIve"" in 2014, and, with the line-up expanded by the addition of Sanna's daughter Erika Hammarberg as co-vocalist, in 2018 released the album ""Kulku"" (Cloud Valley, 2018).

His 10th solo album, ""Zithers"" (Cloud Valley, 2020) is entirely solo, featuring just two instruments, both of them – as the title suggests – zithers: the electrified 74-string chord zither that has been a key instrument for him throughout his career, and a more recent one of his own devising, the marovantele, which has 22 pairs of strings on each side. 

As a world music journalist Andrew Cronshaw writes features and reviews, particularly for fRoots magazine but also including the Nordic, Baltic and Portuguese chapters in The Rough Guide to World Music, etc.
Apart from his own albums, he has produced, and often engineered, albums by June Tabor, Silly Sisters, Bill Caddick, Zumzeaux, Brendan Power, Salamakannel, Nikolai Blad and others, and produced the mixes of Flook's Flatfish and of Hannu Saha's Mahla.
Session work includes playing on albums by Hue & Cry, Scott Walker, Suede, Natacha Atlas, Martin Simpson, Pascal Gaigne, B.J.Cole and Ute Lemper, on film soundtracks including Outlaw King, Tolkien, GI Jane, and others. The song 'Zitherbell', which he co-wrote and performs with Natacha Atlas on her album 'Foretold in the Language of Dreams', appears in Jonathan Demme's film 'The Truth About Charlie'.

Egypt's original line-up first got together in a squat in Shepherds Bush, London in late 1987, but the story really begins a few weeks before when ex-Groundhogs bass player Alan Fish and ex-Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker were asked to record the very first album release (literally serial number 001) for the then fledgling record label HTD Records (HTD are now Talking Elephant Records and deal with Wishbone Ash, Fairport Convention, Ritchie Blackmore, Steven Stills, etc.). Also included was guitarist Don Greer (ex-Bachman Turner Overdrive and others).

This initial plan got as far as some recording sessions (unreleased) before Clive found himself unavailable due to other commitments and Don decided to move back home to the States and was unable to continue, though he would later fill in for a broken-thumbed Eric Chipulina whilst Egypt were in the US for a short while in the early 1990s. Alan was determined to carry on but was now on his own with recording and gig commitments to fulfil. Having difficulty finding the right musicians he began looking for a suitable ready-made band instead and met the first Egypt drummer Peter Chichon at one of these auditions. Peter was also there to audition but opted to pitch in with Alan instead.

Alan Fish started off his musical career (as guitarist initially) playing skiffle at the age of 12. As a teenager during the 1960s he had been in bands in the far east supporting The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks and other names of the era before relocating in the UK where he was again, during the 1960s/70s, supporting many name acts including David Bowie. He had recently left his bass playing job with bike rally favourites Dumpys Rusty Nuts and had played since the mid-seventies with the legendary Tony T S McPhee in The Groundhogs, Terraplane, and Tony McPhee's Turbo, recording several albums. In the 1980s he joined Tredegar (with ex-Budgie drummer & guitarist Ray Philips and Tony Bourge) and was involved in many other projects including a European tour with Chuck Berry and a couple of albums with ex-Bo Diddley harp player Billy Boy Arnold. His entire CV is too long to include here.

Peter Chichon had recently been drumming for infamous London trash/glam rockers The Gunslingers and had already played in several bands with guitarist Eric Chipulina, who joined up after playing the Benny Hill theme tune (!) at an impromptu audition at the aforementioned Shepherds Bush squat. Eric had until that time been gigging around London with Periphery (with Bill Kruse and Francis Pecino). Finally, on vocals came in Ryka who had previously been in Shattered with Peter. This line-up barely stuck together long enough to record the first album (produced by NWOBHM pioneer Paul Samson) in 1988 and do a couple of brief UK tours of mostly smaller hall and club venues.

The music at this point was very different from the blues rock style that developed later on. There was a recording and gigging schedule to keep within weeks of forming which saw some studio work begin even before a singer had been found. Material for both studio and live performances was hurriedly written and sourced from different genres, past projects, etc. and the result was a mixture of thrash metal and older metal styles along with several other things including North African and Andalusian influences, hence the name Egypt. It was suggested by the record company HTD (now Talking Elephant Records) after hearing Find A Way, a track with a somewhat Egyptian sounding riff which featured on the first album. With HTD literally waiting for a name to put on the cover so they could go ahead with artwork and release (and with the pub about to open any minute) the name was adopted despite doubts about it as no one could think of anything else in the time available.

The first album was released in 1988 getting plenty of airplay on national radio (Radio One Rock Show, featured album on Radio Caroline, etc.), an airing on a late night 'jukebox jury' type TV show on Channel 4 and press coverage nationwide. However there was a problem with distribution (by EMI subsidiary Supertrack) and by the time the album reached the shops the moment had gone. After so much money and effort had been spent and with HTD nearly sunk almost before it had even started, and therefore unable to carry on the momentum, there seemed to be nowhere to go and the band gradually began to fall apart. The first to leave was Ryka, who went on to record a solo album project with songwriting duo Nick Jefferson and Alistar Nicholson in a project called Sine on Minority One Records. Next to leave was Peter Chichon, who later found cult success in the UK and worldwide with the excellent Breed 77. Ironically a badly edited bootleg of the album made an appearance soon after and was apparently selling well.

The Wilderness Years[edit]

The first year or so immediately following the split is a blur of drummers and vocalists, many of them musician friends from the past helping to keep things going. For a while on rhythm/2nd guitar was sound engineer/road manager Dick Wilson who has been involved with Egypt from day one. Alan and Eric took over on vocal duties and played blues and rock'n'roll numbers, many of which Alan knew from his days with Chuck Berry. Despite the lack of any backing and general apathy from record companies, agencies, etc., the band managed to keep on gigging, sometimes under different names, while deciding whether to continue using the name Egypt as the style was changing so much from what it started out as. In time Eric took over more on vocals, becoming the main vocalist. This was the beginning of the transition to the current version of Egypt, in that the circumstances forced a re-invention as a more back-to-the-roots blues/rock three piece, which gradually evolved to include a more progressive blues side and a delta blues side alongside the rockers.

The 'Hogs Years-pt I[edit]

One thing that very much re-enforced this direction was joining (or in Alan's case re-joining) legendary progressive blues outfit The Groundhogs circa 1989 when Tony McPhee needed a backing band for a gig in Liverpool and asked his old bass player Alan if he could 'borrow' his band. Eventually Egypt members were to form part of various versions of the 'Hogs for the next ten years or so. By this time there had finally been found a regular drummer in Chris Bennett (previously with original Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di'Anno). All three went into The Groundhogs and continued gigging as Egypt as well (including a few weeks gigs and TV appearance in Dubai) until some time in 1991 when Chris left. More drumming friends again helped to keep Egypt going until the summer of that year.

The Present Line-up[edit]

In mid-1991 Peter Correa who had already played in bands with Eric in the dim and distant past decided to uproot from his (and Eric's) native Gibraltar and take the plunge with Egypt. This is probably where the band in its current form started, recording Preserving The Dead in 1994 for a now fast recovering but much slimmed down HTD Records. This is the CD that most of the original stuff played live over the next few years came from and the first to be representative of the current bluesier style.

The 'Hogs Years-pt II[edit]

It would have been around 1992 or 1993 that all three, one by one, joined/rejoined The Groundhogs, now and then gigging in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, apart from the regular UK circuit. They can be heard backing Tony McPhee on the Groundhogs album Lost Tapes II, recorded live in Milan in June 1994 although it was not released until several years later. Again both bands were on the go at the same time and several occasions saw Egypt doing an opening set at a Groundhogs gig.

The 'Hogs Years-pt III[edit]

Around 1996 Alan left The Groundhogs and Eric switched over to bass (initially for a couple of German gigs but in fact for about 3 years) recording the CD Hogs In Wolf's Clothing and a video Live from The Astoria London both in 1998,and another CD The Muddy Waters Songbook in 1999. Towards the end of 1999 Eric and Peter left The Groundhogs to concentrate more on Egypt, which had been pushed aside to a certain extent.

Y2K[edit]

With the decision made to focus efforts on Egypt again, things slowly but steadily began to progress over the next few years. In early 2003 Alan went to Spain for a few months to work with ex-Uriah Heep keyboard player Ken Hensley and ex-members of Wings and AC/DC. Soon after this a long overdue new CD Midnight Sun was recorded at Purple Studios in Norwich and released mid-2004 on Blues Matters Records.

The Present[edit]

From the very beginning, more than 20 years ago, Egypt has built up a reputation as a hard working live band and have rarely stopped gigging for more than a couple of weeks at a time since then. Gigs are constantly being booked throughout the UK and abroad with regular gigs in Spain, Germany and elsewhere. Also the re-release of the second and third albums (Preserving the Dead and Midnight Sun) and the recording and release of the next (and fourth) album Bluesbelly, all on Stable Records.

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

This could then be manipulated by moving magnets around the receiver in the radio. In fact the oblique band moniker soon became the identity of just one man, [a=Michael Anthony Keane], whose chequered history is a complicated tale of perseverance in the face of adversity. After sending a tape with sound frequencies and rap, they were signed by [l=Factory].

1979 RFATP were joined by [a=Nathan McGough] (bass) and [a=Phil Hurst] (drums), and Mike Keane took over vocals, guitar and keyboards. Played at the Moonlight Club in London supporting Joy Division.
By 1980 Phil Hurst left to join Hollycaust and was replaced by [a=Donald Johnson].

The end of 1981 and into the following year saw the Royal Family revert back to the original duo, playing their final gig at Plato's Ballroom (which Arthur & Nathan had set up as a venue). Arthur then moved to Newcastle and Mike got involved in solo projects and also formed Legend Agency & the Project

1984 Mike Keen is resurrecting the Royal Family with himself, [a=John Neesham] on violin, [a=Peter Hook] on drums, vocals, keyboards, [a=Lita Hira] on keyboards, and [a=Chris Jones] (vocals). Mike Keane is touring the UK at this point with [a=Stockholm Monsters].

In 1985, The Royal Family & The Poor left Factory Records and Mike Keane formed his own record label, Gaia Communications World Network. They quickly released one LP and a 12"" single, as well as recording an entire collection of new material before the distribution company Red Rhino collapsed, effectively wiping-out the label over night.
1984/85 also sees another complete new line-up: Mike Keane (vocals, keyboards, guitar, percussion), [a=Karen Halewood] (keyboards), [a=John Walsh (2)] (bass, guitar), [a=Ambrose Reynolds] (bass, percussion), [a=Jeff Turner (3)] (saxophone, guitar, violin), [a=Kif Cole] (percussion). This line up toured with New Order.

1986 saw Jeff, Karen and Kif depart and to be replaced by Paula Simms (vocals), [a=John Metcalfe] (violin) and Judith Laity (cello). Touring Holland.

In 1987 RFATP recruites [a=Simon Crab] (vocals, keyboards), [a=Merlin Shepherd] (saxophone), [a=Andy Frizell] (bass). Band toured Germany & Belgium.
Pete Fuck (aka Pic Meter, Peter Jones, Cosmic) played keyboards in 1987 (then aged 19), but didn’t do any gigs.

In 1995 ""Gaia Communications World Network"" is re-launched, releasing the third audio release by Gaia Records, recorded during 1989-1990, a CD LP release titled, ""Songs For The Children Of Baphomet: A Musickal Celebration on the Theme of Magick and A Tribute to The Life & Works Of Aleister Crowley, (1875 - 1947)"".

In 2004 another release followed: ""North West Soul"" on The Boutique Label. In 2010 Arthur McDonald self-released a new album titled ""The Pope's Daughter"" under the RFATP moniker, though this project did not involve Mike Keane."

Motörhead,3 Classic Albums,233658,,11943407,UK,2004,152.53,51,['Compilation'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister (1945–2015), professionally known by his stage name Lemmy, who had remained the sole constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

By the time they released their debut full-length [i]Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666[/i] in 1997, the name had been shortened to HIM to make their name easier on the Finnish tongue as well as to tone down the more occult elements of their public image.

Their fourth album, [i]Love Metal[/i], expanded their popularity to the U.S., giving them the status of world-wide rock stars. The album [i]Dark Light[/i] spawned the hit ""Wings of a Butterfly"", which became the band's biggest US hit and made [i]Dark Light[/i] the first album by a Finnish act to go gold in the US.

The Associates,Sulk : Fourth Drawer Down,18509,,2427530,UK,2004,0.0,32,"['Album', 'Reissue', 'Remastered']",['Rock'],"['Alternative Rock', 'New Wave']","[a=Billy MacKenzie] and [a=Alan Rankine] formed The Associates in Dundee, Scotland, in 1976. They released a self-funded 7"" of [m=304539] mere weeks after [a=David Bowie] had released his original. This scam got them a publishing deal with Bowie's publishers and a proper record deal.  

By 1980 they were touring with [a=The Cure] and signed to [l=Fiction Records], for whom they recorded [m=72502]. At the turn of the year they relocated to [l=Situation Two] and put out a string of singles, later compiled on the album [m=72538], recorded using money from major labels who were expecting demos to be produced with their cash. In tandem with their increasing consumption of cocaine and speed, the group's music became increasingly deranged and experimental. [a=John Murphy] and [a284809] (ex-The Cure) became official members. 

The Associates signed with WEA in 1982. [a=Martha Ladly] joined as back-up singer. Billy and Alan immediately scored a string of UK top 20 chart hits. The album [m=72576] made the UK top 10, winning album of the year awards in the UK music press. The group’s drug use was at a peak - Billy and Alan’s behaviour was becoming somewhat erratic. On the eve of their biggest ever UK tour MacKenzie pulled out. A US deal with Island was consequentially lost. Deciding that he couldn't continue, Alan Rankine left the group. From this moment on, the Associates were to be just that: Billy MacKenzie solo, with different associates for each release.

MacKenzie started recording a follow-up album. 1984s [m=72626] cost WEA £250,000. It took three years and four production teams to record - twice (dissatisfied with the original production Billy ""lost"" the first versions' master tapes, forcing a re-recording). The album had some chart success, but WEA were dissatisfied, and started pressuring MacKenzie to follow a more straightforward pop-soul direction. Frustrated by WEA's lack of support, MacKenzie focussed on collaborations, most notably with [a=Yello] (featuring on One Second, Flag, Baby and writing The Rhythm Divine). 

1988's comeback single, a cover of Blondie's [m=72630], failed to chart. WEA refused to release its parent album, The Glamour Chase, and with MacKenzie over a million pounds in debt to the label The Associates were dropped. 

Circa quickly signed MacKenzie and in 1990 released Wild And Lonely, the last album of original music under the The Associates name. 1992's album, the [a=Thomas Fehlmann] / [a=Boris Blank]-produced Outernational was issued under the artist name [a=Billy MacKenzie]. Even though the album had good reviews in the press and Baby was single of the week in Melody Maker, the album stiffed - partially due to Circa winding down operations. 

Aside from an aborted Associates reunion with Alan Rankine in the mid-90s, MacKenzie remained a solo artist, collaborating in the 90s with [a=Peach], [a=Barry Adamson], [a=Paul Haig] and [a=Apollo Four Forty] amongst others. At the end of 1996, after four years without a deal, he signed with Nude Records.

Tragically his first release for the label was a posthumous one. The death of his mother in 1996 was likely the trigger of an emotional breakdown that led him deeper and deeper into a depressed state. Billy MacKenzie died aged 39, on 22nd January 1997 from an overdose of prescribed and over-the-counter pills.

Alan Rankine passed away from natural causes at the age of 64 on the 2nd of January 2023.

Mitchell was born Albert  George Cernik to Croatian immigrants February 22, 1927  in Detroit, Michigan. The family moved when he was 11 to Los Angeles then to San Francisco where, after leaving school, he worked as a saddle maker, supplementing his income by singing. Dude Martin, who had a country music broadcast in San Francisco, hired him for his band.

Cernik served in the United States Navy for two years in World War II, then sang with Carmen Cavallaro's big band. In 1947 he recorded for Decca with Cavallaro's band, but left due to food poisoning. He went next to New York City and made records for King Records as Al Grant (one, ""Cabaret"", appeared in the Variety charts). He won on the radio show Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1949 as a soloist.

Mitch Miller at Columbia records signed him in 1950 and urged him to change his name. Miller originally had intended to record a sentimental ballad called ""My Heart Cries for You"" and ""The Roving Kind"" with Frank Sinatra, however, Sinatra was not interested and rejected the songs. Mitchell recorded them and ""My Heart Cries for You"" became Mitchell's first hit song, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts. He continued with hits including ""Heartaches by the Number"" (#1 US), ""Rock-a-Billy"" (a crossover into the rock and roll field), ""The Same Old Me"" and the gigantic ""Singing the Blues"", which was number one for 10 weeks in 1956. He toured the world and had hits globally, especially in the UK and Australia. He placed nine songs in the US Top 10, 20 songs into the UK Top 10 (including 8 number ones) and 19 songs in the Australian Top 10 (including 3 number ones).

In the 1950s and 1960s Mitchell acted in such movies as Those Redheads From Seattle (1953) and Red Garters (1954), on television and hosted his own television show in 1957.

Mitchell's popularity waned in the 1960s, although he continued to record songs for a number of labels. In 1990, he appeared in several episodes of the BBC drama series Your Cheatin' Heart as the fictional country singer Jim Bob O'May, singing several standards including his own hit ""Singing the Blues"".

Mitchell died on July 1, 1999, aged 72, at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada of complications from cancer surgery.

His song ""Heartaches by the Number"" was part of the soundtrack of the 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas.

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.
 
Genesis P-Orridge died after a long battle with leukaemia on 14th March 2020."

The couple played together as a duo throughout the 70’s and 80’s and with countless classic line ups – Albion Country Band, Steeleye Span, Richard Thompson, Brass Monkey to name but a few.
In the hills of Shropshire, Benji, like other children immersed in the folk world, was brought up listening to a wide range of musical styles. It wasn’t long before he was picking up instruments and with the arrival of an electric guitar into his life, Benji began listening to 50’s Rock n’ Roll, before moving via ZZ Top to Jimi Hendrix.  
At college, Benji formed a band called The Hedgerows, who eventually evolved into an acoustic outfit, resulting in them having a song (penned by Benji) featured on Evolving Tradition 1 (Mrs Casey Records) in 1995. This got Benji’s name noticed and his solo debut (‘Dance in the Shadow’) was released in 1998 on the Wildgoose label. Benji joined the band Dr Faustus in the same year. 
In 2004, Benji’s 2nd solo album, ‘Half a Fruit Pie’, was released, this time on the Fellside label.
In the same year, Folk/funk/jazz/soul big band, Bellowhead was formed and Benji was a founder member. With an appearance on BBC TV’s ‘Later’ and performances everywhere from the Royal Opera House to the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, the band has gone from strength to strength. They are headlining festivals in the UK and in Europe and, following in St Etienne’s footsteps, have recently been named as Band in Residence at London’s South Bank Centre for 2008."

Blur,Blur / Modern Life Is Rubbish,7551,,7385790,UK,2004,0.0,32,"['Album', 'Reissue']","['Rock', 'Pop']","['Alternative Rock', 'Indie Rock', 'Britpop']","Indie rock / pop band with art school roots from London, England, composed of [a=Damon Albarn], [a=Graham Coxon] (1989-2002, 2008- ), [a=Alex James (2)], and [a=Dave Rowntree]. The band was formed in Colchester in December 1989 as [a=Seymour] but was renamed Blur in March 1990, after they'd signed for the Food label. Blur's early releases (the Leisure album and the singles off it) were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of ""baggy"" bands from the Madchester scene and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, at times reminding of Syd Barrett. Tthis was more readily apparent on several single B-sides where the group let loose a darker side.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music (e.g. The Kinks or XTC) or even nostalgic music from World War II. Their 2nd album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) had moderate success but began attracting attention for its Britishness but in hindsight it rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, with groups like [a=Suede] early frontrunners too. In 1994 Blur released what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album: Parklife. 1995's The Great Escape was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. 

When the 5th studio album Blur came out in 1997, the group had reinvented their sound. They severed ties from Britpop and reincorporated the art rock experimentalism of their early years, only this time the music was informed by a broader range of influences (e.g. Pavement). The album's second song Song 2 was released as a single and became a hit on alternative dancefloors. Subsequent albums 13 and Think Tank further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe.

After 13 and the subsequent tours, the band took a pause and its members pursued personal projects. In 1998 Albarn started the [a6378] project, Alex James engaged in [a120885] with Damien Hirst, and Graham Coxon released his first solo album the same year. Over the years Coxon had started struggling with alcoholism and when Blur started the recording sessions for Think Tank, it came to a point where they asked him to no longer be present. After its release in 2003 the band went on full hiatus until December 2008, when it was announced the band would reunite for concerts in London's Hyde Park (released as All The People) followed by a series of major concerts e.g. at Glastonbury 2009. The next year saw the release of a a documentary about the band ([url=https://www.discogs.com/master/898685-Blur-No-Distance-Left-To-Run]No Distance Left To Run[/url]) and of the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/241338-Blur-Fools-Day]Fool's Day[/url] single for RSD 2010.

In July 2012 a career spanning box set was released titled [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/460605-Blur-Blur-21-The-Box]Blur 21[/url], and in August 2012 the band headlined a show in Hyde Park for the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics (released as [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/500654-Blur-Parklive]Parklive[/url]). Earlier that year the band had tried to record a studio album with [a2728] as producer but that was aborted. In Autumn 2012 the band again paused its activities.

Early 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album: The Magic Whip. It had been created in 5 days in Hong Kong after a Japan tour that was cancelled in 2013. Following the Magic Whip tour the band went into hiatus again ... resurfacing in 2023 with their 9th studio album The Ballad Of Darren and a series of concerts. In April 2024 Albarn stated that their performance at Coachella was probably the band’s “last gig”. On 19 July 2024 a second documentary titled To The End opened in UK and Irish cinemas, as directed by Toby L.

This founding line-up evolved out of previous combos with fluid memberships such as To Suckle The Pups and BackDrumMower.
The INECTO SCHOOL's instrumentation of double bass, trumpet/flugelhorn, drumkit, voice, guitar and percussion resembled that of a jazz band and their method was totally improvised but their music did not fall easily into any single musical category.
They recorded their music extensively in private sessions and performed live at concerts in Leeds and Glasgow through 2003-04, supporting artists such as Jack Rose, Frog Pocket, The One Ensemble of Daniel Padden and McWatt.  Recordings of these INECTO SCHOOL concerts were issued as 'The Together Road Tapes' (2CDR set) in 2005.
INECTO SCHOOL produced several self-released albums in small runs on CDR, with handmade covers, beginning with St. Vitus' Dance (2004); Wrangthorn (2004) and Night Works (2010). The band assembled their albums as 'scrapbooks' made up of edited extracts from longer improvised recordings. Sessions taped in 2003-04 provided the source material for all the group's album releases up to 2010.  These albums were co-produced/mastered variously by Daniel Padden, Matthew Robson and Alan Jenkins.
In September 2004 the original line-up ceased playing together with the relocation of two members abroad. 
In 2022 THE INECTO SCHOOL published a re-issue box set of its first three albums (supplemented by selected concert recordings) as RITUAL STILLS in an edition of 100, including facsimiles of original artwork and an illustrated booklet."

Brothers Hugh (vocals, rhythm) and Norm (drums) had previously played in a mod rock band called The Cinnamon Firm which had recently broke up after several line up changes. The Firm were a popular live act in Ireland and had enjoyed a few local tv appearances and attracted interest from a couple of major record labels. At the same time Norm was also playing drums for a loud dirty garage rock and roll band called Thee Dreggs. Thee Dreggs vocalist and rhythm guitarist had recently left the band to set up home in Belgium. The members of the Cinnamon Firm and Thee Dreggs had been friends for years so it seemed like a natural solution to invite Hugh to get together with remaining Dreggs - Bobby (lead guitar), Will (Bass, Vocals) and Norm to form a new band. The merger brought Hugh's mod songwriting sensibilities together with raw rootsy garage band ethics. The new band was called THE KEEPERS. They managed to retain the essence and power of their old bands but with an added dynamic that gives them their own distinct brand of Belfast beat. it wasn't long before they had written a handful of songs. They recorded the tracks straight away while they were still fresh and vibrant to their ears, a philosophy they have continued through all their recordings. On May 24th of that year, the band played their first gig to a great response in front of 200 people at Belfast's Limelight club and have since been playing regularly around Northern Ireland and other places such as England, Rep of Ireland, Isle of Man, Holland, Belgium and Germany.

Their sound is ingrained with elements of garage rock, RandB, mod and punk but refuses to be pigeon-holed into any of these genres. The music is like a hit from an injected drug - instant, colourful, direct, loud, highly addictive rock 'n' roll that will mainline straight to your soul. Sick and tired of an endless slew of pop and shoe-gazing indie bands the Keepers are hitting back with raw ballsy rockin' tunes, Big ol' hairy monkey balls baby! But this is not protest music. These boys don't waste time protesting, this is DIRECT ACTION!

The Keepers' set is comprised mostly of well-crafted original material with a helping of cool covers of some of their favourite songs. Their hair-raising live reputation helped them land a weekly residency and their own club night (Balloon Farm) in Belfast's Duke of York bar, a savvy mixture of live rock 'n' roll and hip vinyl sounds which they ran for several months.

Their first single - 'Stop Pretending' was released in early 2001 and is available on seven inch vinyl from Barcelona's Butterfly Records label. The band have also released a five track CD on Italy's AUA Records as well as two self-released CD albums. Tracks by the Keepers are also available on compilation albums from labels such As El Torro and No Action.

So there you have it, good 'ol rock 'n' roll is alive and well in Belfast and these boys are the keepers of the faith. So, seek ye The Keepers and prepare for heaven!! "

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

A chance meeting with guitar virtuoso Hartley Cain led to the formation of a rock band. He rapidly built up a large fan base around the Midlands, London and Germany. The rock career lost momentum when the major album Rogues & Thieves did not take off but he did get on Top Of The Pops as part of his mate, Roy Wood¹s band, The Move. Gradually his music became more Country and he was invited by Mervyn Conn to be part of the famed Wembley Festivals. Mervyn Conn backed two albums recorded in Nashville with the Jordanaires and Hargus Pig Robbins. The first, Southern Fried Frog was and still is a massive seller. Froggie did and still does sing 99 percent of his own material and he has the largest following of any UK artist.
His autobiography, Raymond Who?, is a great read. UK singers cover more of his songs than any other writer. When he released Don't Let Me Cry Again, Terry Wogan played it every day for a fortnight but unfortunately a distribution blip stopped it being a major pop hit.
After fighting health problems he was still a major player on the UK Country scene having played with most of the major American artists including Tina Turner who recorded one of his songs. Raymond Froggatt is the only UK artist to have played the Albert Hall, London Palladium and the Birmingham Symphony Hall. He was one of an elite band who could have a theatre tour each year."

Blur,Leisure / Modern Life Is Rubbish,7551,,30517744,UK,2004,0.0,30,"['Album', 'Reissue']","['Rock', 'Pop']","['Alternative Rock', 'Indie Rock', 'Britpop']","Indie rock / pop band with art school roots from London, England, composed of [a=Damon Albarn], [a=Graham Coxon] (1989-2002, 2008- ), [a=Alex James (2)], and [a=Dave Rowntree]. The band was formed in Colchester in December 1989 as [a=Seymour] but was renamed Blur in March 1990, after they'd signed for the Food label. Blur's early releases (the Leisure album and the singles off it) were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of ""baggy"" bands from the Madchester scene and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, at times reminding of Syd Barrett. Tthis was more readily apparent on several single B-sides where the group let loose a darker side.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music (e.g. The Kinks or XTC) or even nostalgic music from World War II. Their 2nd album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) had moderate success but began attracting attention for its Britishness but in hindsight it rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, with groups like [a=Suede] early frontrunners too. In 1994 Blur released what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album: Parklife. 1995's The Great Escape was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. 

When the 5th studio album Blur came out in 1997, the group had reinvented their sound. They severed ties from Britpop and reincorporated the art rock experimentalism of their early years, only this time the music was informed by a broader range of influences (e.g. Pavement). The album's second song Song 2 was released as a single and became a hit on alternative dancefloors. Subsequent albums 13 and Think Tank further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe.

After 13 and the subsequent tours, the band took a pause and its members pursued personal projects. In 1998 Albarn started the [a6378] project, Alex James engaged in [a120885] with Damien Hirst, and Graham Coxon released his first solo album the same year. Over the years Coxon had started struggling with alcoholism and when Blur started the recording sessions for Think Tank, it came to a point where they asked him to no longer be present. After its release in 2003 the band went on full hiatus until December 2008, when it was announced the band would reunite for concerts in London's Hyde Park (released as All The People) followed by a series of major concerts e.g. at Glastonbury 2009. The next year saw the release of a a documentary about the band ([url=https://www.discogs.com/master/898685-Blur-No-Distance-Left-To-Run]No Distance Left To Run[/url]) and of the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/241338-Blur-Fools-Day]Fool's Day[/url] single for RSD 2010.

In July 2012 a career spanning box set was released titled [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/460605-Blur-Blur-21-The-Box]Blur 21[/url], and in August 2012 the band headlined a show in Hyde Park for the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics (released as [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/500654-Blur-Parklive]Parklive[/url]). Earlier that year the band had tried to record a studio album with [a2728] as producer but that was aborted. In Autumn 2012 the band again paused its activities.

Early 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album: The Magic Whip. It had been created in 5 days in Hong Kong after a Japan tour that was cancelled in 2013. Following the Magic Whip tour the band went into hiatus again ... resurfacing in 2023 with their 9th studio album The Ballad Of Darren and a series of concerts. In April 2024 Albarn stated that their performance at Coachella was probably the band’s “last gig”. On 19 July 2024 a second documentary titled To The End opened in UK and Irish cinemas, as directed by Toby L.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

Originally a painter as a child, coL turned to music as a teenager, and never looked back. He is a self-taught musician and plays the guitar, bass, drums, synthesizer, and pattern programming. coL's singing has always been punk in it's nature, letting whatever comes out be. Over the years coL has remained true to this style, even going as far as improvising several albums' lyrics on the spot. Independence and forward thinking have always been at the forefront of coL's work. In 2001, he founded the underground label: JesusWarhol Records. A year later, after shooting his first music video, he created: Factory 3 Films. Directing videos for Spookey Ruben, R. Stevie Moore, and Pikelet among others. Next came Dead Designs to highlight his Graphics, which includes work for Lilys and Tones On Tail. 
 
He has collaborated with various underground artists: OFFBEAT (with Aaron Embry), Atheif (with Ariel Pink), Colour Sons (with Doleful Lions) Tall Children (with Karoline Hausted), as well as working with Of Life and Richard Sax Ross as producer. In 2013 Boards of Canada mentioned coL's work, in an interview for Humo Magazine. They later included one of his songs in their NTS Radio mix for the 30th anniversary of Warp records. - Derek Charles
