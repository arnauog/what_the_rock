21148,702877,3947624,UK,23 Skidoo,Seven Songs,1982,0.0,8,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Tribal', 'Industrial']","23 Skidoo are a British band playing a fusion of industrial, post-punk, alternative dance, rock, and world music. The group was named after an early 20th century American slang phrase that appeared in the work of Aleister Crowley, William S. Burroughs, Robert Anton Wilson and filmmaker Julian Biggs. Formed in 1979 by Fritz Catlin, Johnny Turnbull and Sam Mills, and later augmented by Alex Turnbull and Tom Heslop, 23 Skidoo had interests in martial arts, Burundi and Kodo drumming, Fela Kuti, The Last Poets, William S. Burroughs, as well as the emerging confluence of industrial, post-punk and funk, heard in artists such as A Certain Ratio, Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, The Pop Group and This Heat.

Their first 7"", ""Ethics"" was released in 1980, followed by the ""Last Words"" 12"", produced by Stephen Mallinder from Cabaret Voltaire. A Peel Session was recorded on September 16, 1981 that included other associates Richard Heslop and Tim Soar. Their debut album, Seven Songs, was released in 1982 and is said to evoke the claustrophobic humidity of an African forest. An experimental EP Tearing Up The Plans was produced without the Turnbull brothers, who were traveling in Indonesia. Guitarist Sam Mills and vocalist Tom Heslop left the band soon after, and with the arrival of slap-bassist Peter ""Sketch"" Martin following the break-up of Linx, the lineup remained the same until their disintegration in 2003.

With the Turnbull brothers back from Indonesia where they were exposed to Gamelan, the band recruited Aswad's horn section for the ""Coup"" 12"", which featured samples from Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. It has been alleged that The Chemical Brothers stole the bass line for their ""Block Rockin' Beats"" track. The Culling Is Coming (1983 - noted for featuring the band live at the first WOMAD Festival) and Urban Gamelan (1984) followed, criticized at the time for their shift towards more abstract sounds. After having been evicted from their rehearsal space at Genesis P-Orridge's 'Death Factory' the band shifted their focus towards hip hop and released a few singles and a compilation album Just Like Everybody in 1987.

In 1989 the Turnbull brothers formed the Ronin label, and released material by Deckwrecka, Roots Manuva, and Rodney P amongst others. They signed to Virgin Records in 1991 and were able to build a new studio with their advance. In 2000 they released a self-titled LP, which featured contributions from Pharoah Sanders and Roots Manuva. This was followed by a compilation of singles, The Gospel Comes To New Guinea in 2002, and for the first time on CD, reissues of Seven Songs and Urban Gamelan. In 2003 the Turnbull brothers liquidated the company. In 2008 LTM reissued the whole back catalog of 23 Skidoo.

Bondy is actually the birth name (the initials stand for Augeste Arthur) of Scott Bondy, the former lead singer of Birmingham, AL's Southern grunge darlings Verbena, frequently compared to Nirvana because of their gritty, aggressive sound and Bondy's searing vocals. The band, which also initially included drummer Les Nuby and bassist Daniel Johnston, was formed when all three were in high school in the early '90s. Later singer and guitarist Anne Marie Griffin joined the trio, then called Shallow. Nuby eventually left the group and was replaced by original Remy Zero drummer Louis Schefano, and after a name change to Verbena, the band released the EP Pilot Park on Merge. Nuby rejoined the band a year later in time for Verbena's debut full-length, Souls for Sale, which caught the ears of Dave Grohl, who agreed to produce the band's major-label debut, Into the Pink. Johnston left the band, making Verbena a trio once again, and it was as a trio that Verbena recorded their third album, 2003's La Musica Negra, before calling it quits. Bondy retreated to his Catskills home in Palenville in upstate New York and in time began writing songs again, emerging with a stripped-down indie folk sound. He recorded and mixed his debut solo album, American Hearts, at a barn near his home, releasing the project in 2007 on the Superphonic imprint. The album was picked up by Fat Possum and re-released early in 2008. A second Fat Possum album, When the Devil's Loose, appeared in 2009."

The Adolescents remained dormant throughout the 1990s but members participated in a number of different bands.  In 2001, the Blue Album line-up reunited again to play shows live shows.  Casey Royer and Rikk Agnew soon bowed out but the band.  By 2006, Steve Soto and Tony Brandenburg were the only remaining members of the band's original line-up.  Backed by a revolving cast of guitarists and drummers, the band continued to record and tour, releasing a steady stream of albums throughout the 2010s.  In 2017, Casey Royer and Rikk Agnew launched the Radolescents, a group composed of various ex-Adolescents members dedicated to playing music from the Adolescents early days.  On Jue 27, 2018, Steve Soto, the only member to play with the band through every phase of their career, passed away unexpectedly at age 54, just prior to the release of their album ""Cropduster"".

Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, ending the band.
They have been categorized as grindcore, noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation (at least via their recordings) for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a ""cock rock"" album entitled Fuckin' A. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome was released digitally in 2010."

(Originally named Troop 101)

Soulful, fresh, genre-defying. These are only a few of the terms that immediately spark the mind when greeted with Anarbor’s gutsy and transcending EP, Free Your Mind. When noted that the aforementioned genre is pop-rock, it seems even more special that a band with this talent and bravado would push itself away from a scene where predetermined trappings threaten to undermine its singular integrity.
“We know that every single kid out there is tired of the same old dance-pop record that gets released every single week. Our goal is to be the music scene’s saving grace,” says guitarist Mike Kitlas. “It will tell our listeners that we are here to stay and we are not a fad band that will fade out as soon as dance-pop is outdated.”

Free Your Mind extends beyond the cut-and-paste albums being churned out, instead infusing dynamic guitars behind the soul-shaking howls and relatable melodies from frontman Slade Echeverria. Crafted in Los Angeles by producer Mike Green (Paramore, Good Charlotte) over a four-week span in Los Angeles, Free Your Mind's formation came from a desire to break out from the ""fad band"" chokehold and delve into what was real.
The EP's lyrical themes of drama-addled love are age-appropriate for this band still fresh from cap and gown status, yet show emerging maturity and growth while navigating the waters of life on the road and in the press, as well as their loss of anonymity. Not one track doesn’t contain a purpose or reason ripped from the band’s own personal headlines, and the EP title wasn’t without a conscious peek into their agenda, either.
“We want to challenge kids to think outside of the norm, and really find themselves, rather then just following what the crowd is doing,” Kitlas said. “We want to show our listeners that they are not alone, we all go through our struggles and everyone has their ups and downs in life.”
The seven-track EP, kicks off with a mischievous call to a wayward paramour on “Let The Games Begin,” before sliding into the instant hip-shaking grooves of “The Brightest Green,” a slice of Maroon 5-ish soul that takes on a life of its own. Anarbor takes a familiar formula but adds a warmth and genuineness to every guitar lick and lyric that keeps them relatable yet unique. Each track seamlessly follows the next, spinning clever lyrics and brisk guitars, and each adds another deft chapter to this memorable volume.

“The distinctive sound we are reaching for is rock and roll. We don't use any instruments in our songs that we don’t play live, we are going for a very raw and real sound for this record,” Kitlas said. When noted that shared influences range from Third Eye Blind to Red Hot Chili Peppers, it’s even more apparent where the EP’s driving and fully-executed rock-based energy gained its roots.
The easy nature and chemistry of the band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2003 is more than just a cosmic luck for an emerging band. Because this, in years of formation, is by no means a freshman band. Echeverria and Kitlas became friends in grade school, and continued to grow up experiencing many life-changing events together, securing a bond that eventually extended to music, and a decision to make it their ultimate ambition. The band signed to Hopeless Records before they even received their high school diplomas.
More than just a sum of its parts, the writing process for Anarbor is a group united, with each member adding input in acoustic jam sessions that allows everyone to collaborate and contribute creatively. It’s a cohesion that allowed each member’s personal preferences and talents shine when it came to recording.

Sharing the stage with everyone from Fall Out Boy to the Gin Blossoms, as well as a coveted spot on this year’s Take Action! Tour, Anarbor is gaining steady recognition as the diverse band to watch among a sea of faux rock ‘n rollers. This motivated and utterly gifted band will resonate with any listener who knows a thing or two about learning who you are and putting your ambitions into motion.
“We want people to walk away feeling comforted and confident in themselves,” Kitlas said. “Music is a universal language that everyone can relate to. We talk about our real life stories, feelings and situations. You can expect real music and real lyrics, no filler.”

More recently, Anarbor independently released their eponymous third studio album entitled, “Anarbor” in June of 2016. The album was self-funded and produced by long-time collaborator Matt Keller (Lydia, The Maine, The Summer Set, Katastro). Anarbor is comprised of lead vocalist and bassist Slade Echeverria, guitarist Adam Juwig and guitarist Danny Stravers.

He recruited guitarists Eric Cutler and Danny Coralles and bassist Ken Sorvari. In 1988 they released the demo ""Critical Madness"" and got signed to Peaceville records. Two years later they released their debut album ""Severed Survival"". The album also featured bass tracks from Steve DiGiorgio of Sadus.

In 1991 the band released two EP's, ""Fiend for Blood"" and ""Retribution for the Dead"" and an LP named ""Mental Funeral"". None of these seemed to help the band, nor did the third full-length ""Acts of the Unspeakable"", which also featured the new bassist Josh Barohn (formerly of Suffocation). Nevertheless the album was well-known for it's disturbing coverart. 

Nothing really happened with the band until 1995 where they released the album ""Shitfun"" which had another new bassist, Freeway Migliore. After the release the band split up and moved on to other projects, most notably [a252866]. 

In 2001 the compilation album ""Torn from the Grave"" was released.

Upon the 20th anniversary re-release of Autopsy's ""Severed Survival"" album the band temporarily reformed for a short time to record two newly written songs which were released as the ""Horrific Obsession"" 7"" and were also included on the 20th anniversary edition of ""Severed Survival"". Shortly after these recordings Clint Bower left Abscess and the remaining members decided to split up and reunite with original member Eric Cutler as Autopsy again. The band wrote material for a new album which will see a 2011 release and a 5-track EP named ""The Tomb Within"" which was released in September 2010 on [l14465].

17479,25526,501472,US,Bad Religion,How Could Hell Be Any Worse?,1982,0.0,14,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Hardcore', 'Punk']","Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.

All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split.

Originally from the Seattle area.

In 2006, Jared and Coady were asked to join the [a87652] who were once again without a bass player after Kevin Rutmanis had been added to the bassist morgue. Jared took over the bass duties while Coady played a second drum kit along with Dale Crover.  They recorded (A) Senile Animal in July 2006, and started a U.S. tour in September with Big Business, among others, opening up. During these shows they were sometimes joined by Melvins drummer Dale Crover on guitar.  They stayed on with the Melvins to record two more albums, Nude With Boots and The Bride Screamed Murder.  After this time, Melvins and Big Business started slowly separating ways, while still occasionally playing live shows together, as the Melvins began experimenting with other bassists in a three-piece arrangement, first attempting Melvins Lite with Trevor Dunn on stand-up bass.

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".

They socialized with the St. Louis punk/hard-core scene, including members of Drunks with Guns and Ultraman. The band later moved to Brooklyn, NY, after signing a contract with SST Records, headed by Greg Ginn of Black Flag. Ginn signed the band after hearing their self-produced cassette demo, which was passed around by fans in St. Louis.

Though at its core heavy metal, Blind Idiot God's music was informed by punk, dub, and classical music composers György Ligeti and Igor Stravinsky. In a 1997 Guitar Player interview, Hawkins reports, ""When I listen to a lot of metal and hard rock, I think 'Great Intensity! Boring chords!'""

Blind Idiot God have recently resumed activity after a long hiatus (with Tim Wyskida of Khanate replacing Epstein) and have played a few shows in the New York/Brooklyn area within the last 6 months. Apparently, they are going to record new material in the near future.

The phrase ""blind idiot god"" comes from the works of H. P. Lovecraft, where the god Azathoth is described as such."

The band was formed in Colchester in December 1989 as [a=Seymour] but was renamed Blur in March 1990, after they'd signed for the Food label. Blur's early releases (the Leisure album and the singles off it) were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of ""baggy"" bands from the Madchester scene and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, at times reminding of Syd Barrett. Tthis was more readily apparent on several single B-sides where the group let loose a darker side.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music (e.g. The Kinks or XTC) or even nostalgic music from World War II. Their 2nd album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) had moderate success but began attracting attention for its Britishness but in hindsight it rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, with groups like [a=Suede] early frontrunners too. In 1994 Blur released what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album: Parklife. 1995's The Great Escape was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. 

When the 5th studio album Blur came out in 1997, the group had reinvented their sound. They severed ties from Britpop and reincorporated the art rock experimentalism of their early years, only this time the music was informed by a broader range of influences (e.g. Pavement). The album's second song Song 2 was released as a single and became a hit on alternative dancefloors. Subsequent albums 13 and Think Tank further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe.

After 13 and the subsequent tours, the band took a pause and its members pursued personal projects. In 1998 Albarn started the [a6378] project, Alex James engaged in [a120885] with Damien Hirst, and Graham Coxon released his first solo album the same year. Over the years Coxon had started struggling with alcoholism and when Blur started the recording sessions for Think Tank, it came to a point where they asked him to no longer be present. After its release in 2003 the band went on full hiatus until December 2008, when it was announced the band would reunite for concerts in London's Hyde Park (released as All The People) followed by a series of major concerts e.g. at Glastonbury 2009. The next year saw the release of a a documentary about the band ([url=https://www.discogs.com/master/898685-Blur-No-Distance-Left-To-Run]No Distance Left To Run[/url]) and of the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/241338-Blur-Fools-Day]Fool's Day[/url] single for RSD 2010.

In July 2012 a career spanning box set was released titled [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/460605-Blur-Blur-21-The-Box]Blur 21[/url], and in August 2012 the band headlined a show in Hyde Park for the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics (released as [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/500654-Blur-Parklive]Parklive[/url]). Earlier that year the band had tried to record a studio album with [a2728] as producer but that was aborted. In Autumn 2012 the band again paused its activities.

Early 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album: The Magic Whip. It had been created in 5 days in Hong Kong after a Japan tour that was cancelled in 2013. Following the Magic Whip tour the band went into hiatus again ... resurfacing in 2023 with their 9th studio album The Ballad Of Darren and a series of concerts. In April 2024 Albarn stated that their performance at Coachella was probably the band’s “last gig”. On 19 July 2024 a second documentary titled To The End opened in UK and Irish cinemas, as directed by Toby L.

In the summer of 1994, [a572343], another Chicago-area native, joined the band as lead vocalist.  Shortly afterwards, Pete Havranek, unhappy with the band's musical direction, left the group. The band had been planning on recording their first EP when Pete left, and the covers had been printed prior to the recording so he was credited on the first pressing despite not actually playing on the record. With Pete's departure, Chris stepped away from being the full-time lead singer and picked up the guitar.
In mid-1999, the band announced their impending break-up, playing their last shows in the summer of 1999, hitting Champaign, Chicago, and Milwaukee (the hometowns of all the members).

[a=Daniel Buettner] (bass), was in [a=Ordination of Aaron] (Kalamazoo). [a=Derek Brosch] (drums) was in [a=Current (3)], [a=Ottawa], and [a=Gregor (11)] (Detroit).

Charles and Ryan started with very short lived band Fire Sale in the early nineties. They didn't do much. Put out a demo tape, made a small line-up change, and changed their name to [a=Vine (4)]. Vine was Kalamazoo's first ""emo"" band. Very highly adored locally, but also didn't do much beyond releasing a demo tape and 7"".

Meanwhile, [a=Ordination of Aaron] was about to call it quits, so Dan hooked up with Chuck, who was already writing songs with some drummer. The three of them played a few times before the drummer decided he wasn't into it, so Chuck and Dan began searching for a replacement drummer. They tried playing with nearly every local drummer they knew, but nobody was quite the right fit. Dan finally talked [a=Derek Brosch] into playing drums for them. He was in a band called [a=Current (3)], which played with [a=Ordination of Aaron] quite a bit. He lived in Detroit, which was about 3 hours away, so he was unsure about traveling every weekend to Kalamazoo for practice.

The three of them auditioned a number of singers, none of which really wanted to do it, and none were what they were looking for anyway. Chuck and Ryan happened to be living together at that time. Ryan was in his final days of college, intern teaching at a local high school, so his main focus was on that, and not music. Chuck talked him into checking them out, and he agreed to be in the band for the time being, as he was thinking of moving out of state (to Denver) after school was over.

The name derived from a photo of James Dean that Ryan had scribbled ""Broken Hearts Are Blue"" on it and hung on his bedroom door. They had thought about several names, mostly with the word ""Blue"" in it, and finally just went with BHAB.

Every weekend Derek would drive 3 hours to Kalamazoo for practice. He'd show up Friday night, they'd play all day Saturday, and for about 3-4 hours every Sunday before he went back to Detroit. The band did this every weekend for about a year. It should be noted that during the band Chuck moved to Columbus, Ohio to attend graduate school, and would drive to Detroit two weekends a month for practice.

Thus, BHAB was formed in the fall of 1995, played a handful of shows in the Midwest throughout 1996, with [a=Wallside], [a=Franklin (2)], [a=Constantine Sankathi], [a=Spirit Assembly], [a=The Locust], [a=Braid], [a=Julia (17)], [a=Guyver-One], [a=Boy Sets Fire], and many others.

As far as the music writing goes, Chuck wrote most of the music, but the band arranged it collectively. Ryan wrote all his own lyrics.

Record session was in Western Sound Studios at Western Michigan University in 1996. The full-length album, titled [m=127000], was released in early 1997 on [l=Caulfield Records] of Lincoln, Nebraska. Song ""525 To Heart"" was recorded during the [m=127000] session, but never made onto the LP. [a=Bryan Charles] is a musician and close friend of the band, and happened to be in the studio with the band the day they were recording. His participation on the record was a spur of the moment kind of thing. He sang backup vocals on ""Last Night's Tattoo.""

Later 4 or 5 songs had been dialed in but the band broke up before they could get into another studio.

They played their final performance in March of 1997 at the Michigan Festival. Ryan only decided to move to Denver about a month prior to band final show in March. It was a quick decision to relocate but Chuck was living in Columbus, Ohio and Derek was in Detroit so it would have been difficult at the very least to continue as a band even if Ryan had not moved to Denver.

Ryan and Chuck haven't been in any other bands or music projects since BHAB. Ryan moved back to Kalamazoo after living in Denver for a few years, and is now a librarian. Chuck has a Ph.D in special education, and currently lives in Charlotte, NC and teaches at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Derek is systems engineer and now lives in Los Angeles. Daniel is art teacher. Derek Brosch played in [a=Fastpass]. [a=Daniel Buettner] played in [a=The Hidden Chord]."

Formed in a squat in Leeds, England, in 1982, Chumbawamba released their first single, ""Revolution"", in 1985. Up to a point they self-released most of their material on labels they ran themselves, such as [l74128] and [l22496]. Their musical style has changed through the years, initially a shouting punk band, later recording some folk songs, then, with the ""Jesus H Christ"" album, they discovered electronic music. 

That album, however, was built around numerous samples of other groups and, when they found out how much clearing them would cost, they scrapped it (though, it was released as a bootleg and, in recent years, via their chumbawamba.tv site as mp3s) and rerecorded the album without the samples and with a new focus on censorship. 

""Anarchy"" was their response to criticism from their contemporaries for their move into pop music, funny, political and musically experimental. The anti-Nazi song ""Enough is Enough"", recorded with regular collaborator MC Fusion, was released as a single and launched Fusion's new group Credit to the Nation. They had minor chart success, but nothing compared to what was to come. 

The disappointing ""Swingin' with Raymond"" followed and was the end of their relationship with One Little Indian. Deciding that there's no such thing as a good capitalist, big or small, they signed with EMI, whom they had criticised in the past. The band were heavily criticised once again, but the massive worldwide success of ""Tubthumper"" allowed the band to fund numerous political campaigns around the world. 

They were never to repeat the success of that single and proudly proclaimed themselves one hit wonders and their relationship with EMI only lasted one more album and a few singles. Independent again with Mutt Records, and with long-time producer Neil Ferguson now officially a member, they have continued to experiment with their style, recording ""Readymades"", mixing folk samples with dance beats, the soundtrack to the Alex Cox film ""Revengers Tragedy"" and their latest release, ""UN"", recorded on a mini disc in Latin America and at Chumbawamba's Bradford studio, mixing styles and sounds from different parts of the world.

Since then, the group slimmed down to just Lou, Neil, Boff and Jude, and added Phil Moody on accordion to play folk music with pop influences. The other members have moved on to their own projects.  

Always controversial, often under attack from the left and the right, Chumbawamba have always done things their own way and, in their own words, ""Never do what you are told."" 

In August 2012 the band decided to call it quits after some final gigs in their 30th year of existence mainly because ""the rest of our lives got in the way and we couldn’t commit the time and enthusiasm that the band demanded.""

Formed in a squat in Leeds, England, in 1982, Chumbawamba released their first single, ""Revolution"", in 1985. Up to a point they self-released most of their material on labels they ran themselves, such as [l74128] and [l22496]. Their musical style has changed through the years, initially a shouting punk band, later recording some folk songs, then, with the ""Jesus H Christ"" album, they discovered electronic music. 

That album, however, was built around numerous samples of other groups and, when they found out how much clearing them would cost, they scrapped it (though, it was released as a bootleg and, in recent years, via their chumbawamba.tv site as mp3s) and rerecorded the album without the samples and with a new focus on censorship. 

""Anarchy"" was their response to criticism from their contemporaries for their move into pop music, funny, political and musically experimental. The anti-Nazi song ""Enough is Enough"", recorded with regular collaborator MC Fusion, was released as a single and launched Fusion's new group Credit to the Nation. They had minor chart success, but nothing compared to what was to come. 

The disappointing ""Swingin' with Raymond"" followed and was the end of their relationship with One Little Indian. Deciding that there's no such thing as a good capitalist, big or small, they signed with EMI, whom they had criticised in the past. The band were heavily criticised once again, but the massive worldwide success of ""Tubthumper"" allowed the band to fund numerous political campaigns around the world.

Since then, the band's musical style has gradually evolved to encompass a wide variety of influences including death, black, gothic and heavy metal. The band's lyrics and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, mythology, occultism, and horror films and have both drawn a fair amount of controversy over the course of their career. The exact sub-genre the band plays is difficult to classify and is often a subject of debate.

The band formed in 1968. Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some band members believe that their music cannot be categorised as belonging to any one genre. They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as ""the loudest pop group"", and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

There has been a Deep Purple band in existence since the late 60s, apart from the eight years between 1976 when Mark IV split up and 1984 when Mark II reformed. 

Deep Purple were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

Formed in 1996 and no longer active. Dekapitator started as an idea between Matt Hellfiend, Dan Bulldoze and Andy Maniac in the mid-90s. Their vinyl collections were growing, as was their distaste for modern metal. On a mission to destroy false-thrash Black Metal spinoff bands, Hellfiend and Bulldoze started auditioning different drummers in '96, until Andy came back into the picture to complete the thrashing trio. The trio recorded their split 7"" with Nunslaughter in the winter of 96/97 and played shows with Dark Funeral, Birthright, Lord Weird Slough Feg, and many other local metal acts, as well as the San Bernadino Metalfest, sandwiched between the Haunted and The Ravenous. The band then recorded their debut album ""We Will Destroy... You Will Obey"" in 1999 with guitar guru James Murphy. Shortly thereafter Dekapitator sought to add a second guitarist, first bringing in Wes Blackwulf, who was later replaced by Brad Attitude, which also didn't last, leaving the band as a trio once again. Dekapitator continued to play throughout the Bay Area, including supporting slots for Exodus and Thor, among others. Upon reconvening a couple of years ago to get things rolling again, the band recruited new guitarist D. Attacker. Dekapitator began writing for their next full-length and playing out again. In 2007 the band completed work on said full-length, ?he Storm Before the Calm? and through a long-standing friendship, joined the Relapse Records roster."

During their spring semester, they began experimenting with samples, recording software and guitars, making music with the atmospheric sweep of symphonic and electronic pop and the intimacy of folk. Initially, Rossen and Nicolaus intended their music to be heard just by their friends, but California indie label Isota Records released the duo's debut EP, Mo' Tussin, in 2002 and The Noam Chomsky Spring Break EP the following year. Those EPs, plus some extra studio records, were compiled to make The Whitey on the Moon UK LP, which Isota also issued in 2003. However, upon discovering a San Francisco band also with the name the Whitey on the Moon, Rossen and Nicolaus changed their project's name to Department of eagles, and the album's name was changed to The Cold Nose and issued in the UK by Melodic in 2005 and reissued in the US with four bonus tracks by American Dust in 2007. Meanwhile, in 2004, Rossen joined Grizzly Bear in time to contribute tracks to their breakthrough album, 2006's Yellow House; that year, Department of Eagles' odds-and-ends EP A Johnny Glaze Christmas: Classical Snatches and Samples a Go-Go was released. During that time, Rossen and Nicolaus continued to work on tracks, gathering enough material for an album by late 2007. Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor and Christopher bear, as well as bassist Nat Baldwin, joined Rossen and Nicolaus for the sessions, which were completed in spring 2008. The resulting album, In Ear Park, was inspired by Rossen's late father and released by 4AD that fall. The odds-and-ends collection Archive 2003-2006, which included tracks from their aborted sophomore album and pieces that were later used by Grizzly Bear, arrived in 2010."
2725,24934,412404,UK,Depeche Mode,Songs Of Faith And Devotion Live,1993,0.0,10,"['LP', 'Album']","['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Alternative Rock', 'New Wave', 'Synth-pop']","English electronic music band formed March 1980 in Basildon, Essex, and named after a popular French fashion magazine. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005) Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981) Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, and chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). 

Depeche Mode released their debut record ""Speak & Spell,"" in 1981, bringing them into the British new-wave scene. Soon after the release of the album, Clarke decided to quit the band, leaving them to record their next album, 1982's ""A Broken Frame,"" as a trio. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, thus establishing a line-up that would continue for the next thirteen years.

1983's groundbreaking ""Construction Time Again,"" and 1984's ""Some Great Reward,"" gained the band extensive popularity in the US. The subsequent releases of 1986's ""Black Celebration,"" and 1987's ""Music for the Masses,"" established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, titled ""101,"" where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. The latter end of the US tour was recorded and released on VHS video, and was titled ""101."" The show itself was recorded and released as a double live album, and carried the same title.

In the new decade, Depeche Mode released 1990's ""Violator,"" which was a massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, 1993's ""Songs of Faith and Devotion,"" and the supporting ""Devotional Tour,"" exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. 

Now a trio once again, the band released ""Ultra,"" in 1997. This album was recorded during the height of Dave Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Martin Gore's alcoholism and seizures, along with Andrew Fletcher's bout with serious depression. For these reasons, there was no worldwide tour for this album. In 1998, the band released ""The Singles 81 > 85,"" which was a re-issue of 1985's ""The Singles 81 → 85."" The latter release contained ""Photographic (Some Bizarre Version)"" & ""Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Remix).""

They also released ""The Singles 86>98,"" and there was a subsequent world tour, titled ""The Singles Tour."" 

The release of 2001's ""Exciter,"" confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful. The ""Exciter Tour,"" was their first tour in support of an original album since 1993. Again, the band did tour in 1998 to support the aforementioned ""The Singles 86–98,"" compilation albums.

Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have to this day sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the world's best-selling music artists. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode ""the most popular electronic band the world has ever known,"" and included the band in the list of the ""50 Bands That Changed the World!"" Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time.""

They were considered one of the pioneering forces in ""math rock"", although the members are said to despise that particular term.  The band's sound was dominated by the ""lead drumming"" of [a=Damon Che] and was noted for its odd-timed rhythms and intricate and complex guitar interplay.  Also of note was guitarist [a=Ian Williams]' guitar-playing, which relied heavily on a finger-tapping approach used for the rhythm playing (there are no solos in Don Caballero's music) and heavy use of a delay pedal.  Despite an appearance to the contrary, the group's songs are not improvised jams but are structured works.

The founding members of the group were Damon Che, bassist [a=Pat Morris], and guitarist [a=Mike Banfield], with Ian Williams joining as second guitarist a year later.  The group signed to [l=Touch And Go] in 1993 for their first LP, ""For Respect"" and remained with the label for 3 more full-length albums, a couple of singles, and one compilation.  Morris left the band after the release of ""For Respect"".  Several bassists rotated in and out of the group, with [a=Matt Jencik] appearing on the group's 2nd LP, ""Don Caballero 2"".  Morris returned for 1998's ""What Burns Never Returns"" but left the group for good after it's release.  He was replaced by [a=Eric Emm], who was a member of Williams' side-project, [a=Storm And Stress].  Mike Banfield left, too, after some touring for the record and was replaced by [a=Jon Fine].  By 2000's ""American Don"", the band was down to a trio.  The album was their last for Touch And Go.  The group split in 2001 following van accident while on tour, although increasing tension within the band, particularly between Che and Williams, contributed heavily to the break-up.

After the split, members wandered off into different groups.  In 2003, Che decided to revive the Don Caballero name.  Although he invited both Mike Banfield and Pat Morris back into the group, he vowed never to work with Ian Williams again.  Banfield and Morris both declined, and Che instead regrouped with members of Creta Bourzia, also from Pittsburgh.  The band signed to [l=Relapse Records] and issued ""World Class Listening Problem"" 2006. ""Punkgasm"" followed in 2008. The band finally came to an end in 2009. "

Punk band from Boston, MA, formed in 1996 by Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar) and Mike McColgan (vocals).  The band is known for its Oi!/punk sound, its frequent covers of Irish standards, and lyrics which often focus on unions and working class ethics and concerns.  In 1998, the band signed to [l=Hellcat Records], a label run by members of [a=Rancid] and connected to [l=Epitaph Records].  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.  The split was amicable and McColgan would return to music a few years later, fronting the [a=Street Dogs].  He was replaced by Al Barr.  Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old [a=Woody Guthrie] poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".  It remains perhaps their best-known song.

In 2007, the Dropkick Murphys formed their own record label, Born & Bred Records, to release their material.

Behold the debut album from Eagle Twin. Although Eagle Twin is a very new entity its helmsman: Gentry Densley is no stranger to innovative, heavy music. Densley was the musical visionary and leader of the legendary jazz, prog, rock, metal, hardcore group Iceburn (aka The Iceburn Collective) from 1991-2001.

Iceburn has been called the greatest and most important musical offering from Salt Lake City since the Osmonds! Gentrys’ playing has been very influential to a lot of successful modern music groups such as: Isis, Pelican, Sunn O))) etc...

In order to disseminate his majestic and mountainous riffs in the present day he enlisted massively behemoth skinsman Tyler Smith. The drums are not only a driving force that efficiently steam rolls over you they conjure a repetitious mantra that is eerily infectious.

Although Iceburn was primarily a instrumental force, with Eagle Twin Gentry is much more vocal and the depth of his lyrics is endless. His vocal evocations bring to mind the hoarse rasp of Tom Waits and Howlin Wolf but possibly channeled through Tuvan throat singers. His voice, is used much like an instrument and often times creates a unique drone of its own. The riffs and music definitely have familiar reference points (Caspar Brotzmann Massaker, Earth, Sunn O))), Melvins etc...) but are crafted in a way that stands miles beyond the others.

Formed by guitarist Kirk Hammett & drummer Tom Hunting (who initially handled vocals as well). The group was rounded out by guitarist Tim Agnello and bassist Carlton Melson. The line up shifted several times in the early years.

1982 - 1985

In 1982, Exodus included Kirk Hammett and Gary Holt on guitars, Paul Baloff on lead vocals, Geoff Andrews on bass and drummer Tom Hunting. This lineup recorded the band's 1982 demo.

In 1983, founding member Kirk Hammett left Exodus to join Metallica and was replaced by guitarist Rick Hunolt and Rob McKillop replaced Andrews on bass. This line-up recorded and released their debut album, ""Bonded by Blood"" in 1984 (released in 1985).

1986 - 1991

Shortly before the recording of ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" in 1987, Paul Baloff was replaced by Steve ""Zetro"" Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for the San Francisco band Legacy (later known as Testament). Baloff later went on to form the band [a=Piranha (9)].

In 1989, the band released ""Fabulous Disaster"" which garnered good press and, eventually, a major label deal.  That same year, Tom Hunting departed, leaving the group with no founding members.  In 1991 the band released their first live effort, ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", which featured new bassist Mike Butler.

1991 - 1998

After the release of ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", the band toured sporadically for a year and released another studio album, ""Force of Habit"". This album was a departure for the band, containing several slower, ""heavier"" songs with less emphasis on the speed/thrash basis of their older material.  Unable to match the commercial success of some of their peers and dealing with internal stresses and problems, Exodus split in 1994.

After a few dormant years, Exodus released only another live album in 1997 titled ""Another Lesson in Violence"" and featuring the return of vocalist Paul Baloff and new bassist Jack Gibson. Exodus disintegrated again, partly due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

2001 - 2004

In 2001, Exodus reformed again, initially to play the Chuck Billy benefit, the ""Thrash of the Titans"" mega concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local gigs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. In February 2002, Paul Baloff suffered a seizure/stroke from which he eventually died. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments.

Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004's ""Tempo of the Damned"" released on Nuclear Blast.

2005 - Present

In 2005, Hunolt decided to leave the band to concentrate on his family life. He was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also left, citing strong personal objections over some of Holt's anti-Christian lyrics as well as anxiety issues. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph who had previously played with Forbidden, Slayer and Testament.  Souza also left under disputed terms in 2005. 
He was replaced intitially by Steev Esquivel (ex-Defiance and Skinlab) and then later by Rob Dukes whose first recorded performance for the band is 2005's ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine"". 

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007.  In 2012, Rick Hunolt returned in a guest role, filling in for Gary Holt on several live dates while Holt toured with [a=Slayer].  In 2014, Steve Souza returned to the group. He departed again in January 2025, with Rob Dukes returning as vocalist.

Phil Vane (vocals), Dean Jones (vocals), Pete Hurley (guitar), Jerry Clay (bass) and 'Pig Killer' (drums) formed Extreme Noise Terror back in 1985 in Ipswich, England as a heavy Hardcore Punk band.
This lineup released the Radioactive Earslaughter split album with Chaos UK
Jerry Clay was soon replaced by Mark Gardener (Sarcasm)
Pig Killer quit and was replaced by Mick Harris (Napalm Death)

Mark Gardener was evicted and replaced by Pete Nash (Doom)
Phil Vane was next to quit and was replaced by Spit
Spit's stay was short and he was replaced by the returning Vane
Pete Nash quit and was replaced by Mark Bailey (Filthkick)
The lineup of Jones/Vane/Hurley/Stick/Bailey proved the most stable in the bands volatile history - Recordings by this lineup included Peel Session No3, Phonophobia, a re-recording of 'Holocaust In Your Head' (Released on CD) plus various tracks recorded for compilation albums

The collaboration with KLF was the beginning of the end for ENT as a Punk band - During this period ENT stopped working on their own material - When KLF 'retired' ENT had no money to continue and no new material to record - This lead to the band merging with Dean Jones side project Raw Noise - Stick was replaced by Raw Noise drummer (and original ENT drummer) Pig Killer, Ali Firouzbakht joined on lead guitar.

The style of ENT's music began to change as they attempted to write material which would make money instead of the crust/grind style they were known for - The new material was slower and borrowed heavilly from bands such as GISM, Ministry and Pitch Shifter - The 'Witness To The Persecution' tour of Germany previewed this new style for the first time and was not well received by the fans
The new sound combined with internal disharmonies lead to the departures firstly of Bailey (replaced by Lee Barrett of Disgust) and later of Hurley (who was not replaced)

From this point on ENT became a death metal band bearing little resemblence either in style or lineup to it's roots in hardcore punk as members of Cradle of Filth and Napalm Death joined with Extreme Noise Terror to create the reborn group that would release ""Damage 381"" in 1997. 

From mid 2010's the band started to release vinyl closer to what fans consider their true sound, with releases such as the Hatred and the Filth EP,  a split EP with Japanese band Slang, and a full length release, that sounded closest to their original sound for a long time.

The band is known for their controversial lyrics, which are, at times, sexist and/or homophobic, though this is usually meant more to be shocking than it is to be taken seriously.  Following the release of their first single, drummer Spit Stix and guitarist Philo Cramer joined the band and, for many, this constituted the ""classic"" Fear line-up.  The band's reputation grew after appearances in the movie ""[m=652828]"" (where they antogonized a San Francisco crowd nearly to the point of riot) and on a 1981 episode of ""[l468333]"" (where they appeared at the insistence of [a=John Belushi]; the band brought their own slam dancers and eventually the network cut away from the band mid-performance; for years, the episode remained one of their few SNL episodes that NBC refused to re-run).  

After the release of their first LP, ""[m=109623]"", in 1982, Ving fired Scratch and the band went through a number of bass players, including [a=Flea] of [a=Red Hot Chili Peppers] fame (this line up, however, did not release any material).  In 1993, Spit Stix and Philo Cramer quit the band after a financial dispute with Lee Ving. Ving returned in 1995 with a new line-up and a new Fear album.  A follow-up record appeared in 2001.  Ving continued to tour under the Fear banner with drummer [a=Andrew Jaimez] (who joined in 1995) and a number of different guitarists and bassists. In 2018, in celebration of the band’s 40th anniversary, Spit Stix and Philo Cramer returned to the band."

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988.

The bands fictional back story is:
For millions of years, the mythical galactic monsters of GWAR lay frozen in an iceberg in Antarctica. But in the 1980, glam rock was at its peak, groups like Poison and Whitesnake were dominating the airwaves. They inspired a whole slew of new ""hair spray"" bands. But little did they know, all of that hair spray put a hole in the ozone - right above Antarctica! Soon the unfiltered gamma rays melted the iceberg and GWAR was free.

Meanwhile, manager Sleazy P. Martini was fleeing the country on drug charges, flying over the former tomb of GWAR. He picked them up and brought them back to America. He taught them how to use instruments and they learned the language from watching midget wrestling and MTV. Soon GWAR was known as the greatest band in the Universe..."

In the eighties, his compositions for the Glenn Branca Ensemble included the several symphonies for which he was best known. Branca's compositions centered around multiple guitars - four or more, heavily amplified - augmented by a rock-based rhythm section of drums and bass. In later works, the composer began adding other instruments, including mallet guitar, keyboards, and occasionally a second drummer. Branca's minimalist compositions frequently required unusual guitar tunings.

Gustafson left before the recording of their first LP, Grimaldi was replaced by Jason Viebrooks, and the band went on to record two albums of groove-thrash metal in the early Machine Head vein with that line-up.
After the second album ""Nemesis"" was released in 1997, Viebrooks also left, and was replaced by Canadian bassist Stuart Carruthers for the recording of their third album ""Solidify"" (1999), before more or less naturally dissolving since the members were involved in other activities.

At this point, Lombardo is concentrating on the Fantomas project, and Sorychta has been busy producing bands like Tiamat, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering. 

The band never really disappeared though, and in 2004 they released a new album called ""Incorporated"" with Sorychta filling in on bass duties.

Terry recruited bassist Derek Peace and drummer Jim Kovach, reuniting a trio that had last played together in a cover band a few years earlier. During this time they called themselves Sapien. Derek introduced vocalist Corey Rivers to the project, bringing two songs from their previous band, Helm's Deep (""Hands of Destiny"" and ""Tear Down the Walls""). During the next 4 months under the name of [a=Nemesis (92)], most of the material that would later end up on the Graceful Inheritance album would be conceived. In February 1984, Corey Rivers left the band to concentrate on his career, and vocalist Paul Davidson was recruited for the album recordings that had been scheduled for that summer (Terry and Paul had played in a cover band in 1980 under the name Renegade). This is the point at which Terry Gorle changed the band name to Heir Apparent."

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

Singer/guitarist John Tran (stage name Johnee Trash/John E. Trash), singer/guitarist Ian ""Slur"" Cone, and drummer Bob ""Stress"" Herco met while classmates at El Modena High School in Orange, and formed Home Grown shortly after graduating. Adding singer/bassist Adam ""Adumb"" Lohrbach (who had attended Estancia High School in nearby Costa Mesa), they released their debut 7"" EP [i]Smoking Is Cool[/i] in 1994 on Insta-Noise Records. Their first full-length album, [i]That's Business[/i], was released in 1995 on local label Liberation Records. It was given an overseas release in Europe and Sweden in 1996 by Burning Heart Records, who also released their EP [i]Wusappaning?![/i] the same year (a U.S. release of the EP came in 1998 on Cargo Music/Grilled Cheese). The band's early sound was heavily influenced by ska-punk, leading to their inclusion on a number of punk- and ska-themed compilations.

Home Grown signed to major label Outpost Recordings, who released their second album, [i]Act Your Age[/i] (1998). A new recording of the [i]That's Business[/i] song ""Surfer Girl"" was released as the album's single. Cone left the band after the album's release, and was replaced by Justin Poyser. That December, Herco had surgery to remove a brain tumor. He underwent rehabilitation, was able to tour, and played on the 1999 EP [i]EP Phone Home[/i], released on Fueled By Ramen. However, he did not play on Home Grown's 2000 split EP with [a=Limbeck] on Utility Records, titled [i]Connection[/i] (Tran played drums on one track, while Poyser played on the other two). He left the band that September, citing complications from his surgery. Darren Reynolds of [a=Longfellow] was recruited to fill in for a tour that began the following month. A few dates into the tour, Poyser quit the group over personal differences, reducing them to a trio. Reynolds' membership became permanent by early 2001, but Outpost Recordings folded, leaving the band without a recording contract.

In June 2001 Home Grown signed with Drive Thru Records, who released their 2002 album [i]Kings Of Pop[/i], which found them leaning fully into a pop punk sound. Shortly after its release, guitarist Dan Hammond (of This Camero) joined the band to play on that summer's Warped Tour, eventually becoming a full time member. [i]Kings Of Pop[/i] was supported by a single and music video for ""You're Not Alone"" and additional videos for ""Kiss Me, Diss Me"" and ""I Love You, Not"". The EP [i]When It All Comes Down[/i] followed in 2004, showing the band maturing musically and lyrically. Lohrbach left Home Grown in April 2005, going on to co-found [a=New Years Day]. Home Grown continued as a live act, bringing in bassist Ted Vega, but went on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Tran started a new band called Red Panda, while Reynolds started a band called Defender and Hammond joined [a=Paper Models]."

Their debut single ""Natural Born Bugie"" became a  hit in the UK Singles Chart and was  followed by the album As Safe As Yesterday Is, which rose to number sixteen in the UK album charts. Their second album, Town and Country was released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of USA. This album featured a more acoustic sound and songs written by all four members.

During 1970 Humble Pie switched to A&M Records who released  the album Humble Pie, later that year which alternated between progressive rock and hard rock. In 1971 A&M released Rock On, and a simultaneous release of a Humble Pie concert recorded at the Fillmore East New York, entitled Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore. Rock On and Performance both went gold and the loud and epic ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" was an FM radio hit in the USA, propelling the album up the charts. 

Frampton left after Rockin' the Fillmore was recorded and was replaced by Dave ""Clem"" Clempson. Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasizing Marriott's blues and soul roots. They recorded the album Smokin', along with two singles ""Hot 'n' Nasty"" and ""30 Days in the Hole"". It was the band's most commercially successful record and reached #6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. A&M then realeased Lost and Found which combined two previous  albums as one. Looking for a more authentic R&B sound, Marriott hired three female backing singers, The Blackberries and the more focused Thunderbox was released in 1974 and Street Rats a year later. In 1975, joined by keyboardist Tim Hinkley, Humble Pie played a Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.

During 1979 Steve Marriott revived Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley, adding Bobby Tench vocalist and guitarist from The Jeff Beck Group and American bassist Anthony ""Sooty"" Jones. Fool for a pretty face proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records. They recorded the album On to Victory which was released in 1980 . Humble Pie toured USA as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill and recorded the album Go for the Throat. At the beginning of this tour Marriott crushed his hand, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a duodenal ulcer forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates. Soon afterwards this line up disbanded.

Drummer Jerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1989 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley, Shirley was the only original performing member. The band began performing concerts and was based in Cleveland, Ohio USA. This time the line up included vocalist Charlie Huhn, who also played lead and rhythm guitar. While Huhn and Shirley were the only permanent members of the group several other musicians appeared from time to time including Wally Stocker formerly of Rod Stewart's band and Cleveland guitarist Alan Greene. They developed a strong reputation as a live act in USA but never released any official studio recordings. They  appeared in the line-up at the Woodstock Festival's 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was broadcast live on national television in the United States and other countries. 

During 1991 when it had appeared that a reunion featuring Frampton and Marriott would happen, Shirley put Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley on hold. After Marriott's death Shirley revived his band which dissolved in 1999. He re-formed Humble Pie again in 2001 with a line up including the original bass player Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench and a new rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell. They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album Back on Track, which comprised new songs and was released by Sanctuary in 2002. A brief tour of UK and Germany with Company of Snakes followed. 

Humble Pie appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the London Astoria during 2001. The concert featured a one of re-union line up of Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley. 

Shirley's 2001 version of the band dissolved in 2002 when Greg Ridley fell ill."

Israel or 'Iz' is the most popular and legendary artist that came from Hawaii and never seem to be forgotten by the citizens.

He died 26th June 1997 of heart failure due to his massive body weight of over 900 pounds (400 Kilos). Today, 'Somewhere over the rainbow' is widely used in commercials and movies and is still popular over 10 years after since that rainy day in California where people heard it on the radio for the first time. And the album 'Facing Future' has sold over 1 million on worldwide basis.

Died: 04 October 1970, Los Angeles, California, USA.

[b]Joplin[/b] was the eldest of her siblings [a3565868] and [a3565870], and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where she began painting and listening to blues artists [a=Bessie Smith], [a=Leadbelly], [a=Big Mama Thornton] and [a=Odetta] with the other rebellious kids in her neighborhood. She graduated high school in 1960, and in 1962, she quit university in the middle of her studies. The university then ran the headline, ""She Dares To Be Different"" in the student newspaper.

She went to San Francisco in 1963, first living in North Beach and later, Haight-Ashbury, where she begun the drug and alcohol habits that would tragically end her life. During this period, she recorded a session with [a=Jorma Kaukonen] that later appeared as the bootleg ""The Typewriter Tape"". Noticeably suffering from her addictions, she returned to Port Arthur in May 1965 and 'straightened up' for a year, enrolling as a sociology major at Lamar University.

In 1966, at the invitation of [a=Chet Helms] whom she'd known as a teenager, she returned to California and was recruited as the singer for [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] in June, appearing at the [l=Avalon Ballroom] in San Francisco during her first public performance with them. In August 1966, the group signed with [l=Mainstream Records] and recorded an album. However, it was not released until a year later and in the meantime, with very little reward, they moved with the [a=Grateful Dead] to a house in Lagunitas, California. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drug use.

Joplin and the band signed with [a=Albert Grossman] in November 1967 and released [r559560] in 1968. This release was the culmination of a year in which Joplin had wowed audiences at the Monterey Pop Festival, the Anderson Theater in New York, the Wake For Martin Luther King Jr concert with [a=Jimi Hendrix] in New York and on TV's prime-time Dick Cavett Show. Joplin then left the band after a Family Dog benefit gig in December 1968 and formed a back-up group, the [a=Kozmic Blues Band], releasing an album in September 1969. The group disbanded three months later, with Joplin again suffering from her addictions.

After taking time out in Brazil with close friend Linda Gravenites (wife of Bay Area musician [a=Nick Gravenites] from 1962-1970), who was her costume designer and praised by Joplin in the May 1968 issue of Vogue, Joplin returned to America and formed the [a=Full Tilt Boogie Band], which began touring in May 1970. She also appeared in reunion concerts with [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] at this time. She then began recording a new album in September 1970 with producer [a=Paul A. Rothchild].

By Saturday, October 3rd Joplin had already laid down a number of takes at [l=Sunset Recording Studios] in LA, including ""Mercedes Benz"". On the following day she failed to appear and John Cooke, the road manager of Full Tilt Boogie Band, drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel where Joplin was staying. There he found her dead on the floor of her room, the result of a seizure caused by a heroin overdose.

Joplin was cremated and her ashes scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean. Her unfinished recordings were assembled and the result was the posthumously released [r755239] in 1971. It became the biggest selling album of her career.

Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 (Performer)."

Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1994 (Performer).

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

Jucifer's G. Edgar Livengood and G. Amber Valentine are known for their brutal beauty and fiery intensity on stage and have enjoyed the fruits of their labor as they garner an ever-increasing buzz and the most loyal of fan basses.

Jucifer's first foray in the studio back in 1995 produced songs that would be released on a fan-funded, independently released 7"", Superman B/W Licorice. 1996 saw the duo embarking on their first tour and completing work on their first full-length, Calling All Cars on the Vegas Strip, which didn't see a release until a friend helped fund another independent release in 1998. Calling All Cars..., and the radio singles it produced, caught the attention of Capricorn Records who signed the band 1999 and who would later re-issue Calling All Cars....

The band spent most of '99 writing and recording their Capricorn debut, I Name You Destroyer, and hit the road touring throughout most of 2000 and 2001 in anticipation for its release which wouldn't come for almost two years after its completion. The release of what was to be a 'tour-only' EP, Lambs, did see its release in 2001 but was available in stores as well. 2002 saw the over-due release of I Name You Destroyer. In its wake was a frenzy of critical acclaim and back-breaking touring with Jucifer taking only two months off the entire year.

Jucifer recorded another EP, War Bird, in July of 2003. War Bird would see its release in March of the following year as the band began to compile material for their next full-length. 2004 also saw the release of the band's first home video / DVD, A Partridge In A Pear Tree via AmberVillain Films. The band continued to work on their next full-length, If Thine Enemy Hunger in between performing regularly throughout 2005.

In April of 2006, Jucifer inked a deal with Relapse Records with If Thine Enemy Hunger being their debut release for the label. In 2007, Jucifer finally realized their desire to write and record a double LP worth? of songs based on the French Revolution. This album, L?utrichienne, focuses mainly on French Queen Marie Antoinette, who was executed by guillotine at the height of the revolution, and her relationship with Louis XVI. L?utrichienne, Jucifer's sophomore release for Relapse, will see a March 18th 2008 North American release date, March 24th internationally. Livengood and Valentine have domesticated the term road-warriors by becoming road-homemakers. In 2001, the two purchased a Winnebago that would later replace their stick-n-mortar home allowing them to play shows consistently and consecutively throughout North America.

They've played with such diverse artists as VIC CHESNUTT, THE MELVINS, CHIMAIRA, HIGH ON FIRE, MASTODON, MIKE WATT, MAN OR ASTROMAN, DYSRHTHMIA, ROYAL TUX, BURIED INSIDE and many, many more over the course of their 10+ year touring career. The list of bands they have been compared to reads with similar diversity; MINOR THREAT meets THE CARPENTERS, SLAYER to SLEEP, VERUCA SALT to MY BLOODY VALENTINE, sprinkled with a little PIXIES, PORTISHEAD, PANTERA, NIRVANA and NAPALM DEATH.

Chosen by Alternative Press in 2004 as one of the top 100 bands to watch, Jucifer has a rare ability to bring together fans of almost every genre. Their devotion to intensity and disdain for stylistic rules tends to inspire strong reactions. The dichotomy between Jucifer's lulling, melodic passages, high-volume sludge and brutal machine gun off-time (not to mention the contrast of female vocals alternately siren and banshee) may not appeal to those who like hearing the same old rock music recycled again and again. Amber and Edgar bleed doom, pop, noise and majesty.

""Thy Dying Light"" was recorded and was to be released at Head Not Found but the parent company Voices of Wonder refused to release due to the extremity of Judas Iscariot.

Akhenaten moved from America to Germany and recorded ""Of Great Eternity"" which was released in 1997. The following two years he managed to release ""Distant in Solitary Night"" which was recorded back in 1996. He also signed a contract with the American label Red Stream. They had heard his new work ""Heaven in Flames"" and agreed to release it. In 2000 he released the MCD ""Dethroned, Conquered and Forgotten"". 

Same year, a live album ""Under the Black Sun"" was released and a split 7"" EP with Krieg, ""To the Coming Age of Intolerance"" in 2001.

Realizing they are both guitar players, they start a band. The California surf rock craze is in full-swing, so they begin learning the signature surf tunes. They name this band ""The Knight Riders"". Butch and James parents both grew up in the southern US, and with the civil rights movement going strong, the band name was a sarcastic reference to the Klu Klux Klan. This initial line-up consisted of Butch on lead guitar/vocals, James on rhythm guitar, and Greg Mahoney on drums. The band was popular with their high school peers with them often being invited to play at parties. That year The Beatles had their first hit, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and the band decided that they had to keep up with the times by adding Rod Pearce on bass, and Jay Mierly on backing vocals. Greg Mahoney was also replaced by the 15-year old drum prodigy, Mike Lentos.

   The year is 1965. The band manages to secure a recording session at Coast Recorders in San Francisco for the Autumn Records label, with Sly Stone on A&R. A demo is cut with the band playing live in the studio. These recordings were unheard until 2015 when they were released by Break-A-Way Records. The Knight Riders gain notoriety in the Bay Area, most notably in a teen club in San Carlos called ""The Cinnamon Tree"". In early 1966 Rod Pearce is replaced by John Dawson who plays harmonica and sings harmonies along with playing bass. John had already become friends and even sung a few times with Butch And Jay, so they were familiar. Later that year Butch is drafted into the army and sent to Worms, Germany to be a clerk for an officer. Taking the advice from another soldier while on leave, he travels to Ibiza, Spain.

   Butch, now married, corresponds with John about Ibiza, saying that the band must exist in Ibiza, nowhere else. In the meantime, band members are pursuing music in different places. Jay with his brothers Rich and Tom Martin, and John, Mike and James traveling, playing wherever they go. Butch finally returns from the army in 1968, with new song ideas and a drive to get the band going again. Mike Lentos is replaced by Delbert Lang on drums, and the band's name is changed to ""Jungle"". A high school friend of Butch takes the band back to Ibiza in vague plans to record with a European label. After months of no replies from record companies, the band returns to the US on the east coast. Renting a farmhouse in Waitsfield, Vermont, the band takes on it's final lineup. 

   A demo is recorded in November 1969 at Allegro Sound Studios in NYC. Pressing the tapes onto 50 vinyl copies, most in plain black sleeves, band attorney George Seaton uses the demo to land a record deal with Polydor, $30,000 (roughly $220,000 today) for 3 albums in 3 years. However, Butch and Jay leave the band for unexplained reasons, going to Amsterdam and meeting with friends. It is believed that Butch, being shut up in the Army for 2 years had a fear of commitment with Polydor.

   Years later, with the demo and band long forgotten, the Little Indians label acquired an original demo copy and created an unofficial 1997 reissue. The band would likely not be recognized today if not for this reissue, and as such these original Little Indians reissues are highly valued, usually selling for $100-$200. Original first pressings are extremely hard to come by as well, with only 3 known surviving copies, one of which was sold on eBay in 2009 for nearly $3,000."

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin.

Live achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album Throwing Copper, which sold eight million copies in the U.S. The band had a string of hit singles in the mid-1990s including ""Lightning Crashes"", which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. Their last three studio albums fared only moderately well in the U.S., but they continued to enjoy success in the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia, and Brazil.

When touring, Live has used additional musicians, including Ed Kowalczyk's younger brother Adam, British keyboardist Michael ""Railo"" Railton, rhythm guitarist Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon, and guitarist Zak Loy of Alpha Rev, Dames Violent and Mothers Anthem.

On November 30, 2009, Taylor revealed that what had initially been termed a two-year hiatus was more likely the end of the band. An acrimonious split soon occurred, with Kowalczyk leaving the band. However, Live continued with singer Chris Shinn and released the album The Turn in October 2014. Kowalczyk rejoined the band in December 2016 and in 2018 they released a new EP ""Local 717"". In 2022, Kowalcyzk, Gracey and Dahleimer announced that Guitarist Chad Taylor was fired from the band. Currently, Ed Kowalczyk is the only original member in the band."

Led by guitarist Vernon Reid, the bands lineup solidified in the mid-80's w/ Corey Glover (vocals), Will Calhoun (drums) and Muzz Skillings (bass). Stylistically, the band's music is a creative fusion influenced by free jazz, funk, hard rock and heavy metal. Their lyrics range from the personal to the political, in some of the latter cases attacking Eurocentrism and racism in America. 

The band’s debut album, “Vivid,” was released in 1988 on Epic Records. The album reached #6 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and was later certified double platinum by the RIAA. It featured “Cult of Personality,” a #13 hit on the Billboard 200 Singles chart as well as the Top 40 hit, “Glamour Boys.” “Cult of Personality” went on to earn the band their first Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. 

In 1990 the band's second full-length album, “Time's Up,” was released and reached #13 on the Billboard 200 while certifying gold. It won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Album and featured guest appearances by Queen Latifah, Little Richard, Doug E. Fresh, and Maceo Parker. 

Living Colour released the 6-song EP, ""Biscuits"" which coincided with the inaugural Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991.

Skillings left the band in the summer of 1992, replaced by session veteran and Sugarhill Records bass player Doug Wimbish.

“Stain,” their third LP, was released in 1993 by Epic. Reaching #26 on the Billboard 200, the album had a much heavier and aggressive sound, containing elements of thrash metal and industrial music while receiving a Grammy nomination for 'Leave It Alone'.

After a split in 1995, Living Colour returned in December 2000 and began recording “Collideøscope”. Released in 2003, the album featured aggressive lyrics, with many of the songs about the September 11 attacks. It also contained cover versions of AC/DC's “Back in Black” and The Beatles' “Tomorrow Never Knows.” 

Their first release on Megaforce Records, “The Chair in the Doorway,” was issued in 2009 and reached #159 on the Billboard 200 charged by the single 'Behind The Sun'

In 2013, the band celebrated the 25th anniversary of 'Vivid' w/ a world tour crossing North and South Americas, Europe, and Japan, including the Soundwave festival in Australia.

The root of Living Colour's next album, came from a performance of Robert Johnson's ""Preachin' Blues"" at the 100th Anniversary Birthday celebration at the legendary Apollo in New York City. 

Released on September 8, 2017, ‘Shade’ is the sound of a band coming to terms with its shadows and light,” says founder Vernon Reid. “From the blue pulpit of Robert Johnson to the mean red streets of Brooklyn... ‘Shade’ is the next chapter of a unique American journey.” "

The Craving was originally released in 1996, however, it was remastered in 2004 when Dave Mustaine remixed & remastered the Megadeth back catalog. The remaster does not include Lee Ving's original vocal tracks or harmonica parts due to the master tapes being lost. So, instead of tracking down Lee and re-recording his vocals and harmonica, Dave did the vocals and simulated the harmonica on guitar.

The MD in MD.45 is Dave Mustaine's initials backwards and the 45 is Lee Ving's reversed initials in Roman numerals.

Dave Mustaine, wanted to create an album showcasing a different musical style than Megadeth. 

MD.45 History

The first (and only) album released was The Craving in Japan first on May 29, 1996 and in other nations on July 23, 1996.

Almost a decade later, while Capitol Records was releasing remastered versions of Megadeth's back catalog, Dave Mustaine chose to remaster The Craving. According to the liner notes, during the remastering process, it was realized that the vocal track and harmonica track were missing.

To complete the remaster,  Mustaine chose to do the vocals himself and simulate the harmonica parts on the guitar.

Lineup

    * Dave Mustaine - Guitar, Vocals (on remastered)
    * Kelly LeMieux - Bass
    * Jimmy DeGrasso - Drums

Agnostic Front's frontman Roger Miret would let his younger brother, Freddy ""Madball"" Cricien take the microphone on lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows and that is where it started.
Madball's first few gigs consisted of un-used Agnostic Front songs.

Upon founding the band consisted of 
Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and vocalist Freddy Cricien.
After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, would join the band. 

One year later Roger Miret left the band, and was replaced by bassist Hoya Roc — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band to play with.
The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown.

1995 saw the band participating in the N.Y.H.C. Documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29th, 1995 at the now defunct ""Coney Island High"". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year.

The band briefly broke up from early 2001 until late 2002. This lineup of Freddy Cricien, Hoya Roc, Mitts (ex-Skarhead), and Rigg Ross (ex-Hatebreed) began touring and recording at the end of 2002.  In 2004 they released their first output after they broke-up the ""N.Y.H.C. EP"" via small diy labels Thorp (USA) & GSR Records (Europe).

253699,2265,1627335,Europe,Manowar,Gods Of War,2007,0.0,17,['LP'],['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"An American Heavy / Epic Metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly swords and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that ""these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that."" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan ""Death to false metal"".

Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as ""Metal Warriors"", ""Manowarriors"", ""Immortals"" or ""Brothers of Metal"".

""I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?"" - Joey DeMaio, during a 2006 interview with Rock Hard Magazine.

Fighting The World (the band's fifth release) was metal's first full-digital recording

The creation of Gods Of War was not devoid of obstacles. The band was forced to delay its release when, deep into the recording sessions, Logan suffered a devastating injuring after crashing on his prized dirtbike. Logan dislocated his elbow in the accident, an injury so severe it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career. But the guitarist fought back and after months of painful rehabilitation, he boasted he has never played his instrument better. 

During Manowar's career, the band have recorded 10 studio albums; two live albums; five DVDs and countless compilations.

Manowar's many innovations include:
* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers
* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles
* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra
* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and their own guitars as well
* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions)

Manowar created Magic Circle Music.

McLuhan was a concept and a mixed-media group where no particular musical venue or style would necessarily prevail. The creator of the idea was David Wright who composed most of the music and wrote the lyrics on their only album, Anomaly.

Paul Cohn was a friend and fellow-student of David Wright at UICC (University of Illinois Chicago). He was also a sax, flute and clarinetist in a week-end prom group called the Seven Seas. When the band lost their trumpeter he asked his friend who he knew could play, to fill in. Soon after the group had a falling apart thing with the singer and guitar player who had big plans and wanted to be stars etc...

So after the two stars had walked-out, David introduced the remains of the group to the McLuhan concept. The idea was to try different things in performances including special sound effects such as baby's crying, various weird instruments, background sounds, playing old movies during their performance (""Monster Bride"" was actually Bride of Frankenstein and in live performance they would turn on the movie at the point where the 20th Century Fox theme is played). The medium was the message"", not the content. Labels didn't matter

""The Wise-Fools Pub"" on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago hired McLuhan to perform every Monday night and they developed a small local following. Their performance got really thight at Wise Fools, and eventually it led to a Brunswick Record contract.

McLuhan only was together for about 1 to 1 ½ years. And they never had a live performance promoting their album, because the very last thing they did was producing Anomaly. It got some obscure radio play but it was ""dead"" as far as the band knew.

Anomaly's concept and ideas now sounds advanced for its time of release (1970). Uniquely american artrock in a brassy and groovy kind of way. Over the years its become cult album, but its never been re-released.

Believe it or not, but the band is still around (2024). Two founding members (NEAL ROSNER - bass, vocals and PAUL COHN - woodwinds) collected a few talented musicians from their home area to regularly play the  ANOMALY-album in its entirety plus a few classic 70s rock songs in saturday matinee shows @MONTROSE SALOON in CHICAGO/ILLINOIS.   https://www.facebook.com/paul.cohn.7/videos/3417486725182877"

Tommy Lee announced that he is reforming Methods of Mayhem, and would start recording in March 2009.

While an official touring line-up still has yet to be confirmed, it is known that each of these members have contributed to the latest album. A live performance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno saw Morgan Rose (of Sevendust) playing drums, with DJ Aero on Turntables, J3 on guitar and vocals, and Tommy Lee on vocals and guitar. There was no bass player present. Methods of Mayhem recently have been signed to Loud & Proud/Roadrunner Records.

The band has gone through countless line-ups and many former members have gone on to become significant figures in a variety of musical scenes.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles.

Many of their songs are about sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock & roll. Their musical style mixes hard rock, punk rock, Southern metal and psychobilly. Much of their music is not what would be considered traditionally ""radio friendly"", due to their frequent use of expletives and vulgar terminology. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to ""Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"" on the Double Live Gonzo album.

The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced ""Rider Sighs""), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) left after the album High as Hell, to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band C'mon) for the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some.

The group was led by Justin ""Slade The Leveller"" Sullivan (b. 1956, Buckinghamshire, England; guitar, vocals), a former platform sweeper and Mars bar production-line worker, with the help of Stuart Morrow (b. 1966, Bradford, England)  on bass guitar and Phil Tomkins on drums. Within a few months, Tompkins had been replaced on drums by Rob Waddington, and this line-up remained unchanged until the summer of 1982, when Waddington left the band and was replaced by Robert ""Robb"" Heaton (b. 1962, Cheshire, England d. Nov. 4th, 2004), a former drum technician and occasional drummer for the band Hawkwind. This line-up remained together until Morrow left the band for personal reasons, during the band's ""No Rest"" tour, the day after a concert in their home town of Bradford. Which was coincidentally the day of the Bradford disaster, May 11th, 1985  He was replaced on bass in the summer by Jason ""Moose"" Harris (b. 1968).

Their brand of punk folk/rock attracted a loyal cult following, much of which shared the band's grievances towards the Tory government policies of the 80s. This was best executed on their debut album, which combined militant themes such as ""Spirit Of The Falklands"" and ""Vengeance"" (a vitriolic anthem about getting even with one's trespassers) with the haunting lament for childhood, ""A Liberal Education"". The group's championing of traditional working-class ethics saw an unexpected boost for a dying art and trade - that of the clog.

New Model Army made their first public appearance at Scamps Disco in Bradford in October 1980. After releasing singles on Abstract Records, enjoying a number 2 UK independent chart hit with ""The Price"" in 1984, they formed an unlikely alliance with the multinational EMI Records, which saw the band acquire a higher profile and a significantly increased recording budget. 

They eventually broke through to a wider audience with ""No Rest"", which peaked at number 28 on the UK singles chart in 1985 - a position they were never to beat in an impressive run of 12 UK chart singles between 1985 and 1991. With often inflammatory lyrics, the band have never compromised their beliefs for commercial gain. 

They ran into trouble with BBC Television's Top Of The Pops show for donning T-shirts with the (albeit laudable) slogan, ""Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin"". This attracted some derision from ""anarcho-punk"" traditionalists [a251960], who replied with their own motif: ""Only Stupid Bastards Help EMI"". They subsequently continued to release high-quality albums, with considerable crossover potential, always maintaining credibility with their original fanbase. 

In December 1991 the group left EMI, eventually finding a new home on Epic Records. Their first single for the label revealed few concessions to the mainstream: ""Here Comes The War"" featured a picture of a charred body, and a pull-out poster instructing the user in how to prepare a nuclear bomb. In 1994, a dance remix of ""Vengeance' was released as a protest against the Criminal Justice Bill. After a lengthy absence the band reconvened for 1998's ""Strange Brotherhood"". New Model Army's short spell with Epic ended as quickly as it started with the band preferring to self publish and go back to their roots. By 2000 their most recent studio album was ready. Named ""Eight"" it included a now familiar, though no less effective, formula and energy. They continue to release new material and tour as of 2023."

Their brand of punk folk/rock attracted a loyal cult following, much of which shared the band's grievances towards the Tory government policies of the 80s.

New Model Army made their first public appearance at Scamps Disco in Bradford in October 1980. After releasing singles on Abstract Records, enjoying a number 2 UK independent chart hit with ""The Price"" in 1984, they formed an unlikely alliance with the multinational EMI Records, which saw the band acquire a higher profile and a significantly increased recording budget. 

They eventually broke through to a wider audience with ""No Rest"", which peaked at number 28 on the UK singles chart in 1985 - a position they were never to beat in an impressive run of 12 UK chart singles between 1985 and 1991. With often inflammatory lyrics, the band have never compromised their beliefs for commercial gain. 

They ran into trouble with BBC Television's Top Of The Pops show for donning T-shirts with the (albeit laudable) slogan, ""Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin"". This attracted some derision from ""anarcho-punk"" traditionalists [a251960], who replied with their own motif: ""Only Stupid Bastards Help EMI"".

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

They had already released their debut LP ""[m=13773]"" with Sub Pop, but their 1991 major-label debut for [l=DGC]/[l=Geffen Records], ""[m=13814]"" broke the band and grunge into the mainstream of America.

Following the release of their second full-length album [r=537394], disputes emerged within the band regarding copyright ownership of the name Nocturnus, as well as lyrical direction. Following these altercations, Mike Browning left the group as the remainder of the band began writing their third album with Browning's replacement James Marcinek. Unfortunately shortly after this, Nocturnus were dropped from their label, Earache, and managed to release a two-track, self-titled EP on Moribund Records before splitting up in 1993.

In 1999, the band briefly reunited to release [r=631033], however by 2002 they had officially disbanded.

The band formed in 2003 when guitarist Smith and singer Shoniwa of the band Sonarfly began playing and writing together more often. The two met drummer Morrison (formerly of Living With Eating Disorders, Willis, Six Toes, Jaywalk Buzz and others) in December 2003 and played a number of gigs across London over the winter.

They recorded their debut EP Three Moods of The Noisettes during this time, which was released in April 2005 on London indie label Side Salad Records. This led to signing internationally with Universal Music Group, who released the EP in the US on the Low Altitude imprint. Their next single, ""Iwe"" was released via the Transgressive label, followed by ""Scratch Your Name"" on Mercury/Side Salad Records; since then all releases have been on the Vertigo Records label.

Noisettes have toured Europe and the United States extensively, with the likes of TV on the Radio, Tom Vek, Babyshambles, Bloc Party and the Mystery Jets. They supported Muse on a UK and European arena tour in November and December 2006, and have a headline tour of the UK scheduled to promote the release of their debut album What's the Time Mr. Wolf? in February 2007.

Paul Stanley is an American hard rock guitarist, singer, musician, painter and songwriter best known for being the rhythm guitarist and primary lead vocalist of the rock band Kiss. He is the writer or co-writer of many of the band's highest-charting hits.

Before Kiss, Paul Stanley was in a local band, Rainbow (not to be confused with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow) and was also a member of Uncle Joe and Post War Baby Boom (with bassist [a1204385]). Through a mutual friend of Gene Simmons', Stanley joined Simmons' band [a=Wicked Lester (2)] in the early 1970s. The band recorded an album in 1972, but as of 2010 it has not been officially released (although songs from the album appeared on Kiss's 2001 box set). Wicked Lester soon fell apart and Stanley and Simmons placed ads for a drummer and a guitarist in various New York papers. This resulted in Peter Criss and Ace Frehley joining the group, and they named themselves Kiss. Kiss released their self-titled debut in February 1974.

Stanley's persona in Kiss was ""The Starchild"" utilizing one star over his right eye. For a brief time, Stanley changed his make-up character to ""The Bandit"", with a ""Lone Ranger"" style mask design make-up pattern. This make-up design would only be used during a few mid-1973 shows, soon to be replaced by the now famous ""The Starchild"" make-up design and persona. In his book Sex Money Kiss, Gene Simmons admits that Stanley was the driving force for Kiss during the makeup-free 1980s, while Simmons was feeling lost without his demon makeup and was distanced from the band while attempting to launch a film career.

In 1999, Stanley starred in a Toronto production of The Phantom of the Opera, in which he played the role of The Phantom. He appeared in the musical from May 25 to August 1, and again that year from September 30 to October 31, 1999.

Stanley made his debut as a painter in 2005, exhibiting and selling original works of art.

Stanley collaborated with Boston-based power pop group Click Five on their hit single, ""Angel To You (Devil To Me)""

Evolving from Cleveland's Teutonic protopunks, [a252899], Pere Ubu was formed late in 1975 by Thomas (aka Crocus Behemoth) and guitarist Peter Laughner (who died in 1977). Ubu's classic early singles, ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""Final Solution,"" oozed restless angst way before it became the domain of spoiled mallrats. By 1978's aggressive The Modern Dance and the wilder Dub Housing, Pere Ubu's subversions of rock were guided by superior musicianship and fallout from Thomas's Jehovah's Witness upbringing. Personality quirks split the band, and Thomas regrouped for three more self-indulgent albums through 1982, including the abstract stare-down of The Art Of Walking, all with some difficult sonic perversion to recommend them.

After several Ubus found themselves onstage in Thomas's Wooden Birds, the band was revived for 1988's The Tenement Year. With newfound focus, Pere Ubu unleashed the ravishing funhouse pop experiment of 1989's Cloudland, which treated mainstream textures like found sounds. The sparkling pop, dented by Thomas's unique warble, continued with the gently peculiar Worlds In Collision. But Ubu tired of the total pop concept and returned to quirkier pursuits for Story Of My Life. Tim Kerr Records picked up the ball with 1995's full-bodied Ray Gun Suitcase--a mix of Ubu's vicious rock, luscious pop and art-damaged identities--and a series of multimedia-enhanced EPs, for which Thomas programmed the codes."

It didn't take long before the trio released a self-titled demo, and participated on a split with Orchid.

In 1998, Pig Destroyer toured the East Coast with other bands, including Drop Dead, Converge, Kid Dynamite, and Isis. Later that year they parted ways with drummer John Evans, who was then replaced by Brian Harvey. They also started to play more shows and released an album, ""Explosions in Ward 6,"" which brought them out of the underground to be known as one of the better Grindcore bands. The band continued to tour with bands like Discordance Axis, Phobia, Daybreak, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Disassociate. They also played at the 2000 March Metal Meltdown. 

In July 2000, the band signed with Relapse, and recorded a split 7"" with Isis. It sold out in a month. They later recorded and released ""38 Counts Of Battery,"" which included the remastered ""Explosions In Ward 6"" album, tracks from the Isis and Orchid splits and their demo from 1997. 

In 2001, they released ""Prowler in the yard"" which is the most extreme album they've made to date. The album got them even more fame, and the band is now of the leading Grindcore bands.

Underwood had previously played with Ritchie Blackmore in the Outlaws, while Gustafson had been a member of The Merseybeats. Underwood later became drummer with Episode Six, and was joined by Gustafson after Roger Glover left to join Deep Purple. The band took its name from Professor Bernard Quatermass, a fictional scientist who had been the hero of three science fiction serials produced by BBC Television in the 1950s, and were signed to Harvest Records.
The group formed as a power trio with Hammond organ as the main instrument. Their first and only album sold itself through ""...compactness, wealth of ideas, forceful lead vocals and complicated arrangements, enriched by pianist Robinson's tasteful use of classical strings which are on display along with spacious keyboard passages at their height in the mold of The Nice."" One track, ""Laughin' Tackle"", includes 16 violins, 6 violas, 6 cellos, and 3 double bass, arranged by Robinson, and a drum solo by Underwood. Underwood remained in close contact with Blackmore, and visited Deep Purple in the studio while they were recording In Rock.
The group split in early 1971. Gustafson formed a new band, Bullet with ex-members of Atomic Rooster.
The band's song ""Black Sheep of the Family"" was the first track to be recorded by Rainbow, having been rejected for the Deep Purple album Stormbringer."

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.

The name Radiohead comes from the [a=Talking Heads] song, ""Radio Head"", from the ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/master/39386]True Stories[/url]"" album.

Formed by school friends in 1985, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's ""[r=767600]"". The cathartic ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Creep/master/21481]Creep[/url]"", from the debut album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Pablo-Honey/master/13344]Pablo Honey[/url]"" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves.

Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]"" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]'s expressive singing. The album featured the hits ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High & Dry[/url]"", ""[r=1463625]"" and ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]"".

The band's third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]"" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990s, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]"" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.

""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]"" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]"" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]"", was released in May 2016.
 
Radiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Smiths,+The]The Smiths[/url], [a=Pixies], [a=Magazine], [a=Joy Division] and [a=Siouxsie & The Banshees], who Thom Yorke claims inspired him to become a performer, and [a=R.E.M.] (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, referring to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').

By 1973, Blackmore had steered [a170355] through a significant personnel change, with [a349634] and [a123906] being replaced by [a369909] and [a267270]. However, the new members were keen to add new musical styles and Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned ""Black Sheep of the Family"" with ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves"" turned down by the band. He decided to record the song with [a291557] instead, using Dio's band [a312415] as additional musicians. He enjoyed the results, and a full album, billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood.

After the release of three studio albums and an extensive world tour in 1977–78, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the ""sword and sorcery"" theme. Dio did not agree with this change and left Rainbow. Together with then new vocalist [a353675], Blackmore scored a hit single with “Since You Been Gone”. 

After more lineup changes and albums, Ritchie disbanded Rainbow in early 1984 to rejoin the reunited Deep Purple.

He resurrected Rainbow once again in early 1994, just after leaving Deep Purple for good. However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [a485494] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [a298038]. 

Against all expectations, Blackmore reformed Rainbow, with an all-new line-up, in late 2015. Blackmore announced that he would play ""all rock"" concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner of 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow', his first rock shows since 1997. The new Rainbow line-up was announced on November 6, 2015. It featured [a4778506] singer [a4290197], [a324356] keyboardist [a309710], Blackmore’s Night drummer David Keith and bassist Bob Nouveau (Bob Curiano)."

After Tommy left the band in early 1978 he was replaced by [a=Marky Ramone] (Marc Bell). He was fired in 1983 and was then replaced by [a=Richie Ramone] (Richard Beau). In 1987, he then left the band and was briefly replaced by Elvis Ramone ([a=Clem Burke]) for two performances (August 28 & 29, 1987) before Marky returned in September, 1987. In 1989, Dee Dee left and was replaced by [a=C.J. Ramone] (Christopher John Ward).

In 2001, Joey Ramone passed away, a victim of Lymphoma. The following year, Dee Dee died in Los Angeles on June 5th, 2002. Johnny Ramone died in his sleep in Los Angeles on September 15th, 2004.

The band were frequently confronted by protestors while on tour.  Their first EP, 1988's ""Budd"" was named after Budd R.

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

Relf assumed the role of guitarist, and they were joined by bassist [a=Louis Cennamo], keyboardist [a=John Hawken], and vocalist [a=Jane Relf].  This lineup recorded the first self-titled album and most of the second album, Illusion (1971).  A rapid series of personnel changes followed.  Guitarist and composer [a=Michael Dunford] first appeared on Illusion.  Before his departure from the band Hawken recruited new vocalist [a=Annie Haslam].  By 1972, when the Renaissance recorded their third album, [m=25026], none of the original members remained though McCarty still wrote music for the band.

By 1973 the lineup had stabilized with Haslam, Dunford, keyboardist [a=John Tout], bassist and vocalist [a=Jon Camp], and drummer [a=Terry Sullivan].  This lineup produced a string of relatively successful albums over the remainder of the decade.  They had one Top 10 single in the U.K., ""[m=25018]"", from the album [m=24998] (1978).

By 1980 Sullivan and Tout departed leaving Haslam, Dunford, and Camp as the stable core of the group with various other musicians coming and going through the early and mid 1980s.  The group released two albums, [m=66421] (1981) and [m=66404] (1983) which were not well received by either fans or critics.  Renaissance went into the studio to record a further album but found themselves without a label willing to release it.  Material for this album as well as discarded tracks from the sessions for the previous three releases finally saw the light of day as [m=25034] in 1997.  

Renaissance broke up in 1987 but both Michael Dunford and Annie Haslam tried to revive the name with different musicians in the 1990s.  Haslam, Dunford, Tout, and Sullivan did reunite and released a studio album, [m=422543], in 2001, and a live album, [m=596367], in 2002.  In 2009 Haslam and Dunford reformed Renaissance for a 40th anniversary concert tour.  [a=Rave Tesar], who replaced John Tout on keyboards for the 2001-02 tour and [a=David J. Keyes], the bassist from the same tour, also rejoined the band.  Two new members were also added to the lineup, keyboardist [a=Tom Brislin] and drummer [a=Frank Pagano].

Live CDs and DVDs from their 2011 tour were released, with [a=Jason Hart] replacing Tom Brislin on keyboards.  In 2013 their first new studio album in 12 years, [m=569466] was released.  It was the last album to feature Michael Dunford, who died in November, 2012."

The band changed their name to Repulsion (to avoid being mistaken for numerous other bands called Genocide). In 1986, [a254269] of Florida's [a254268] asked Scott and Matt to move to Florida to become members of Death and Repulsion was put on hold. In late 1986, Scott and Matt returned to Michigan and Repulsion reformed, recording the 'Slaughter Of The Innocent' LP with [a276346]. The LP was originally intended to be released on Earp's own label, Wyatt Earp Records, but this never occurred. They played their final show in January 1988.

The group formed from the ashes of Insurrection, a hardcore band featuring Brendan Canty (drums), Michael Fellows (bass), and Guy Picciotto (guitar).  Following Insurrection's demise, Guy, Brendan, and Michael kept jamming together and guitarist Eddie Janney soon joined the mix, while Guy added vocals to his responsibilities.  Although the band's live appearances were rare (only around a dozen in 2 years), the band was known for their passionate live shows (which could allegedly move some audience members to tears).  Guy's poetic lyrics and impassioned delivery led the group to be tagged as ""emotional hardcore"" (later shortened to ""emo"") by some critics and naysayers.  

During their life span, the group released one LP and one 7"" EP.  They split upon the release of the EP, in January of 1987, when Michael Fellows left the band.  The rest of the band went on to form [a=One Last Wish] with guitarist Michael Hampton (Janney moved to bass) who split after playing only a half a dozen shows and recording an LP (which went unreleased for many years).  The members of Rites Of Spring reformed as [a=Happy Go Licky] in 1987, pursuing a sound very different from Rites Of Spring.

Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently between that time and their break-up in 2011. Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.

Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 (Performers) and Roxy Music frontman [a87721] was awarded a CBE by Her Majesty the Queen of England on 30 November 2011.

Roxy Music have released 28 albums and 38 compilations since the band’s inception back in 1971. Of these, 18 have made the ‘UK Top 40’ music charts with 11 of them reaching the ‘Top 10’ and 4 albums reaching the No.1 position.

Similarly, Roxy Music have had success with some of their 49 single/EP releases. In this case, there has been a chart entry for 18 of these releases, with one single making the No.1 spot. In February 1981, Roxy Music hit the singles chart 'top spot' with the John Lennon composed song ‘[m=58331]’ and spent 2 weeks at that coveted position, 9 weeks in the chart’s Top 40 (6 weeks in the Top 10) and 11 weeks overall.

The 18 Roxy Music hit singles/EPs have spent time in the UK Top 40 music charts for 128 weeks, with 44 of these within the Top 10. The single with the most time in the UK Charts is ‘[m=58323]’, which entered the charts in April 1979 and overall spent 14 weeks charting.

Rusted Shut was formed in 1988 by the couple of Don Walsh (vocals, guitar) & Sibyl Chance (drums), the same year the duo's previous band [a311137] disbanded. Gene Lee was soon added on bass, and the band did its first shows under the names “The Exploding Funeral Flowers” and “Bloody Mailboxes”, before settling to the name Rusted Shut. They performed very chaotic shows at local club Axiom, sometimes playing 4-hour sets.

In 1989, ex-Grindin Teeth member Bob Wilson entered the band. The group played a show opening for [a306171]. By 1990, both Lee and Wilson were out of the band, with Chance moving to bass, and the duo using a drum machine in order to write songs. In 1991, Matt Sargent (another ex-Grindin Teeth member) became the band’s drummer. The band played a few shows and contributed a track on the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/9377931-Various-Great-Big-Pile] Great Big Pile [/url] comp, before taking a break in 1993 so Walsh and Chance focus on their new project “No Rock Gods”. The trio resumed playing in 1994, and in 1996 their first release (a self-titled CD), appeared on [l47646].

After the CD’s release, Sargent left to play guitar in his Surf-Rock band. In 1997, he was replaced by [a2198499], with Kyle Phillips also joining the same year on second guitar. The band soon entered the studio (minus Phillips, who had gone to rehab) to record a few tracks that would later appear on the 2008 12”, “Hot Sex”. Later that year, the trio did another session, which would be released as their second album “Rehab” in 2003. After the album’s release, Chance separated from Walsh and left the band.

Shaun Kelly replaced Chance on bass in 2004, but left the band in 2007, and was in turn replaced by [a=Richie G.]. The new trio entered the studio in 2008 to record an improvised album for [l17358], entitled “Dead”. In 2011, Adam Ferguson was added on second guitar, but moved to bass in 2014, after Richie passed away the same year. In 2015 keyboardist Mel entered the band.

The band was formed in 1979 under the name Tyrant, with Dave Chandler (guitar, vocals), Mark Adams (bass), and Armando Acosta (drums), but soon added Scott Reagers on vocals and changed their name to Saint Vitus after the song ""St. Vitus' Dance"" by Black Sabbath. Their main influences were Sabbath and Black Flag, the latter of which Saint Vitus toured with during the 1980's.

Under this line-up, Saint Vitus recorded 2 albums, ""Saint Vitus"" & ""Hallow's Victim"", and an EP ""The Walking Dead"". After ""The Walking Dead"" Reagers left the band and was replaced by The Obsessed frontman Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich (at this time, The Obsessed had only released one 7"").

Wino recorded three studio albums (""Born Too Late"", ""Mournful Cries"" & ""V""), a live album (""Live""), and an EP (""Thirsty and Miserable"", featuring the Black Flag cover of the same name) with Vitus. Weinrich left Saint Vitus in 1991 to reform The Obsessed after Vitus's label, Hellhound Records, released an album of older Obsessed recordings.

Following Weinrich's departure, Saint Vitus went on hiatus. The band finally found former Count Raven singer Christian Lindersson as Weinrich's replacement. He would record only one album, ""C.O.D."" before being replaced by original Vitus vocalist, Scott Reagers. 

Reagers recorded vocals for the band's final album, ""Die Healing"". After this, Saint Vitus decided to call it a day in 1996.

""Born Too Late"" line-up (Weinrich, Chandler, Adams, Acosta) played a gig at Double Door in Chicago.The performance was recorded and released on a DVD that is distributed through Chandler's current band, Debris, Inc., which features former Trouble bassist Ron Holzner. Following the reunion, Saint Vitus parted ways again.

As of 2008, Saint Vitus have reformed again. The band headlined the April 24 date at the 2009 Roadburn Festival.  The lineup for this reunion was the same as the 2003 reunion. Sometime after this gig, drummer Armando Acosta was removed from the band and was replaced by Henry Vasquez, with health concerns being cited as the primary case for his removal (Acosta eventually passed away in November 2010).

The band was born in Philadelphia in 2000 and moved to Los Angeles in 2001 after Keith Gibbs (guitar, vox) joined up with Detroit natives Rick Ferrante (drums) and Clayton Charles (bass).

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

After the release of 1992's ""Get Your Goat"", Russell and Matthews left the group and were replaced by Adam Wade (ex-[a=Jawbox]) and Nathan Larson (ex-[a=Swiz]), respectively.  This line-up released a single on Dischord before making the jump to a major label, one of only 2 Dischord acts to ever do so.  Their major label debut, ""Pony Express Record"" received critical acclaim and scored a minor hit with the song ""X-French Tee Shirt"" but the band failed to find big-time success with a mainstream audience and received backlash from hardcore independent rock fans for leaving Dischord.  Things were further complicated as Werden spent the next few years battling Hodgkin's Disease.  Shudder To Think returned in 1997 with ""50,000 BC"" (and with Kevin March replacing Adam Wade) and moved into soundtrack work but split by the end of the decade.

Wedren, Larson, and March reunited in 2007 with a new bassist and a third guitarist for a show in New York.  The group reunited again for a tour in the Fall of 2008 and released a live album in 2009."

SKINLESS exploded onto the metal scene in 1992. Despite a variety of lineup changes, the songwriting team of Noah Carpenter (guitars) and Sherwood Webber (vocals) has remained constant since 1994. After adding the talents of Bob Beaulac (drums) and Joe Keyser (bass) SKINLESS established a solid, dedicated line-up, recorded two demos and appeared on numerous compilations.

In 1998, SKINLESS released their full-length debut 'Progression Towards Evil.' Recorded at Max Trax Studios in Albany, NY 'Progression...' stunned the underground, showcasing the musicianship and energy that the band had become known for via its intense live performances. An entirely independent release, 'Progression...' received frenzied acclaim from press the world over and saw remarkable sales. SKINLESS embarked on three immensely successful tours in support of 'Progression...' introducing legions of fans to the punishing live SKINLESS experience. The band toured the US with underground legends MORTICIAN on 1999's Chainsaw Tour, and in the Spring of 2000, SKINLESS toured the U.S. and Mexico with INCANTATION, spawning even more followers of the brutal underground revolution. Their subsequent European headlining tour claimed further disciples.

On their Relapse debut 'Foreshadowing Our Demise,' SKINLESS painted violent pictures of utter devastation. 'Foreshadowing Our Demise' sonically documented the endless energy of the band's burly live performances, delivering an annihilating combination of punishing grooves and ultimate brutality. SKINLESS' gut-twisting deathgrind deluged listeners with colossal riffs, chaotic percussion and Webber's scathing vocal attack. SKINLESS toured as much as possible in 2001/2002, being personally invited to hit the road with the likes of HATEBREED and SIX FEET UNDER, thus furthering their growing following.

Founded and led by singer Ian Stuart Donaldson in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, in 1976, relocating to Manchester in 1978. The band originally sported a punk look, but, at their label's urging, became skinheads during the second wave of skinheads in England. Skrewdriver became known for attracting violence at their shows and none of their Chiswick releases did very well in the UK charts. They broke up in 1979.

Donaldson re-formed the band in 1982 as an explicityly White Power National Socialist band, with an entirely new, and often-changing lineup. This new version of Skrewdriver became the musical arm of the British National Front and released as their debut album ""Hail The New Dawn"" in 1984 on the German Rock-O-Rama label. This release not only helped transform the label to a far-right position but effectively invented White Power rock and Skrewdriver quickly became a driving force behind the R.A.C (Rock Against Communism) movement.

In 1993 Ian Stuart died in a car accident, bringing an end to the band.

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

Australian poet, guitarist, singer, composer and performance artist [a=Daevid Allen] moved to Paris in 1960. Inspired by the emerging 'Beat Generation' of writer's works he'd discovered whilst working in a Melbourne bookshop he moved into a room in Paris's 'Beat Hotel' and spent time around the city's Latin Quarter. There, he rubbed shoulders with [a=Terry Riley] and [a=William S. Burroughs], gaining free access to the area's jazz clubs. Influenced by the music philosophies of [a=Sun Ra] he formed the [a=Daevid Allen Trio], a free-jazz outfit which performed in Burroughs' theatre pieces based on that writer's novel 'The Ticket That Exploded'. 

In 1961 Allen travelled to Canterbury, England, where he met 16 year-old [a=Robert Wyatt] (who was the son of his landlord). Their mutual interest in jazz resulted in a few gigs, in London in 1963, as the Daevid Allen Trio (with [a=Hugh Hopper] on bass and [a=Mike Ratledge] occasionally guesting on piano). Around the same time, Wyatt formed the [b][a=Wilde Flowers][/b] with the Hopper brothers, Hugh and Brian Hopper, with [a=Kevin Ayers] on vocals.

The impetus behind the formation of [a=Soft Machine] occurred in a meeting of Daevid Allen and Kevin Ayers with Texan millionaire Wes Brunson in Deya, Majorca, on Easter Sunday 1966. Brunson agreed to put up the money for a new band, which allowed the group to buy equipment and rent a rehearsal room near Canterbury. The original line-up consisted of Robert Wyatt on drums and vocals, Mike Ratledge on keyboards, Daevid Allen on guitar and Kevin Ayers on bass and vocals. From May 1966 they gigged as Mister Head (aka Mr Head) and became [b]Soft Machine[/b] in August 1966.

The name was taken from a William S. Burroughs novel 'The Soft Machine' (part of The Nova Trilogy), with agreement from the author. The title The Soft Machine encapsulates the Human Body, and the main theme of the book - as explicitly written in an appendix - concerns how control mechanisms invade the body. One poem, entitled Mens (Man, as in 'human'), by Dutch-American hematologist and poet Leo Vroman starts with the line: ""Man is a soft machine...""

Mike Ratledge says of this : ""... Soft machine was a generic term for the whole of humanity, and we were all soft machines... I guess our basic assumption was that what we liked, everybody else was going to like as well, that we all had things in common, and therefore we all are soft machines, and we were all going to like Soft Machine music. It might have been a false assumption, but I hope it's true"".

In January 1967, the band's first single release, [i][b][m16803][/b][/i], was recorded.. Celebrating its release on February 22nd 1967 the band gave a press conference at The Speakeasy, performing that evening at The Roundhouse as the opening act for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience] - where Hendrix jammed with them on bass. 

Allen recalls their introduction to The Speakeasy by [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], the promoter, producer, founder of the Crawdaddy Club and original manager of both [a=The Yardbirds] and [a=the Rolling Stones]; “He would take us there and ply us with whiskeys on the expense account. We’d meet all the big stars at the time. It was like being at court, only a rock ‘n’ roll court. ‘Cause [a=the Beatles] were there, the Rolling Stones were there – everybody, all the big names, would gather at the Speakeasy at this particular time.” [From the book 'Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous' by Graham Bennett].

Three months later, a collection of demos was recorded at DeLane Lea Studios with producer [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], but not officially released until 1971 as two compilations on the French [l=BYG Records] label. At that time, Soft Machine had already become something of a 'cult' band on the London psychedelic scene, gigging at places like the Zebra Club, The Marquee, The Roundhouse, UFO (Underground Freak Out club) and Middle Earth. Light shows were also developed with Mark Boyle's Sensual Laboratory. On April 29th, 1967, they took part in the '14 Hour Technicolor Dream', an event set up by the underground paper 'International Times', which also featured [a=Pink Floyd], [a=the Move], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Crazy World of Arthur Brown], [a=Tomorrow (2)], [a=Mothers of Invention], [a=Velvet Underground] and artists such as [a=Alan Ginsberg] and [a=Yoko Ono].

During the summer of 1967 the band toured France, performing at psychedelic events along the Cote d’Azur such as [a=Jean-Jacques Lebel]’s “Sunlove Happening” and [l=Eddie Barclay]’s “La Nuit Pschedelique”. For three weeks they provided daily musical “transmissions hallucinatoires” for wildly popular performances of “Le Désir Attrapé par la Queue”, a Pablo Picasso play produced by Lebel at the Festival de la Libre Expression outside Saint-Tropez. A legendary performance of “Do It Again” helped Soft Machine to make an enormous impression in France and, by the end of the Summer of Love, they became the favorite band of the French avant-garde. 

On the way back Daevid Allen was refused re-entry to England and stayed in France, moving on to various projects before forming [a=Gong] two years later, while Robert Wyatt, Mike Ratledge and Kevin Ayers decided to carry on Soft Machine as a trio.

In February 1968, Soft Machine embarked on a three month US tour (opening for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience]), recording their first album during their touring schedule in New York in four days in April 1968, with production handled by Tom Wilson and former [a=Animals] bassist and Hendrix producer [a=Chas Chandler]. Although quickly made and not particularly well-recorded, the band's eponymous album [i][b][m=16766][/b][/i] (1968) is now considered a classic of the extraordinarily creative post-psychedelic and pre-progressive period of the late 1960's.

The band split up in December 1968, re-formed in February 1969 and carried on until the late 1970's through many line-up changes and leaving no original member onboard. It re-formed briefly in 1980 and 1984. Robert Wyatt formed [b][a=Matching Mole][/b] in October 1971. ""Matching Mole"" is a clever mis-pronounciation of ""La Machine Molle"", the French title of William Burroughs' novel ""The Soft Machine"".

The group's first demo tape, released under the name Squirrelbait Youth, featured drummer Rich Schuler and saw Grubbs handle both guitar and vocals. This lineup self-released a second tape in 1983.

After Rich Schuler moved away, Britt Walford took over on drums and Peter Searcy joined as singer. In July 1984, this lineup recorded ten songs at Sound on Sound with engineer Howie Gano for possible release on [l183915]. Two songs from this studio session would appear on Squirrel Bait's self-titled EP for Homestead the following year, while ""Tense/Earth Shattering"" would eventually be released in 1987 under the alias [a15556173]. These recordings feature a more driving, melodic sound than the hardcore thrash of their early tapes.

In May 1985, the band, now featuring Ben Daughtrey on drums and Brian McMahan on second guitar, returned to Sound on Sound to record six more songs. The band's debut self-titled EP, released in the fall of 1985, received much critical acclaim. The same lineup recorded the band's only LP, 1987's Skag Heaven. The group broke up after its release, owing to personal and musical differences within the band and Grubbs and Johnson's decision to leave Louisville for college. Grubbs and Johnson would reunite in [a=Bastro], and McMahan and Walford, who while never in Squirrel Bait at the same time had played together in various bands since middle school, went on to form [a=Slint].  In the mid 1990s, Grubbs reissued the self-titled EP and Skag Heaven on his short-lived [l=Dexter's Cigar] imprint for Drag City."

This serious image gained them the rather derogatory and unrepresentative ‘stool rock’ tag. 
Songwriter Gavin Clarke originally met film director [a=Shane Meadows] when both were working in dead-end jobs at the Alton Towers leisure park. Several years later, Meadows contacted Clarke to provide songs for the soundtrack to his acclaimed low-budget film, Small Time. Clarke quickly formed a band for the work, recruiting guitarist Paul Bacon and two former members of indie band [a=The Telescopes], bass player Robert Brooks (b. 11 April 1969, Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England) and drummer Dominic Dillon (b. 26 September 1964, Bolton, Lancashire, England). The band signed a contract with Independiente Records and completed further soundtrack work for Meadows’ feature-length debut, Twenty-Four Seven. The limited edition Small Time EP and single ‘Monkey Dread’ introduced the band’s full-length debut, Crazy On The Weekend, released in 1998. 
Working with producer John Reynolds (Sinéad O’Connor), the band continued their practice of recording outside a studio environment. Their acoustic-based songs were augmented by washes of strings and organ, earning comparisons to Nick Drake, Tom Waits and Beth Orton. Clarke’s cinéma vérité style lyrics, meanwhile, soared above their soundtrack origins. Sadly, this proved to be the only Sunhouse release. Clarke later recorded with Clayhill."

Born: 6 January 1946 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England, UK. 
Died: 7 July 2006 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England, UK (aged 60). 

A key figure in the development of London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and—despite his rather brief period of activity—a continuing influence on popular (and unpopular) music onward into the 21st century. Unfortunately, soon after achieving success with [a=Pink Floyd], he began to suffer from mental problems, possibly complicated by drug use, from which he never fully recovered. 

Having become increasingly unpredictable in person and unreliable as a performer, he was pushed out of the band in 1968. He continued with a brief solo career, releasing eclectic albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, before leaving the music industry and spending the rest of his life living in relative seclusion. 

In 1972 he was in the brief super-group ""Stars"" that played a small number of live concerts in Cambridge in February 1972. Its members were Syd Barrett on guitar, Twink on drums, and Jack Monck on bass . 

Barrett had an infamous ""reunion"" with Pink Floyd in 1975, when he showed up at the mixing session for Shine On You Crazy Diamond, ironically a song written in tribute to him. His appearance—overweight and shaven-haired—shocked and saddened his former bandmates.

Barrett died in 2006, following complications with diabetes.

After releasing a handful of demo tapes in 1987 and 1988 and splitting up in 1988, they recorded the full-length album ""World Downfall"" posthumously in the now legendary Morrisound Recordings studio (Tampa, Florida) with engineer-guru Scott Burns. At the time of this recording Terrorizer's original bass player Garvey was in jail so David Vincent (MORBID ANGEL) filled in. 

Another interesting fact is that ""World Downfall"" consists of about 30% Nausea songs, including the title track.

Terrorizer's lyrics were typical socio-political grindcore lyrics with animal rights / environmental topics handled as well. 

The band members later joined other bands like NAPALM DEATH (Jesse), MORBID ANGEL (Pete) and NAUSEA (Garvey).

In 2006 Terrorizer released their long-awaited second album ""Darker Days Ahead"" which consists of half old demo songs and half new material. Shortly after the release of the album, Jesse Pintado passed away on 27 August 2006.

The band has been reactivated in 2008 demo-ing new songs. Guitar duties are now taken over by Katina, guitarist in Resistant Culture. 

According to the press release their third album ""Hordes of Zombies"" was recorded in 2011, slated for release on Season of Mist on 24 February 2012. However the album has reportedly already been recorded in 2009 before Pete Sandoval underwent back surgery.

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

In addition, they released the Spit Blood EP in 2002 via the Meteor City Label.
Ed was replaced in 2005 by guitarist/vocalist Finn Ryan (formerly of Core). The band focused on writing and touring for a year before entering Trax East Studios in South River, New Jersey to record their follow up, aptly titled 3. The 2005 release included two European and North American tours, along with a visit to Seattle's ""Sound House"" to record the 2006 EP, Boxriff. Engineered by Jack Endino, the EP included a DVD of live show filmed in Seattle's Sunset Tavern.
Current Monster Magnet drummer Bob Pantella joins the band in 2007 and Atomic Bitchwax commenced more touring. The year concluded with the recording and release of the full-length album 4 on Teepee and Meteor City. In 2011, the band released The Local Fuzz, one 42 minute track with over 50 riffs back-to-back. The band spent 2012-2015 touring Australia, New Zealand, England, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Austria and North America.
Chris also joins Monster Magnet in 2013.

The Magnetic Fields is essentially a vehicle for Merritt's songwriting, along with various side-projects, such as The 6ths, Future Bible Heroes and The Gothic Archies. While the particular musical style of the band is usually as malleable as Merritt's songwriting, its songs are commonly attributed to pop genres and subgenres: synthpop, indie pop, and noise pop. The band is often also cited as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous."

They changed their name to The Matches in 2002 and released 3 studio albums before going on hiatus in 2009. They have reunited every few years since, celebrating the 10-year anniversaries of each of their albums with performances and deluxe vinyl reissues.

The Locals were formed by high school students [a=Matt Esposito] (lead guitar, backing vocals), Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals), Matt Whalen (drums, percussion), and Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar). [a=Miles Hurwitz] became their manager in 2000 and played a major role in guiding their career, including acting as co-writer and producer. Esposito left after graduating and was replaced by Jon Devoto. As The Locals, the band released a 6-song demo and 3-song EP, and built up a following in the East Bay. In 2002, threatened with a copyright infringement lawsuit by [a=Yvonne Doll And The Locals], they changed their name to The Matches.

The Matches recorded and self-released their first album, [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] (2003). They signed to Epitaph Records, who re-mixed and re-released it the following year. Their second album, [i]Decomposer[/i] (2006) took their music in a more idiosyncratic direction with contributions from nine different record producers. It reached no. 18 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. Extensive worldwide touring followed over the next two years. Their third album, [i]A Band In Hope[/i], was released in March 2008 and found them shifting further away from pop-punk. It reached no. 179 on the [i]Billboard[/i] 200. San Souci left the band that July and was replaced by Dylan Rowe.

The Matches announced a hiatus in July 2009. Shortly thereafter, they self-released the digital album [i]The Matches Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title? Or Not Needed?[/i], a collection of demos and unreleased tracks. Devoto started [a=Bird By Bird], while Harris started [a=Maniac (19)], then [a=Fortress Social Club].

In 2014 the lineup of Harris, San Souci, Whalen, and Devoto reconvened to re-release [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] as a deluxe 2-LP set. A string of reunion shows resulted in the digital live album [i]10YearsEVDKTL[/i]. A new single, ""Life Of A Match / Crucial Comeback"", followed in 2015. The following year they re-released [i]Decomposer[/i], also as a deluxe 2-LP set, and again played a series of shows resulting in a digital live album, [i]Recomposer[/i]. They repeated this pattern again in 2018, reissuing [i]A Band In Hope[/i] as a deluxe 2-LP set followed by a series of shows and the digital live album [i]Aband1nh0pe[/i]."

After nine months in New York, Richman decided he'd had enough.

Second guitarist Tim Green joined near the end of 1989 and the group altered their name to ""The Nation of Ulysses"".

N.O.U. presented themselves as a radical political party instead of a rock band.  They renamed the home they shared ""The Embassey"" and published a 'zine called ""Ulysses Speaks"" to expand upon their philosophies and ideals, which included the destruction of America and ""Parent Culture"", aligning themselves with radical political movements, fake time-lines of supposed N.O.U. terrorist activities, calling for the consumption of large amounts of sugar and caffeine, succession from the United States, and the idea that no one involved with the N.O.U. would ever age past 18.  The liner notes of the band's releases also reflected these sentiments.  Just how serious all this was has long been a matter of debate, although political rhetoric has continued to be a part of Ian Svenonius's post-N.O.U. work.

Their first single 'In A Rut' only just missed out on getting into the Top 40, though it did earn them three sessions with BBC Radio One and a contract with Virgin. The next single 'Babylon's Burning' was a hit going in to the top ten, this was followed by a couple more successful singles. They began to attract attention from hard-line Skinheads who disagreed with the bands anti-racist stance. This resulted in violence at some of their gigs which caused Owen, who was already having problems with heroin to become depressed. The first release of the 80's for the band 'Staring At The Rude Boys', was sadly also to be Owens last, as he passed away, July, 14th, 1980, after taking a heroin overdose.

It defied the expectations of their parents, who said ""imagine the girls to be inevitably bound for stardom"", and they disappeared without a trace.
In 1975, the sisters again entered the studio although the death of their father/manager, Austin Wiggin, resulted in their not being published for years as well as the group's dissolution. Years after their break-up their debut was rediscovered and championed as an example of art brut/outsider music."

Kate Korus was sacked and went on to form the Mo-dettes and Gutsy quit to team up with the Flicks. They were replaced by guitarist [a=Viv Albertine] and bass player [a=Tessa Pollitt] and it was this line-up that supported the Clash during the spring of 1977. 

The band were known for their uncompromising attitude and professed lack of technique, but their music was as aggressive and confrontational as the best of the punk fraternity. Their sound at this time is captured on the first two John Peel sessions, which many people consider their best work. Their failure to secure a record contract during the first wave of the punk explosion was surprising. By the time they made their recording debut, Palmolive had been ousted and replaced by Big In Japan percussionist [a295874] (b. Peter Clark, 21 August 1957). 

Signed to Island Records, they worked with reggae producer [a=Dennis Bovell] on the dub-influenced Cut. The album attracted considerable press interest for its sleeve, which featured the band naked, after rolling in mud.

The departure of Budgie to Siouxsie And The Banshees (replaced by the Pop Group's Bruce Smith) coincided with the arrival of reggae musician Prince Hammer and trumpeter Don Cherry, whose very young stepdaughter, Neneh Cherry also joined for a short period. A series of singles followed, including a memorable version of John Holt's ""Man Next Door"". 

By 1981, The Slits had lost much of their original cutting edge and it came as little surprise when they disbanded at the end of the year. Ari-Up revived The Slits in the new millennium for a series of low-key live sets.

The group has no permanent group line-up, and Johnson has collaborated with a wide range of musicians, changing personnel from project to project.
The The began recording in 1979/1980 and released their first single “Controversial Subject” in 1980. The first album release came in 1983, the critically acclaimed “Soul Mining"", which featured guest appearances from [a=Orange Juice (3)] drummer [a=Zeke Manyika], [a=Jools Holland], [a=Thomas Leer] and [a15025].
Johnson followed with a new album entitled “Infected” in 1986, recording again with Zeke Manyika, plus singer [a=Neneh Cherry], and a number of session musicians. Four singles were released from the album, with ""Heartland"" being the most successful, reaching 29 in the UK Chart. The album was accompanied by a full length video “Infected: The Movie” which was shot on location in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Johnson toured the world extensively with the movie. 
In 1988, Johnson re-formed The The as a four piece band, having recruited ex-[a=The Smiths] guitarist [a=Johnny Marr], bassist [a=James Eller] and former [a=ABC] drummer [a=David Palmer] as full time band members. This line-up recorded the album “Mind Bomb”, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and featured the band's highest charting single to that time, ""The Beat(en) Generation"" hitting 18 in the UK chart.
In 1989 keyboard player [a=D.C. Collard] was added to the line-up and the band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called “The The Versus The World”, culminating in three sold out gigs at London's Royal Albert Hall at the end of the tour. 
In 1990 the studio EP “Shades of Blue” was released. 
In 1993, the five-piece line-up (Johnson/Marr/Collard/Eller/Palmer) recorded The The’s fourth album “Dusk”, which debuted at No. 2 in the UK. Another world tour followed, the “Lonely Planet” tour. Johnson relocated the band to America, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by guitarist [a=Keith Joyner] and bassist [a=Jared Michael Nickerson]. Harmonica player [a=Jim Fitting] (formerly of [a=Treat Her Right]) joined the band in early 1993. Palmer left the band partway through the tour and was replaced by ex-[a=Stabbing Westward] drummer [a=Andy Kubiszewski]. The reshuffled band headlined the main stage at the 1993 Reading Festival.
Johnson then permanently relocated to New York, and The The's next project was 1995's “Hanky Panky”, an album that consisted entirely of [a=Hank Williams] cover versions. “Hanky Panky” was recorded by a new The The group, this time consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, guitarist [a=Eric Schermerhorn], bass guitarist [a=Gail Ann Dorsey], and drummer [a=Brian MacLeod]. Their cover version of ""I Saw The Light"" hit No. 31 in the UK chart.
In 2000, The The, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, bassist [a=Spencer Campbell] and drummer [a=Earl Harvin], released its sixth album “NakedSelf” and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour, “The Naked Tour”, lasting 14 months. “NakedSelf” remains The The's final released studio album to date.
Since 2003 the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations.

They recorded six studio albums, two additional soundtrack albums, and many singles in the first stage of their career. 

After a hiatus between 2004 and 2008, the band's line-up was reduced down to Staples, Boulter and Fraser, with a rhythm section of  [a=Earl Harvin] (drums) and [a=Dan McKinna] (bass) (and intermittent appearances by [a215721] and [a83515]). Their second act now eclipses their first line-up in terms of volume of output (if not commercial success).

Tindersticks were one of the most original and distinctive British acts of the '90s, standing apart from both the British indie scene and the rash of Brit-pop guitar combos that dominated the U.K. charts. Where their contemporaries were often direct and to the point, Tindersticks were obtuse and leisurely, crafting dense, difficult songs layered with literary lyrics, intertwining melodies, mumbling vocals, and gently melancholy orchestrations.

At the start of their career, the group filtered the dark romanticism of Leonard Cohen, Ian Curtis, and Scott Walker through the bizarre pop songcraft of Lee Hazlewood and the aesthetics of indie rock. Later recordings have been marked by the influence of soul music, and their excursions into instrumental soundtrack work (primarily working for director Claire Denis). Though their music was far from casual listening, Tindersticks gained a dedicated cult following in the mid-'90s, beginning with their eponymous 1993 debut album, and continue to release music to a dedicated fanbase."

The band changed its name to [a=Killer (33)] in 1980, then to [a=Genghis Khan (2)] in 1981 and finally to Tokyo Blade in 1983. The band was part of the NWOBHM movement.

TOKYO BLADE proved extremely popular in Europe touring on a regular basis, but failed to ignite sufficient interest in Britain despite steady commendable reviews. Ultimately the band's impetus, provided initially by a crop of strong NWoBHM era singles and albums, was sapped by a series of unstable line ups.
Formerly known as KILLERS , featuring a line up of vocalist Alan Marsh, guitarists Andy Boulton, and Ray Disemore, bassist Andy Robbins and drummer Steve Pierce, the Salisbury group released the demo 'For Serious Applicants Only' in 1981 before adopting the new title of GENGHIS KHAN. As GENGHIS KHAN, the quintet released three singles prior to a further name change to TOKYO BLADE, re-issuing the 'If Heaven Is Hell' single under the new title and, naturally, in new packaging. TOKYO BLADE attracted the attention of the York based Powerstation label and the independent label released the five piece band's self-titled debut album in 1983.

In May 2022, Steve Brooks announced that he would leave Torche after a final tour in late 2022. It was confirmed on September 17, 2022, that the band would not continue without Brooks. The group played their final concert on October 16, 2022 at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, GA.

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond.

Raised in Milford, Pennsylvania, her mother was a piano teacher, and exposed Vanessa to classical music from a young age. By age two, she began playing the piano, and at age 9 became obsessed with ballet. She joined the School of American Ballet at age 14, living in a dorm at Lincoln Center and enrolling in the Professional Children's School. During her time at the academy, she continued playing the piano and writing songs, nurturing her blossoming songwriting skills. Upon graduation, she moved to Hell's Kitchen, where she waitressed five nights a week and performed at local clubs on open mic nights, honing her craft and developing a stage presence. At home, she would often stay up until 4 a.m. recording demos on a four-track machine, and was signed to A&M Records in 2001. Her first video, for the song ""A Thousand Miles,"" was released even as she continued recording her debut album, and it became an instant smash on MTV, as well as cracking the American Top Ten. This lead Rolling Stone magazine to name her as one of the 'Top Ten Artists to Watch in 2002.'

The brainchild of guitarist/songwriter William J (Bill) Tsamis and drummer Mark S Zonder, Warlord made the trip from their native San Jose, California to Los Angeles and proceeded in crafting their unique style, which pioneered what is called today “Epic Power Metal."" The new band caught the attention of Brian Slagel, whose label, Metal Blade Records, had recently issued Metal Massacre, a compilation featuring up-and-coming local metal acts such as Malice, Steeler, Ratt, Slayer and Metallica. 

 An aficionado of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and admirer of the Euro-metal aesthetic, influences of which are evident in Warlord's sound, Slagel was impressed by Warlord's semi-progressive style inspired by such diverse acts as Rainbow, Scorpions and Jethro Tull. Slagel decided to offer the band a spot on his next compilation and Warlord would make their vinyl debut with ""Lucifer's Hammer"" on 1982's Metal Massacre II. Earning rave reviews, Warlord made a repeat appearance with ""Mrs Victoria"" on Metal Massacre III and were signed to Metal Blade for their 1983 Deliver Us album which got the band featured in important publications such as Kerrang, Sounds, Burrn, and Music Connection. Furthermore, Warlord was receiving continual FM radio play in major US markets.

Adding further intrigue to the growing Warlord mystique was the band members' use of pseudonyms such as 'Destroyer' / 'The Raven' (Tsamis), 'Thunderchild' (Zonder), 'Damien King' (vocalist Jack Rucker), and 'Sentinel' (keyboardist Diane Kornarens) as well as Warlord's refusal to become just another LA club act, opting to present themselves on a grander scale instead. To that end, the band rented The Raymond Theater to stage what would turn out to be the only Warlord live performance in the USA until now (August 2013). It was filmed and recorded for the group's first full-length release, ""And The Cannons Of Destruction Have Begun...,"" issued in October 1984 and accompanied by a VHS home video release of the same name (now in DVD). The album featured 2 brand new tracks, ""Soliloquy"" and ""MCMLXXXIV"", as well as both cuts from the ""Lost And Lonely Days"" / ""Aliens"" 12"" single released earlier that same year. Tsamis, Zonder, and Kornarens were joined by bassist Dave Watry ('Archangel') and new vocalist Rick Cunningham ('Damien King II').  A third vocalist worked shortly afterwards with the band (even if just in studio-recording and never on a stage): Rick Anderson, also known at the time as ""Damien King III"".

The prevalence of “hair metal,"" ""rap music,"" and the inability to retain a live lineup that could be up to Tsamis' and Zonder's high standards led to the cessation of band operations in 1986. The band's label, Metal Blade, would issue ""Thy Kingdom Come"", a quasi Best-Of, in December of that year. An extended version, including the whole Deliver Us album, followed in 1989, titled ""Best of Warlord."" Unbeknownst to Tsamis and Zonder, however, the music of Warlord had already taken off in Europe, and the band amassed a cult-like following.  This was largely due to rave magazine reviews, continuous radio play, and the circulation of many demos via ""tape trading,"" as well as positive word-of-mouth promotion among metal fans.  With the onset of the internet, the music of Warlord spread worldwide and thus helped secure Warlord a place in the history of heavy metal as one of the greatest metal bands of all time for both artistic integrity as well as their unique melodic style.

Post 1986, found Tsamis recording first an acoustic demo under the name “Lordian Winds” as part of a sprawling project based on John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" (released in 2012 by NoRemorse records) and then launching an apocalyptic-themed female-fronted band called Lordian Guard. In the meantime, Zonder joined Prog Metal pioneers Fates Warning and went on to release numerous albums with them as well as other bands since (due to his universally recognized talent) his skills were -and still are- in high demand.

It was during one of Fates Warning's tours that Zonder realized that Warlord's following had grown considerably with fans approaching him to sign Warlord albums and demanding new music from the band. Zonder contacted Tsamis and, as soon as schedules permitted, Warlord was once again converted to active status. Vocalist duties were assigned to Hammerfall vocalist (and big Warlord fan) Joacim Cans.  Thus, in 2002, a new album, ""Rising Out Of The Ashes,"" was recorded and released worldwide to rave reviews.  And this was followed by the first ever Warlord live performance at the Wacken Open Air festival.

A string of mishaps and very serious family health issues plagued Warlord after these performances and Warlord was once again, put on a hiatus which lasted for almost 9 years. With these issues resolved and considerable pressure by fans and promoters alike, Warlord returned to active status formally in March 2012, with the surprise release of the first new Warlord song in 10 years.  “Night Of The Fury” was first released on Warlord's fan club (and in general) on Facebook where it was also revealed that not only was Warlord back in the studio working on a new album, but that vocalist duties would be handled by one of the original 80s Warlord vocalists, Rick Anderson (whose stint in Italian band Martiria had just ended).  Philip Bynoe (current Steve Vai) joined the band on bass and the collaboration resulted in a new 55 minute album, ""The Holy Empire,"" which quickly sold out, leading to ongoing re-pressings.  ""The Holy Empire"" was also released on all major digital platforms as well as a collector's edition limited-release cassette which sold out in under one day. A vinyl 2 LP version (with a live bonus track) of ""The Holy Empire"" will be released in October 2013 by Alone Records.

In the meantime, mounting pressure by promoters and fans bore fruit and Warlord announced that it would headline the April 2013 German ""Keep It True XVI"" Festival. This announcement was followed by two more headlining dates in Greece - Thessaloniki and Athens which sold out, thus demanding a second show in Athens which was sold out as well. 

“The Holy Empire,"" has received numerous rave reviews from the international metal press and has been featured in almost all major in-print publications as well as internet-only outlets the world over.  In April 2013 Warlord took the full page cover of the prestigious Greek Metal Hammer print magazine.

Currently Warlord is working on their fifth yet-unnamed full length studio release as well as overseeing the production of a Blu-Ray/DVD/Double CD combo shot in HD video and audio during the Athens concerts.

In September 2013, on a radio interview, Tsamis and Zonder announced that lead vocalist duties for Warlord had been assigned to Nicholas Leptos of Arrayan Path.

They were originally inspired by and associated with the burgeoning UK punk rock scene, appearing on [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/53965-Various-The-Roxy-London-WC2-Jan-Apr-77]""The Roxy London WC2 (Jan - Apr 77)""[/url] (a key document of the groups of the early scene), and were later central to the development of post-punk, influencing endless bands over the subsequent decades. Hence, the group is often cited as one of the more important rock groups of the 1970's and 1980's. Critic Stewart Mason wrote, ""Over their brilliant first three albums, Wire expanded the sonic boundaries of not just punk, but rock music in general.""

Wire are arguably a definitive art punk or post-punk ensemble, mostly due to their richly detailed and atmospheric sound, often obscure lyrical themes, and, to a lesser extent, their Situationist political stance. The group exhibited a steady development from an early raucous punk style with 1977's [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/50645-Wire-Pink-Flag]""Pink Flag""[/url] to a more complex, structured sound involving increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers on both 1978's [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/50617-Wire-Chairs-Missing]""Chairs Missing""[/url] and 1979's [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/50606-Wire-154]""154""[/url]. The band gained a reputation for experimenting with song arrangements throughout its career.

For several years they made tapes for their own amusement, never once thinking anyone else would be interested.  It wasn't really important whether anyone else was interested, and that's one of the main reasons why WOO music works so well, and why it defies all attempts at defining what ""kind"" of music it is.  It is music which delights in its own existence, and in the process, charms the listener like nothing else.  It was 1981 before anyone else suggested the world might like a listen, too, and the result was ""Whichever way you are going, you are going wrong"".  Released in the U.K. in 1982, it received rave critical reviews in the difficult to please British press.

Initially describing themselves as alternative, indie rock, lofi jazz, synth & nostalgic acoustic guitar music, the Ives brothers eventually shifted to albums described as ambient, new age, spiritual, angelic, instrumental music for meditation, relaxation & healing."
