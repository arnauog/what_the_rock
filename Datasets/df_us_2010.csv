Variations of the Louisville native's magnetic delivery continues to crop up in young groups hoping to achieve even a sliver of the respect and adoration those progenitors earned within the scene.

Rounded out by bassist Bryan Todd, Nick Stinnett on drums and guitarist Matt Wieder, who cut his teeth in the early '90s hardcore outfit Mouthpiece, as well as River City rock staples The Enkindels, Frontier(s)' manages to seamlessly bridge the gap between the melodic, ethereal indie rock of Higdon's Elliott-era material and the blistering hardcore punk of the other members' earlier efforts.

Much like the city it calls home, Frontier(s) is hopelessly Midwestern. Louisville never accepted east or west coast definitions of post-anything, and the quartet is no different. Serrating guitars, tightly wound bass, and dime-stop drums are the brick to Higdon's mortar as he switches between airy tones and boot-shaking roar. The band channels enough hardcore angst and Husker Du-style buzzsaw guitar to make even the most jaded scenester flip their wig, while featuring pounding rhythms and a swirling wall of sound that land the listener somewhere smack in the middle of post-punk England and Washington D.C.'s Revolution Summer."

The project is formed with multiple band members including Mark Burgess, Yves Altana, Achim Färber, Jack Sobel & John Kolbeck of ""The Messengers"", Kwasi Asante who played on the last big Chameleons tour and album and a few other folks who provided some backup sounds.
After the live shows, the 'experiments' that were taped in the studio started to sound like something that should be not only recorded but also heard and appreciated.
There is no real theme that needed to be followed during recordings, but instead, a true evolution of sounds and appreciation for all types of music.
Songs recorded were meant not to grow old and stale but to give an impression of true feeling and spirit.
Memories of sitting around with friends in awe at the sound of ""The Chameleons"" and ""The Sun & The Moon"" was a true inspiration of getting this unique sound back out there.
""A Long Way From Home"" was worked on between concerts in 2006 and on into 2007.
The project is both original and diverse, bringing many cultures and influences together as one.

Throughout their 40-year career they have had a rotating cast of more than 10 bass players and have released more than 20 studio albums. Their current bassist is [a492942]. They perform under the name ""Melvins Lite"" with Trevor Dunn on stand-up bass and under the name ""Melvins 1983"" with Dale on bass instead of drums, in reference to the early incarnation of the band circa 1983 before Dale played the drums in the band. The name Melvins came from a grocery clerk at the Thriftway in Montesano where King Buzzo served as clerk and vandal. Melvin was the most hated fellow employee and they felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.

Originally known as the Lepers, the band made their name in the burgeoning punk scene where they would get together exclusively to play at parties, until they were picked up by 4AD. Richard Brown (Drums) and Stephen Walker (Keyboards) were subsequently added to the line-up of the band. A debut single, ""Drowning Man"" was released in 1980 on the Limp Records label. The band's debut full-length; ""Mesh & Lace"", released by 4AD a year later, it drew heavily on the gloomy post-punk sound already patented by bands such as Joy Division. The follow-up ""After The Snow"" showed a huge progression, as they introduced warmth and strong guitar harmonies (most notably on the minor classic ""I Melt With You""), rejecting the tinny bleakness of the debut. It was especially well received in the USA, and the band relocated to New York to consolidate a popularity encouraged by college radio. 1984's ""Ricochet Days"" had a crisper production but less creative experimentation. By the time of ""Stop Start"" (1986), the band had left 4AD and Walker and Brown had quit the band and Aaron Davidson (Keyboards, Guitar) had joined. Grey initially returned to England to form a new outfit, but reconvened Modern English in 1990 with Davidson and Conroy and released ""Pillow Lips"" on the TVT label in 1990. Robbie Grey with new band members Ted Mason (guitars) and Matthew Shipley (keyboards) co wrote and produced a second release for TVT though it received very little enthusiasm from the label. In 1995, the new Modern English line up recorded and released ""Everything's Mad"" on the Imago label. In 1998 the line up changed again, keeping Matthew Shipley and adding Steven Walker (guitars), Ian Robbins (bass) and Jon Solomon (drums). In 1999 Ian was replaced by Nik Williams (bass). In 2001 they recorded a new album 'Soundtrack' with producer Hugh Jones but due to the collapse of the record company it was shelved. Finally in 2010 this album was released by Darla. In 2009 the original band line up, minus Richard Brown, reformed and tour mainly in the US but also did shows in the UK, Europe and Asia. They wrote, recorded and self released a new album with Martyn Young (Colourbox) in 2017 called ‘Take Me To The Trees’. The band continue to tour and are currently working on their next album."

Kaura is a band formed in 2005 by Malcolm Guess and Benjamin Jones. The band has been invited to open for the likes of Tool, Rob Zombie, and Entrance Band by Bill Graham Presents in San Francisco. The band's sound is recognizable by its trademark use of ancient instruments like Hammered Dulcumer,Indonesian Gamelan, and Indian Tabla as well as delayed guitars, and an epic and aggressive sound. The band self-released a debut EP in 2005 which featured Paz Lenchantin from A Perfect Circle and Zwan on the track Dividing Lines. Guitarist Ben Rojas joined the band shortly after the band's first EP was recorded and after several bassists, Joshua Albright became a permanent member of the band.

Kaura released their first full-length album in Sept of 2011 which was packaged with a DVD that included two new music videos and an hour long making of the album documentary. Assisting in the creation of the album were notable engineers/mixers such as Sylvia Massy, known for her work with Tool, System of a Down, and Rick Rubin among others., Ken Andrews of the band's Failure and Year of the Rabbit, Alex Newport known for his work with At the Drive In, The Mars Volta, and his own band Fudge Tunnel. The artwork was created by Bay Area artist David Ho. Most of the album however was produced and mixed by Kaura's singer and guitarist Malcolm Guess.

Shortly following the release of their full-length album, Kaura successfully funded the making of an acoustic CD/DVD titled ""The Acoustic Sessions"", by the use of their Kickstarter.com campaign. Production of ""The Acoustic Sessions"" was completed in January 2012 and is set to be released in March 2012. ""The Acoustic Sessions"" features songs from both Kaura's Self Titled EP and their full-length album as well as one unreleased song.

In the summer of 2011 Kaura also worked with film director Seda James, writing the end credits song ""Awakening the Seed"" for his short film titled Subject 7. With strong support for its film festival debut, the full length continuum titled Subject 6 is slated for production over the next 2 years; of which ""Awakening the Seed"" is intended to be included in."

The Megas were formed by singers/guitarists Josh Breeding and Eric von Doymi while attending Cal State Long Beach. Bassist/backing vocalist Greg Schneider (ex-[a=Agent 51]) joined them, and the group went through early drummers Dave Jensen and Brent Firestone before Mike Levinson (also ex-Agent 51) joined and they released their first album, [i]Get Equipped[/i] (2008), based on the game [i]Mega Man 2[/i]. They next collaborated with the band Entertainment System for the [i]Megatainment[/i] EP (2009), based on the original [i]Mega Man[/i] video game. In 2010 The Megas released an acoustic version of [i]Get Equipped[/i] titled [i]Get Acoustic[/i], followed by the EP [i]Sparked A War[/i] which featured a track from an upcoming [i]Mega Man 3[/i]-themed project. Keyboardist Brian DiDomenico joined in 2011, moving the band more in a synth rock direction.

The [i]Mega Man 3[/i] project ultimately became a two-volume album. The first volume, [i]History Repeating: Blue[/i], was released in June 2012. Levinson left the band shortly afterward and was replaced by Greg Herschleb. The [i]Fly On A Dog[/i] EP was released that December, featuring a track from the second volume of the [i]Mega Man 3[/i] project, but the album itself, [i]History Repeating: Red[/i], did not materialize until May of 2014.

In 2016 The Megas released the EP [i]What A Horrible Night...[/i] under the alias The Belmonts, with songs based on the [i]Castlevania[/i] video games. They have since released two EPs as ""The Megas X The Belmonts"", featuring songs based on both [i]Mega Man[/i] and [i]Castlevania[/i] games: [i]Skulls[/i] (2018) and [i]Snakes[/i] (2020).

Supporting acts like Def Leppard, Crash Test Dummies and U2, they achieved unheard-of success locally as a live act and in raw sales figures and decided to relocate to London in 2000 after releasing three albums and an EP.

Their live performances were surreal vaudeville shows in which songs became full fledged production numbers.

Their second album, “Young And Rich,""  included their second hit single – the suggestive duet “Don't Touch Me There.""  The Tubes released three more albums on A&M before being dropped in 1982, slimming back down to the original lineup.

“The Completion Backward Principle,""  contained the hits, “Don't Want To Wait Anymore,"" “Sushi Girl,” and the classic rock staple “Talk To You Later.""  

Their next release on Capitol was ""Outside Inside,"" which featured the top 10 US single “She's A Beauty.""  

In 1985 The Tubes released “Love Bomb,"" which was not a commercial success and years of expensive tours left the band a half million dollars in debt.  Capitol dropped the Tubes and lead singer Fee Waybill left the band, with David Killngsworth joining as his replacement.  

The years that followed saw several personnel changes in the band, with Spooner, Cotten and Welnick all departed by mid-1989, and Waybill ultimately returning to the band in the 1990's.  While the Tubes have continued to release music, the fame and notoriety of the late 70's and early 80's remain as the bands true legacy."

Bass player and Madison native, Chris Boeger was asked to put together a band for a weekly afternoon gig in the patio of a sub par rib joint on the edge of town.  Recruiting long-time drummer and collaborator Scott Beardsley, as well as local music prankster Waylan Daniel, the trio set out to be the most unique cover band they could be.  Trying to keep the small crowd and themselves entertained, they played every style and genera of music they could think of.  From TV themes to disco to new wave to country, and everything in between, no stone was left unturned. Soon, they began performing at local bluegrass bars and rock clubs in Madison, and were crowned Best Cover Band by readers of the alternative weekly newspaper, Isthmus, within their first year of performing.

In a very short time, the trio found a musical personality and a commanding groove that has since been stirring up dance floors, clubs and wedding receptions all over the country.   The Sweethearts bring to mind your favorite band covering your other favorite band’s songs.   When they perform, it’s like hearing tracks you’ve always loved for the first time!

Their one-of-a-kind yet familiar sounds have been turning heads in some interesting places.  They were recently featured as the cocktail band in the Adam Sandler film, “That’s My Boy”.  They’ve also been spotlighted on the NPR radio program, “Whad’Ya Know”.  They’ve even played a set of music with Blues Traveler front man John Popper on harmonica, rolling through hits ranging from Johnny Cash to Duran Duran!  Their wide range of musical styles mirror their eclectic achievements.

The Hometown Sweethearts bill themselves as a “music lovers party band” because they’ve dug up a repertoire of songs that are timeless, relevant, and most importantly, not played out.  Their selections are so diverse, it’s not uncommon to hear Hall and Oats segue into Johnny Cash, or a Jackson 5 song mix into Madonna, then twist into Talking Heads without missing a beat.  And since this band has been playing together for so many years, they can effortlessly blend one song into the next without a pause.  They perform music like DJ’s make mixes! Once your dance floor is jumping, the Sweethearts make it nearly impossible to turn back.

With a catalogue nearing 400 songs, they have plenty of selections to please everyone.  They can perform the time-tested favorites, some of today’s latest hits, or dig deep into the soundtrack of your life.  They can even mix the obscure tunes with the classics without ever changing the party atmosphere.  

The band has just released their first all original music CD.  After thousands and thousands of hours of performing the greatest songs ever, they had a tall order creating songs that would stand up on the dance floor as well as the earphones.  It turns out they were up for the challenge.  On the record, the new songs are melodic, fun and powerful.  Live, the original tunes blend effortlessly with their steamrolling dance sets.   Even though the Hometown Sweethearts career began over 17 years ago, their life as a relevant original band is just beginning."

(Originally named Troop 101)

Soulful, fresh, genre-defying. These are only a few of the terms that immediately spark the mind when greeted with Anarbor’s gutsy and transcending EP, Free Your Mind. When noted that the aforementioned genre is pop-rock, it seems even more special that a band with this talent and bravado would push itself away from a scene where predetermined trappings threaten to undermine its singular integrity.
“We know that every single kid out there is tired of the same old dance-pop record that gets released every single week. Our goal is to be the music scene’s saving grace,” says guitarist Mike Kitlas. “It will tell our listeners that we are here to stay and we are not a fad band that will fade out as soon as dance-pop is outdated.”

Free Your Mind extends beyond the cut-and-paste albums being churned out, instead infusing dynamic guitars behind the soul-shaking howls and relatable melodies from frontman Slade Echeverria. Crafted in Los Angeles by producer Mike Green (Paramore, Good Charlotte) over a four-week span in Los Angeles, Free Your Mind's formation came from a desire to break out from the ""fad band"" chokehold and delve into what was real.
The EP's lyrical themes of drama-addled love are age-appropriate for this band still fresh from cap and gown status, yet show emerging maturity and growth while navigating the waters of life on the road and in the press, as well as their loss of anonymity. Not one track doesn’t contain a purpose or reason ripped from the band’s own personal headlines, and the EP title wasn’t without a conscious peek into their agenda, either.
“We want to challenge kids to think outside of the norm, and really find themselves, rather then just following what the crowd is doing,” Kitlas said. “We want to show our listeners that they are not alone, we all go through our struggles and everyone has their ups and downs in life.”
The seven-track EP, kicks off with a mischievous call to a wayward paramour on “Let The Games Begin,” before sliding into the instant hip-shaking grooves of “The Brightest Green,” a slice of Maroon 5-ish soul that takes on a life of its own. Anarbor takes a familiar formula but adds a warmth and genuineness to every guitar lick and lyric that keeps them relatable yet unique. Each track seamlessly follows the next, spinning clever lyrics and brisk guitars, and each adds another deft chapter to this memorable volume.

“The distinctive sound we are reaching for is rock and roll. We don't use any instruments in our songs that we don’t play live, we are going for a very raw and real sound for this record,” Kitlas said. When noted that shared influences range from Third Eye Blind to Red Hot Chili Peppers, it’s even more apparent where the EP’s driving and fully-executed rock-based energy gained its roots.
The easy nature and chemistry of the band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2003 is more than just a cosmic luck for an emerging band. Because this, in years of formation, is by no means a freshman band. Echeverria and Kitlas became friends in grade school, and continued to grow up experiencing many life-changing events together, securing a bond that eventually extended to music, and a decision to make it their ultimate ambition. The band signed to Hopeless Records before they even received their high school diplomas.
More than just a sum of its parts, the writing process for Anarbor is a group united, with each member adding input in acoustic jam sessions that allows everyone to collaborate and contribute creatively. It’s a cohesion that allowed each member’s personal preferences and talents shine when it came to recording.

Sharing the stage with everyone from Fall Out Boy to the Gin Blossoms, as well as a coveted spot on this year’s Take Action! Tour, Anarbor is gaining steady recognition as the diverse band to watch among a sea of faux rock ‘n rollers. This motivated and utterly gifted band will resonate with any listener who knows a thing or two about learning who you are and putting your ambitions into motion.
“We want people to walk away feeling comforted and confident in themselves,” Kitlas said. “Music is a universal language that everyone can relate to. We talk about our real life stories, feelings and situations. You can expect real music and real lyrics, no filler.”

More recently, Anarbor independently released their eponymous third studio album entitled, “Anarbor” in June of 2016. The album was self-funded and produced by long-time collaborator Matt Keller (Lydia, The Maine, The Summer Set, Katastro). Anarbor is comprised of lead vocalist and bassist Slade Echeverria, guitarist Adam Juwig and guitarist Danny Stravers.

Line-up:
Tyler Owen - guitars, keys, vocals, random instrumentation (The Bottom Line, Tribal Eye, Loveseat, Grasshopper Takeover, Citrus)

Former musicians:
Peter Rom - guitar
Billy Slater - drums

Perhaps the title of THE EYE's debut album sums up the self-perceived life of frontman Tyler Owen. """"The Joy of Diving"" is both the fear of success and the love of failure,"" Owen says. ""Ultimately, it's about skirting responsibility for your own actions. In my own experience, I've always had something to fall back on, alleviating the necessity of success."" That may be true in his mind, but to the outside observer, nothing could be farther from the truth.

The EYE has been rocking the Far West and West Coast for nearly six years, sharing the stage with heavy-hitters 311, The Samples, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Winebottles and many more. Their mix of poppy yet creative alternative rock has won them fans throughout their local scenes, whether it be in Colorado, California or Nebraska.

A natural born musician, Owen, born and raised in the cornfields of Omaha, NE (not literally, of course), has been playing and producing music since he was thirteen years old. His first band, The Bottom Line, modeled themselves after old-school rockers The Replacements. ""Two of the guys were in the school band,"" Owen recalls. ""On Friday nights in the fall when we had a gig (usually at one of the Catholic girls' schools) the two bandies would be busy performing at our high school's football games. That left our keyboardist and myself the responsiblity of setting up the equipment. Inevitably and invariably, we would instead drink warm beer out of his trunk in the parking lot before the shows...we didn't play a single, sober show until our last gig in high school, as a matter of fact. It's a bit embarrassing.""

In the last seven years, however, Owen has been clear headed enough to record or release nine full-length recordings. Two with Colorado-based Tribal Eye, three with his former band Loveseat (their album, ""Applehands and Yellowcans"" went on to sell approximately 16,000 copies), one solo project (which sold over 6,000 copies), one for fellow Nebraskans Grasshopper Takeover, one for Miltona's own Citrus and his latest project, THE EYE.

In 1995, Owen and bassist Jason Kirby teamed up with guitarist Jesper Andreasson to form the band Loveseat. Eventually they completed the group with drummer Chris Novicki, whom Owen had met while an extra on the set of ""Murder, She Wrote"" (don't ask). Loveseat played the LA club circuit for nearly two years, and released three albums: ""...Day and a Half"", ""Chet's Chicken Shack"" and ""Applehands and Yellowcans"". Citing a need for a ""normal life,"" bassist Kirby left the band in 1998 to enroll in law school in San Diego.

Owen immediately went on to begin work on The Eye's debut release, which had then become his own pseudo-solo project. Bassist Kirby would come up during breaks in law school to track the bass, and friend Dean Butterworth (from Ben Harper's Innocent Criminals) would sit in on drums.

Slated for a March 28th release, ""The Joy of Diving"" is a fascinating blend of traditional alternative-rock. The album includes a somewhat electronic interpretation of The Cure's ""Killing An Arab"" and a straitforward approach to Joy Division's ""Ceremony"". ""People are always asking me why I do covers on my records,"" Owen explains. ""I guess it's my way of paying homage to the bands I idolized growing up. I don't write songs in their style, yet it's fun to add those songs to the overall feel of the record. If I could get away with doing a whole cover record, I would. And someday I might."""

12834,255151,2320684,US,Devo,Something For Everybody,2010,37.93,12,['Album'],['Rock'],"['New Wave', 'Synth-pop']","New-wave group popular throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, formed by a group of art students at Kent State University, principally Mark Mothersbaugh and Jerry Casale. Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.

During the four years that Screwtractor was together, recording for MCA and touring the country with their powerful, dramatic music that blended metal, gothic and industrial influences, Kae was also developing a personal musical vision. When Screwtractor broke up in 1995, Kae started to work on that vision in his practice space, adding and subtracting other musicians based on their ability to relate what he was trying to do. "

Consisting of Sean Kirkpatrick (vocals, keyboards), Ian Hamilton (keyboards) and Robe﻿rt Anderson (drums), the band released Out of Sync with Time on Milwaukee's Latest Flame Records in 2010. 2012’s Fake Infinity dialed down the piano that defined much of its early material in favor of an expansive sonic attack of black space organ and jagged synthesizers. The band spent the subsequent two years supporting its second album, playing hundreds of shows, large and small. Nervous Curtains kept a low profile throughout the majority of 2014 while recording and producing its third album, Con, and other still-forthcoming releases. In the meantime, Kirkpatrick played synthesizer and piano on Swans’ To Be Kind.﻿

Con is the trio's most raw and confident album to date. The album plays up the rhythmic tension between pulsing synthesizers and live drums while merging these elements into a blast of defiant energy and enduring tunes. With this album, Nervous Curtains has created a space in which paranoia is a cultural commodity amidst a battleground of convictions and contradictions The band again worked with seasoned engineer Matthew Barnhart as well as This Will Destroy You’s Alex Bhore and received some co-production perspective and guest vocal assistance from Pinkish Black’s Daron Beck."

Boasting a beautiful but potent style of post-progressive/alternative/pop they like to refer to as kaleidoscope rock, MAID MYRIAD blends dynamically versatile songs, angst-fueled progressive riffs, delicate pin drop moments, and intense start/stop dynamics. The band formed in 2007, quickly solidifying their name within the local scene, receiving heavy regional airplay from their debut EP Embrace, being named Akron’s second best local band in 2010 (behind The Black Keys), logging miles in the van, and opening for such national acts as Primus, Gogol Bordello, Dax Riggs, Michale Graves, Maps & Atlases, As Tall As Lions and more.

Guitarist, singer, and songwriter, [a4620178] (ex-Via Lotus), and drummer [a4022443] ([a4150291]), have recently wrapped-up recording MAID MYRIAD’s first full-length album, [i][r12175991][/i]. With a dozen new songs radiating with the band’s most exceptionally-crafted songwriting through their most expansive and explosive material to date, With Haste On Its Breath is an hour-long opus that is as beautiful as it is infectious. Bursting with influences from a gamut of rock subgenres, one can hear elements of Sense Field, Serpico, Sunny Day Real Estate and others born of the 1990s post-hardcore/emo circuit, massive alternative rock elements of Dredg, later Cave In and the mellowest aspects of the Dillinger Escape Plan’s more recent recordings, relentless creativity on the level of Tool and Mike Patton’s catalog and so on, all seamlessly honed and brought to vibrant life with a passionate, dynamic, clean vocal delivery. Recorded in both Akron, Ohio, and Keyport, New Jersey, produced and engineered by Klemm at Free Truman Productions, and then mixed and mastered by Kevin Antreassian at Backroom Studios in Rockaway, New Jersey (The Dillinger Escape Plan, Adrenaline Mob, Foxy Shazam, etc.), the album’s artwork and layout was crafted by Eric Nyffeler at Doe-Eyed (East Of The Wall, A Fucking Elephant).

While MAID MYRIAD has been comprised of Jeff Klemm and Greg Meisenberg, the duo is now joined by bassist Mario Tonathy, whom the band toured with heavily throughout 2013. With Tonathy now a full-time member of the band, MAID MYRIAD will take back to the streets, promoting the new album across the US throughout the latter half of 2014 and beyond.

[i][r12175991][/i] will see a six-panel digipak CD and digital release October 7th via [l545739], the independent label founded by members of MAID MYRIAD, [a4150291], [a6554537] and more, and the home of a bunch of big, dumb noise.

Later band members included Neil Finn's brother [a247008], [a437425] and Americans [a418822] and [a847062]. 

Mark Hart who had toured with the group joined as a permanent member in 1993. Founding drummer Hester left in the band in May 1994 citing family reasons. He briefly returned for their ""Farewell to the World"" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996 and also played on three new tracks recorded for the album ""Recurring Dream"" (1996). His replacement was Peter Jones who remained with the group until they disbanded in 1996.

On 26 March 2005, Hester died by suicide. In 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums in 2007 and 2010.

In November 2016 they were inducted into the ARIA (Australian Recording Industry Association) Hall of Fame.

On 9 December 2019, Neil Finn unveiled via his official web site that the band's new line-up - alongside himself and Seymour - would add [a55974], [a592970] and [a842515]. As a result, Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod would no longer participate.

Although other New Zealand solo acts have topped the US charts, the group hold the distinction of being the only New Zealand band to have made it to #2 in the US Billboard Singles chart, with their single ""Don't Dream It's Over""."

The band is often also cited as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous."

Led by guitarist Vernon Reid, the bands lineup solidified in the mid-80's w/ Corey Glover (vocals), Will Calhoun (drums) and Muzz Skillings (bass). Stylistically, the band's music is a creative fusion influenced by free jazz, funk, hard rock and heavy metal. Their lyrics range from the personal to the political, in some of the latter cases attacking Eurocentrism and racism in America. 

The band’s debut album, “Vivid,” was released in 1988 on Epic Records. The album reached #6 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and was later certified double platinum by the RIAA. It featured “Cult of Personality,” a #13 hit on the Billboard 200 Singles chart as well as the Top 40 hit, “Glamour Boys.” “Cult of Personality” went on to earn the band their first Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. 

In 1990 the band's second full-length album, “Time's Up,” was released and reached #13 on the Billboard 200 while certifying gold. It won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Album and featured guest appearances by Queen Latifah, Little Richard, Doug E. Fresh, and Maceo Parker. 

Living Colour released the 6-song EP, ""Biscuits"" which coincided with the inaugural Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991.

Skillings left the band in the summer of 1992, replaced by session veteran and Sugarhill Records bass player Doug Wimbish.

“Stain,” their third LP, was released in 1993 by Epic. Reaching #26 on the Billboard 200, the album had a much heavier and aggressive sound, containing elements of thrash metal and industrial music while receiving a Grammy nomination for 'Leave It Alone'.

After a split in 1995, Living Colour returned in December 2000 and began recording “Collideøscope”. Released in 2003, the album featured aggressive lyrics, with many of the songs about the September 11 attacks. It also contained cover versions of AC/DC's “Back in Black” and The Beatles' “Tomorrow Never Knows.” 

Their first release on Megaforce Records, “The Chair in the Doorway,” was issued in 2009 and reached #159 on the Billboard 200 charged by the single 'Behind The Sun'

In 2013, the band celebrated the 25th anniversary of 'Vivid' w/ a world tour crossing North and South Americas, Europe, and Japan, including the Soundwave festival in Australia.

The root of Living Colour's next album, came from a performance of Robert Johnson's ""Preachin' Blues"" at the 100th Anniversary Birthday celebration at the legendary Apollo in New York City. 

Released on September 8, 2017, ‘Shade’ is the sound of a band coming to terms with its shadows and light,” says founder Vernon Reid. “From the blue pulpit of Robert Johnson to the mean red streets of Brooklyn... ‘Shade’ is the next chapter of a unique American journey.” "

During their spring semester, they began experimenting with samples, recording software and guitars, making music with the atmospheric sweep of symphonic and electronic pop and the intimacy of folk. Initially, Rossen and Nicolaus intended their music to be heard just by their friends, but California indie label Isota Records released the duo's debut EP, Mo' Tussin, in 2002 and The Noam Chomsky Spring Break EP the following year. Those EPs, plus some extra studio records, were compiled to make The Whitey on the Moon UK LP, which Isota also issued in 2003. However, upon discovering a San Francisco band also with the name the Whitey on the Moon, Rossen and Nicolaus changed their project's name to Department of eagles, and the album's name was changed to The Cold Nose and issued in the UK by Melodic in 2005 and reissued in the US with four bonus tracks by American Dust in 2007. Meanwhile, in 2004, Rossen joined Grizzly Bear in time to contribute tracks to their breakthrough album, 2006's Yellow House; that year, Department of Eagles' odds-and-ends EP A Johnny Glaze Christmas: Classical Snatches and Samples a Go-Go was released. During that time, Rossen and Nicolaus continued to work on tracks, gathering enough material for an album by late 2007. Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor and Christopher bear, as well as bassist Nat Baldwin, joined Rossen and Nicolaus for the sessions, which were completed in spring 2008. The resulting album, In Ear Park, was inspired by Rossen's late father and released by 4AD that fall. The odds-and-ends collection Archive 2003-2006, which included tracks from their aborted sophomore album and pieces that were later used by Grizzly Bear, arrived in 2010."

Under the alias The Belmonts, they give a similar treatment to music from the [i]Castlevania[/i] video game series; Several releases feature the band performing under both monikers and are credited to ""The Megas X The Belmonts"".

The Megas were formed by singers/guitarists Josh Breeding and Eric von Doymi while attending Cal State Long Beach. Bassist/backing vocalist Greg Schneider (ex-[a=Agent 51]) joined them, and the group went through early drummers Dave Jensen and Brent Firestone before Mike Levinson (also ex-Agent 51) joined and they released their first album, [i]Get Equipped[/i] (2008), based on the game [i]Mega Man 2[/i]. They next collaborated with the band Entertainment System for the [i]Megatainment[/i] EP (2009), based on the original [i]Mega Man[/i] video game. In 2010 The Megas released an acoustic version of [i]Get Equipped[/i] titled [i]Get Acoustic[/i], followed by the EP [i]Sparked A War[/i] which featured a track from an upcoming [i]Mega Man 3[/i]-themed project. Keyboardist Brian DiDomenico joined in 2011, moving the band more in a synth rock direction.

The [i]Mega Man 3[/i] project ultimately became a two-volume album. The first volume, [i]History Repeating: Blue[/i], was released in June 2012. Levinson left the band shortly afterward and was replaced by Greg Herschleb. The [i]Fly On A Dog[/i] EP was released that December, featuring a track from the second volume of the [i]Mega Man 3[/i] project, but the album itself, [i]History Repeating: Red[/i], did not materialize until May of 2014.

In 2016 The Megas released the EP [i]What A Horrible Night...[/i] under the alias The Belmonts, with songs based on the [i]Castlevania[/i] video games. They have since released two EPs as ""The Megas X The Belmonts"", featuring songs based on both [i]Mega Man[/i] and [i]Castlevania[/i] games: [i]Skulls[/i] (2018) and [i]Snakes[/i] (2020).

Growing up in Mamaroneck, New York, high school memories are “driving to the Bronx at lunch time for bags of crappy pot sprayed with hairspray to make it seem more bud-like.” He left that all behind in order to study philosophy at Plymouth State College. Quitting after two years, he traveled around the U.S., hitting 42 of the 50 states. He moved into Portsmouth in 1987, resuming his studies at UNH while enjoying public transportation (though he had a car) as it “provided a lot of fodder for stories because freaky people take the bus,” and graduated with his philosophy degree in 1989.
Between 1988 and the birth of his record label Two Ton Santa, Guy was in the bands Fancy Pants, Toast, Size of Guam, The Driveways, Up-a-Tree, Beekeeper, The Pants, Bob & Guy, and The Crotch Wax Menace, “and probably some others I’m forgetting as well,” he guesses.
Sometimes, it was a one- or two-gig existence for the band, sometimes not. Sometimes, it was just a matter of trading musicians in and out of bands because everyone was connected to the same people and places. He played with the country band The Buckets, now based out of San Francisco, and comprised of Ray Halliday, Mary Lou Lord and Carrie Bradley. He headed up Two Ton Santa (the band, not the label), a two bass, drums and guitar ensemble with one singer. Guy’s band Milk of Magnesia, “a psychedelic band, almost,” opened their first show at The Rat with a faux imbibing of magnesia milk, inspiring audience members to volunteer their own drinking efforts, only they swallowed the real thing, which Guy seems to think they enjoyed quite a bit.

The band, originally a trio consisting of Spekis, Craig, and Vavro, formed in the spring of 2008 and quickly released their debut, ‘EP’, on June 17, 2008. ‘EP’ was completed in do-it-yourself fashion with the members tackling all duties themselves (writing, recording, releasing, and distributing), their only background education coming from the school of trial-and-error.
In the spring of 2009, Satin Gum added a fourth member, Jonathan Gunnell, on guitar and keyboards. Gunnell was a longtime friend of the band and had attended many of their early shows. He was somewhat reluctant to join at first due to an already busy work/school schedule, but he was bribed by The Gum with external hard drives, a troll doll collection, and unlimited cold beers.
Satin Gum digitally released their first full-length album, ‘LP’, on August 27, 2009. A CD release followed in September. This effort was recorded & engineered by lead Gum dude Spekis with Gunnell handling mixing & mastering.
On July 22, 2010, Satin Gum released ‘EP2′ which was regarded as the “most underrated local release of the year” by Andy Mulkerin of Pittsburgh’s City Paper. This was the first Satin Gum release where the mastering job was assigned to someone outside of the band, one Garrett Haines (of TreeLady Studios) who declared, “This album screams “HIT ME HARD!”
Satin Gum’s latest effort, ‘EP3′, was released on September 20, 2011. 
Since their inception, Satin Gum has shared the stage with prominent musical artists such as Jesse Malin, Frightened Rabbit, Smith Westerns, We Are Scientists, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, Cymbals Eat Guitars, and French Kicks. The Gum’s songs have been placed in major television shows such as The Good Wife on CBS.
No strangers to a delectable chow, the band members are often seen in their downtime enjoying a sandwich known as the “Leroy Brown”, a half-pound of Angus topped off with homemade BBQ sauce, sugar-glazed peppercorn bacon, and cheddar cheese."

After releasing their first album in 2010, ""Twisted Roots"", Seedless toured nationally year after year with acts like Soja, The Expendables, Stick Figure and Tribal Seeds. Bringing an energetic performance and soul-filled sound, Seedless, led by vocalist Matthew Liufau, has gained a loyal fan base across the country. 

The group continued to produce music with Lewis Richards at 17th Street Studios for several years. Carefully choosing what to release, singles like, ""Baby Don't Go"", ""Bullet"", and ""Friends"" gave fans a glimpse into the direction of the band, and what they might expect from their much anticipated sophomore release, ""The Orange Album.""
In early 2016, two members left the band, Casey Sullivan (vocals/guitar) and Grant Rivera (bass).  Each with a business and family of their own, Casey and Grant wished the band the best as they chose to stop playing.

The other members of Seedless, Matthew Liufau (vocals), Shay Pino (drums), Joe Bakhos (guitar) and Anthony Wells (keyboards) kept touring. They picked up hired musicians, J-Bird (bass) and Jason J (guitar/harmonies) to help fill out the live sound. Matt’s sister, Essel, has also been added to the lineup, bringing her dynamic presence and skillfully trained vocals. 

Between playing shows with Iration, The Expendables and many more, Seedless finished their long awaited Orange Album, announcing it's release date: September 30th, 2016.
Although fans have begged for more frequent releases, Seedless has upheld a high standard in their production quality and musicianship. Their unique blend of musical styles transcends genre barriers and makes certain to get their fans moving and thinking by weaving tight grooves with meaningful messages."

By blending smooth melodic riffing, heavy edge up beat rhythms, and harmonious, emotion filled vocals, Saturate is able to achieve all extremes of the musical spectrum in a tasteful way. But what stands out the most, is the live performance.. Its not about glam, gimmicks or choreography.. just pure, energetic, interactive entertainment.

The basis of the band was conjured up in New Orleans, LA. by Mike Mexas (guitar) who relocated himself to the Houston area in search of better opportunities, and musicians with a similar approach. Thus proving to be quite effective. A four song ep/demo was immediately released in which hundreds, if not thousands of copies were handed out as promotional tools. Saturate was soon playing shows 2-3 times a week and by the summer of 2006 their debut album ""Soul Element"" was released and soon acquired [independent] distribution. Saturate had become a well know band in the Houston and surrounding areas and by 2007 had began to venture out of state on small, independently booked, 2-3 week tours. The word was out and Saturate soon had acquired a broad, underground national fan base as well as a European following.

They have since shared the stage with many well known acts such as Korn, Chevelle, Five Finger Death Punch, Drowning Pool, Ill Nino, Otep, Nonpoint, Taproot and many more. Not to mention several national tours with close friends Flaw. 

Saturate has just wrapped up their third album release (e.p.) titled ""Damage the Memory"" as a follow up to the 2010 full length album ""The Point of No Return"". Plans for 2013 tour dates are in the works as well as a fourth upcoming record, yet to be titled.

The Muffs started as a collaboration between guitarists Kim Shattuck and Melanie Vammen, both former members of the 1980s all-female hard rock group, [a=The Pandoras]. The band started performing and recording after the addition of bassist Ronnie Barnett (Shattuck's then-boyfriend) and drummer Criss Crass.  Following the release of their first album in 1993, Crass left the band.  By the time the band recorded their second LP, 1995's ""Blonder and Blonder"", Melanie Vammen had departed and Roy McDonald was the group's drummer.  This would become The Muffs' definitive line-up.  That same year, the band released one of their best-known songs, a cover of [a=Kim Wilde]'s ""Kids In America"", for the soundtrack to the movie ""Clueless"" (ironically, it was a song that the band reportedly neither liked nor ever performed live).  After 2004's ""Really, Really Happy"" LP the band went on extended hiatus, not returning to action until 2012 (Kim Shattuck credited former drummer Jim Lespesa, who filled in on tour after Chris Crass left, with bringing her, Ronnie Barnett, and Roy McDonald back together).  The band recorded a new album, ""Whoop Dee Doo"" that year but its release was delayed when Shattuck was offered the bass-playing slot in the [a=Pixies].  Her Pixies stint was famously short-lived and the album was released in 2014.  The band's final album, ""No Holiday"" was released in October 2019, shortly after Shattuck's death from complications related to ALS."

As far as we can remember the first incarnation of Treadmill Trackstar occured in 1992.  Yup – that’s a long time ago.  We got some lucky regional radio play with our first indie record Excessive Use of the Passive Voice which came out in 1994.  We spent the next few years endlessly touring the country garnishing a loyal grassroots following through good old hard work. It was fun.
The touring came to a climax in the summer of 1997 when Treadmill was lucky enough to hit the summer festival circuit with the likes of Beck, Moby, Garbage, Iggy Pop, Four Non Blondes, and more –  and had the chance to perform for huge crowds beyond our wildest dreams.
All this hard work paid off in 1997 when Treadmill Trackstar was signed to the Atlantic Records imprint label Breaking Records. After a valiant stab at rock and roll fame, we were dropped a year later as part of a typical Band/Record Company story that you’ve already heard a million times.
The band attempted to go on, but the diligent work ethic that had worked so well also took a toll on band members who decided to jump off the Treadmill in 1998 to pursue other interests.
Fast forward to 2007. A group of promoters contacted the ex-members of Treadmill Trackstar about getting back together to perform at a charity concert celebrating the legendary Columbia music venue, Rockafella’s. After much gnashing of teeth – we somehow made it onto the stage to perform to an amazing crowd where we realized something that we had forgotten – music can be fun.
The band made 4 fan funded records over the next several years.
The band will play their final show and release the final EP in 2017.

With skills and artistry this former DJ and MC turned singer/songwriter, strives to take everyone to a higher level of consciousness. 

He started his musical career spinning records in the clubs of South Florida but the innately poetic performer’s musical roots were more clearly witnessed when he joined the groundbreaking, progressive reggae group: Le Coup, with Richard and Anthony Booker. In fact, family matriarch Cedella Marley Booker told young Kēvens very early in his musical career: ""Like a letter, you must write a song with purpose.""

This spiritual artist's message is always at the center of his art and his life. 
Kēvens' intricate concert performances and visualizations are pure conceptual theater. His goal is timeless and transcendent: to bring all races, cultures and creeds together. Kēvens’s lush drum 'n' bass amalgam of vocal dexterity and musicianship, mixed with a progressive rocking-reggae dub style and stunning dance as well as visual imagery. 

His knack for the timely and profound has enabled him to tour all over the world and finds him along side an eclectic array of legends and prodigies including: Steven Tyler,The Prodigy, Sander Kleinenberg, Carlos Santana, The Jacksons, Paul Van Dyk, The Chemical Brothers, Moby, Crystal Method, Roni Size Reprazent, in recent times.


This global citizen is a performance artist who coined the ultimate mantra: 
“Positivity is a Necessity”.

Boston, MA
Hailing from the great Northwest, where he was a founding member of the pop-noise band Frequency dB, Peter Buzzelle is a singer/songwriter that can best be described as a devotee to guitar-centered Power Pop in the tradition of Big Star, The Posies, and The Shins. Dig a little deeper, though, and you’ll find additional layers that demonstrate a keen sense of song craft featuring a dichotomy of joy and melancholy mixed into a style heavy on melodic hooks, original riffs, and the occasional odd time signature.
Shortly after his move to Boston, Buzzelle teamed up with producer/musician Chris Zerby (of Boston’s Helicopter Helicopter) to release two highly regarded full-length records, “To Telescope” and “Museum Of”, which saw him flexing a bit of rock guitar muscle while keeping one foot firmly planted in his Power Pop roots.
“Museum Of is full of Buzzelle’s astute and catchy as hell power pop, and at times it reminds us of the finest moments in the aforementioned genre such as The Posies’ Frosting On The Beater, Matthew Sweet’s Girlfriend, and Big Star’s landmark #1 Record, while creating something engaging, original, and completely addicting.” –Bryan Hamill – The Ash Gray Proclamation, May 2012
Firmly established in the Boston music scene, Peter changed his approach in 2014 by going for more of a full-band vibe for his next recording, “Sea of White”, a 5 song EP recorded at Boston’s famed Q Division Studios.  Co-produced by Craig Small (Airport) and Chris Zerby, and featuring some of Boston’s top-notch players (Craig Small on guitar, Chuck Ferreira on Drums, Ken Rothman on guitar, Matt Girard on Bass and James Rohr on keyboards), “Sea of White” garnered even more attention and saw Buzzelle signing with indie rock label, Hidden Trail Records.
Accolades for the record were strong:  “Sea Of White might be the best EP of 2014 to date and opener “I’m Gonna Know You” might be the best power ballad I’ve heard in years, with a swelling, catchy chorus, while “Till Death Do Us Part” and “Happiness and Misery” are a couple of excellent Posies/Matthew Sweet-styled rockers, “Our Life is the Song” closes things out in hooky fashion.” –Absolute Powerpop Blogspot
In 2015 “Peter Buzzelle and The Academy” was born, in order to keep a more collaborative and consistent band approach intact, followed by a string of successful shows in the Boston area.
Drawing from the core members of “The Academy”, recording began during the winter of 2016 at 1867 Studios with engineer and co-producer, James Bridges, at the helm. The result, “Devil Love” (released in September of 2016), may very well be Peter’s strongest work to date, featuring a diverse suite of songs that represent the full range of his core influences and writing style. Featuring Ken Rothman on guitar, Chuck Ferreira on drums, and Jamie Griffith on bass, “Devil Love” is a tour de force mix of gritty rock, catchy pop, and introspective soul searching from an artist hitting his full stride.
2017 figures to be a busy year for Peter Buzzelle and The Academy, with winter and spring dates in the works.

For the past seven years Alexis has been performing his music at many of the premiere venues throughout the greater Portland area developing a sound that is lyrical and unique. His musical style is a blend of folk, alt/country, grunge and pop that is dynamic and honest in its delivery and content. Pastuhov laces the rural landscape and the long winters of his home state of Maine into his songs, addressing themes of isolation, nature, love and human interaction with heartfelt sincerity. His songs tell the stories of the people around him and the environment that defines them. As a lyricist there is an underlying sense of social awareness to his writing style, a kind of perspective from the ""bottom of the barrel"" so to speak that lends its voice to the characters in his songs.
Alexis Pastuhov has independently released two self produced CD’s of original music over the past three years. The first of which, a self titled EP released in the summer of 2008 and the second and most recently completed CD entitled ""All These Secrets Made the Greatest Friends"" was released in the summer / fall of 2010.

Cudi first gained major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi (2008). The mixtape caught the attention of American rapper-producer Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint in late 2008. Cudi has since gone on to launch his own record label imprints, the now-dissolved Dream On and current independent label, Wicked Awesome Records. Initially a rapper, Cudi has since added singer, songwriter, record producer, guitarist, music video director and film composer to his repertoire.

As of 2018, Cudi has released six studio albums as a solo artist. In 2008, his debut single ""Day 'n' Nite"", led him to prominence, reaching the top five of the Billboard charts. Cudi's debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009) was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2010, he released Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, which was preceded by ""Erase Me"" and ""Mr. Rager"". Later that year, Cudi formed a rock band, now known as WZRD, with his long-time collaborator Dot da Genius, releasing one eponymous debut album, in early 2012. The album debuted at number one on the Top Rock Albums chart.[4][5] In April 2013, Cudi released Indicud, which became his highest-charting album on multiple charts. In February 2014, Cudi unexpectedly released his fourth album, Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, exclusively to digital retailers with no promotion. In 2015, Cudi released his rock album Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven to negative reception. In 2016, he returned to hip-hop with his sixth album, Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin' to critical acclaim. Cudi later released a joint album with West under the eponymous name Kids See Ghosts.

Kid Cudi has sold over 5.2 million digital singles and has worked with numerous prominent artists in the music industry, including Jay Z, Mary J. Blige, David Guetta, MGMT, Shakira, Snoop Dogg and Michael Bolton, among others. With his originality and creativity, as well as the emotion he conveys in his music, Cudi has amassed a large cult-like following among high school students, college students and stoners alike. In 2010, Cudi ventured into acting when he began starring in the HBO series How to Make It in America. Cudi has since appeared in several feature films, including Goodbye World, Need for Speed and Entourage. In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as One Tree Hill, The Cleveland Show and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. In 2015, he was the bandleader on the IFC series, Comedy Bang! Bang!.

Their album Robots Helping Robots was produced by the late and much-missed SCOTT MILLER of GAME THEORY and THE LOUD FAMILY fame.

After a break, Paula re-emerged with her first solo album, Aquacade, in 2001, displaying her wry, left-field lyrical gift in its clearest light. She has subsequently released albums under her own name and with Regular Einstein. The Northern California sessions which yielded “Flying Dream”, “Green-Wood” and one other tune yet to see release are the start of a new project for Carino conceived as a collection tracked in various locations.

From official website: When Canasta throws around the term “long-awaited” to describe their upcoming album, The Fakeout, the Tease and the Breather, they aren’t just whistling Dixie. Considering the band has been a staple—perhaps even the unspoken centerpiece—of Chicago’s orchestral pop contingent this millennium, it’s hard to believe that this is just their second full‐length. But Canasta doesn’t profess to be any sort of lightning rod for the muses. As un‐sexy as it sounds, the members are probably better described as pop craftsmen/women. Their composition process may take time, but it elicits serious pride in the end result.

Boasting a six‐person line‐up, Canasta has always augmented the standard rock set-up with piano, keyboard, violin and trombone. But despite an ever‐changing roster that has included fifteen members (!), founders Matt Priest and Elizabeth Lindau continue to keep the orchestrations meticulous, the lyrics thoughtful, the melodies unforgettable and the sound uniquely “Chicagoan.” But don’t get the impression they spend all their time cooped up in the studio and rehearsal space. Since forming, they’ve managed to live out one rock n’ roll dream after another. They’ve toured the country—hitting CMJ and SXSW—and back at home, headlined the legendary Metro and held the prestigious Schubas residency. They’ve gigged with killer bands like Wilco, Grizzly Bear, Devotchka, Alabama Shakes, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Sloan, Kaiser Chiefs, Menomena, White Rabbits and The Delgados and even played a set for President Obama. Their songs have made their way into TV commercials, a movie trailer and NPR’s programming and they’ve sold out pressings of both their debut EP, Find the Time, and full-length, We Were Set Up…

…which brings us to the new album. It’s a record that earns its lengthy gestation period and demonstrates a big step forward in songwriting. This album’s louder moments are darker, denser and more dramatic than those found on past recordings, with harder‐hitting drums, boomier bass and a swarm of buzzing synths. But conversely, its prettier moments are sparser and more heartbreaking, with vocals bordering on a whisper and the audible creaking and squeaking of piano pedals, guitar frets and violin strings. And along the way, the record flirts with elements new to the band, borrowing from the likes of disco, shoegaze, spaghetti western, gospel and blue‐eyed soul. But in their hands, it never spirals out of control; it’s unquestionably still a pop record at heart. The album, the band’s first for upstart label RWIM Chicago, will be released this Spring. And despite the wait, Canasta’s confident that once folks hear exactly what they’ve been up to, all will be forgiven and 2010 will emerge as THE YEAR OF THE FAKEOUT! (Typing that last part was every bit as fun as I’d hoped it would be.)"

Flip through any of the band members’ stacks of vinyl & you’ll find everything from Italian love songs, to art rock noise pop, to roots reggae, to old school funk, to new school hip hop, to classic easy listening, to savage Viking metal. Not afraid of marrying the force of heavy guitars and striking drums with electronic loops and hooky vocal melodies, the band has been able to meld their wide range of influences into a style of their own.

27 has shared the stage with a variety of notable bands such as Portugal. The Man, Explosions in the Sky, Minus the Bear, Pelican, Earth, the band Isis, and Mastodon. 27 has toured the UK, Japan, Europe, Canada, and the US.

The band has had a number of music placements in indie films, as well as several primetime TV shows including Showtime’s “Shameless”, MTV’s “Awkward”, SyFy’s “The Magicians”, and ABC Family’s “The Lying Game”.

When not busy with 27, Adam can be heard fronting his high voltage power trio Nomad Stones, writing new songs with his seminal rock band Cave In, or on tour with Jacob Bannon’s Wear Your Wounds. Terri played with Boston metal band Phantom Glue, and has released music with Dusty Skull, as well as Vardlokk featuring Grutle Kjellson from the extreme metal band Enslaved.

Influenced by elements of post-punk and dream pop, their sound is characterized by its vocal melodies and atmospheric guitars, mixed with drumbeats and synths. Described by Tom Robinson’s BBC 6 radio program as “gritty, dirty, calm and ethereal at the same time, with beautiful vocals”.

The Anglo-Chilean band was formed in 2007 by Chilean guitarist Lau Stranger and English/Croatian singer Tessie Stranger, initially commuting between Chile and London.

Davidson once led the band Dear Nora, which disbanded in 2008. California Lite was Key Losers’ first official full-length album, though Key Losers did release a 9-song “mini-album” called Adjust on States Rights Records in early 2010. Key Losers was a band that may be characterized by its concept-driven lyrics and melody-driven music. Davidson recruited an all-star band to perform as Key Losers for this album. This band should be referred to as “Key Losers Black Crow Session Band”. Phil Elverum (Mount Eerie) engineered the album in Anacortes, Washington, during late 2010 and early 2011. Elverum’s record label P.W. Elverum and Sun released California Lite as an LP and digital download on May 24th, 2011. Elverum recorded California Lite on an analog tape machine, almost completely live, with only minimal overdubbing. Key Losers Black Crow Session Band will be honored if listeners experience a blend of soft rock, smooth jazz, classic rock, pop, folk, art rock, and noise in this music, and will be flattered by comparisons to a number of acts ranging from Santana to Sade to Joni Mitchell to Stevie Wonder to Julee Cruise to Steely Dan to Steve Reich to Spin Doctors."

To ensure they never outgrow their name, they called themselves Mergence and birthed a unique sound that will only continue to grow, expand and embrace a wide range of musical genres. Influences range from hip-hop and funk to jazz and instrumental, and their diverse backgrounds are seamlessly and intricately melded into the style heard today.

Compared to the likes of The Black Keys, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and Pink Floyd, it is undeniable that Mergence's distinctive trait is the passion and soul infused in the performance of each track.

Mergence's meditative lyrics are as raw as its sound, threading themes of life, love, sex and death. Their tracks evoke a strong reaction from their devout, diverse following, from young to old and from all walks of life.

With an earthy, catchy sound, Mergence is as real as it gets. Their live shows and performances are an unequivocal match to the quality of their tracks and album — because they're recorded live, too — packaged into a lustfully smooth sound, collaboratively and effortlessly produced by the band's diverse members, including vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist Adam Bruce, Yod on guitar, Brandon Shupe on bass and Jason Roedl rounding out the rhythm section on the drums."

Canterbury - a city in the garden of England has a rich history and it's against this backdrop that the band 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' formed in the winter of 2003 and attempted to create music as vast and haunting in sound as the city's cathedral itself.

Alastair Blackwood (vocals), Nick Watts (guitar), Will Hasler (bass) and Graeme Blackwood (drums) originally having grown up in different parts of the UK including a few years in the U.S. met while studying at university and discovered they shared a mutual love of film soundtracks - the source of inspiration for the band name and not - as many people assume - the track by Radiohead. As a result, they decided to form a band with the express purpose of combining the fragility of Thomas Newman, the ethereal beauty of Jon Hopkins & Cocteau Twins with the power, aggression and sonic theatrics of Hans Zimmer, Muse and Arcade Fire.

Having released their debut album 'The Shapes We Fear Are Of Our Own' in March 2010, the band were asked to play a Maida Vale session for BBC Introducing, won the Camden Crawl Emerging Talent DIY award and rounded the year off with a slot at the Reading & Leeds festival. Motion Picture Soundtrack have now returned to the music scene after a lengthy absence having finally completed work on their second album 'Iconoclast' (due for release early 2015)."

From their bio on their website:
In 2009, Crystal City formed as a duo, recording their self-titled acoustic EP just three months after meeting. In the years to follow, the duo grew into a full band. Following their first and second full-length albums Change (2014) and Bartenderly (2017), Crystal City have spent their time touring across the country, and have been met with positive reviews of their blend of rock and acoustic songs. The band has shared the stage with national acts such as Charlie Parr (and Devil's Flying Machine), Lucy Dacus, The Cactus Blossoms, Miles Nielsen, Adia Victoria, The Whigs, The Good Life, HoneyHoney, Matthew Logan Vasquez and The Ike Reilly Assassination.

The songs on Three-Dimensionality are less about literal storytelling than providing impressions of feelings and ideas. This may be what Crystal City means by the title: time to move from being obvious and two-dimensional to working towards a three-dimensionality. This album shows that kind of depth. Three-Dimensionality is out now on vinyl and all streaming platforms."

Helvetia's first record, ""The Clever North Wind"" (2006), was released on The Static Cult Label and distributed by Up Records. Their first national exposure was achieved by touring with Built To Spill. Helvetia is produced/performed by Jason Albertini and sustained by a rotating live line-up, which has included C. Dove Amber, Jim Roth and Scott Plouf. Their third release, ""Headless Machine of the Heart"" (2008) was recorded entirely on a 4-track tape machine. Helvetia continues to release music through The Static Cult Label (which is helmed by Duster-mate Clay Parton). The name Helvetia is the female personification of Switzerland, the childhood home of Jason Albertini.

From another info page:

Helvetia (pronounced “hel-vee-shuh"") is the project of Jason Albertini, a previous member of UP Records band Duster and current bassist of Built To Spill. The band consists of former Duster bandmate Dove Amber, along with Zeke Howard, formerly of Love As Laughter (Glacial Pace, Sub Pop, UP Records), Samantha Stidham, and Jim Roth, also of Built To Spill. Having grown up in Basel, Switzerland, Albertini chose the name ‘Helvetia’ — the female personification of Switzerland — because of its lyrical and poetic sound. Between 2006 and 2011, Helvetia put out seven releases on The Static Cult Label, run by Duster’s Clay Parton, and toured with bands like Built To Spill and Meat Puppets. After running monitors and performing other roadie duties for Built To Spill for years, Albertini officially joined the band in 2012.

Known for recording most of Helvetia’s albums himself on a 4-track (except for 2008’s The Acrobats, recorded at the Seattle-based studio of Built To Spill’s Jim Roth), Albertini’s songs are raw, experimental, and psych-tinged. 2012’s Nothing In Rambling, the band’s first release for Joyful Noise Recordings, featured some of their most focused and inspired tracks to date. Shortly after its release, Albertini started recording new material that was deemed lost after a computer meltdown, but was eventually recovered and released as A Dot Running For the Dust - The Lost Sessions in early 2015. It will be followed by Helvetia’s new album, Dromomania, due out October 2nd on Joyful Noise.

“Dromomania” evokes the simplicity of ‘70s Kinks, combined with a good dose of Captain Beefheart and the randomness of The Residents. Third-wave hardcore influences meld with elements of Neu-like trance rock; Meat Puppets and Elevator to Hell come together on tracks like “Bermuda” and “Radio Shower.” Dromomania is a condition of wandering with no notice of intent nor memory of getting to where you’re going — just when you think you can get comfortable, you’re transported to a different place with a different set of ideals. Dromomania is a vague sense of feeling and dreams a-plenty."

Their music moves between poles of tonality and atonality, utilizing volume, space, silence, folk and psychedelia, and the scrape and hiss of steel on steel. Initially conceived as a recording project, the group has steadily evolved toward music of a more public nature.

Formed in Houston in 1991 (and relocated to Austin in 1997), Charalambides has evolved through various configurations based on the core duo of Tom & Christina Carter. From 1993 to 1996 they performed and recorded with guitarist Jason Bill (currently with Arizona duo Migrantes), and since 2000 the lineup has included steel guitarist Heather Murray (formerly of Ash Castles on the Ghost Coast).

Moving to Australia in the early eighties, Marty joined The Church and then in the early nineties All About Eve, while Dare concentrated on becoming an engineer and producer, working at the renowned Townhouse Studios in London, before founding the VIP Lounge studio in Penzance, Cornwall. In the early noughties Dare and Marty formed Noctorum and in 2003 they released their first album on Heyday Records, Sparks Lane. Before their second album, Marty joined The Saints and in 2006 Heyday released Offer The Light. The album was re-released as a digipak in 2010 on Second Motion Records.

Doug White - founder, guitarist and songwriter from Projekt's now disbanded Tearwave - gathers a new group of fantastic musicians to continue the sonic journey he began just a few years ago. Building on Tearwave's sound and shoegaze elements made popular in the late 80's and early 90's by bands like Lush, Slowdive, and the Cocteau Twins, Makaras Pen adds the twists and turns of an aggressive indie rock band creating an electric, intense and startlingly fresh new perspective on these genres.

Emma's lyrics delve into the darker side of failed relationships, yearning to set oneself free, leaving harmful situations and looking towards a better future. At times the euphoria of a new situation intertwines with anticipation of the failure to come. Emma refrains from a weak, victim's perspective, instead using the process to develop autonomy and independence as she searches for new inspiration in life. With so much more to Emma than a pretty girl with a beautiful voice, she commands the listener's attention, bringing a personal style that pulls the listener along for the ride.

Inspired by post-punk, dreamy pop and a touch of electronica, Film School started in 1998 as a two-piece band. Greg Berten played guitar, keyboards, sang and wrote songs whilst Paige Weber played drums. The pair recorded material together, a lot of which never saw the light of day, whilst the rest they distributing on their own. The collaboration lasted a couple of years until around 2000, when both members chose to go their separate ways.

Greg began to write some new material and with Paige out of the picture he joined forces with a rotating cast of musicians to make 2001's full-length A Brilliant Career. Involved in the sessions were keyboardist Jason Ruck and guitarist/vocalist Nyles Lannon, who both went on to become permanent members of the band and Scott Kannberg from Pavement.

For the tour supporting A Brilliant Career, Film School recruited Lannon's fellow Technicolor bass player Justin LaBo and drummer Ben Montesano. This lineup recorded 2003's Alwaysnever EP for Kannberg's boutique label Amazing Grease. After appearing at South by Southwest early in 2005, Film School signed to Beggars Banquet and began recording, joined by new drummer Donny Newenhouse. The On & On EP arrived that fall and heralded the release of their self-titled album in winter 2006.

Film School's lineup had almost completely changed by the time Hideout, their third album, arrived in 2007; bassist Lorelei Plotczyk, guitarist Dave Dupuis, and drummer James Smith added to the album’s darker, more cohesive sound. 

The group spent most of 2008 touring in support of the album and contributed a cover of ""An American Dream"" to the Love and Rockets tribute album New Tales To Tell the following year.

When Beggars Banquet dissolved and left Film School without a label, the band members planned to release their fourth album, Fission, by themselves. However, Hi-Speed Soul, which issued albums by the group’s former tourmate Adam Franklin, stepped in and gave Fission a mid-2010 release. 

Film School has also provided music for a series of short films by Demetri Martin, known collectively as ""Clearification"", an advertising campaign for Windows Vista."

“Ferris and Caruso have found their respective vocal soulmates, the kind of perfect harmonies that send a gripping shiver down the backbone of the listener” says The Deli Magazine.

No Depression says, “Freddy & Francine currently top my list.  There is definitely a palpable chemistry between these musicians, with their vocals blending like milk and honey.”

There’s this guy named Eric Crugnale.  You can call him Crug-nally, or Cruñale or possibly even Crug-nail, but not Crug-a-nagel.  Anyway, he writes songs.  He can also sing and play the guitar.  He knows how to do other stuff too, but that’s a topic for another bio.  Back in the day, he was in a band named The Rockefellers where he wrote songs, played guitar and sang as those were the things he’d be most likely to do in a band.  They had some fun, made some records, played some shows, exchanged some moving parts and eventually disbanded with Eric deciding to chill out for a few years.  But the lore of the sea beckoned him back, and he eventually decided to build a home studio, and through some other fortuitous events, found himself connected with some great musicians that could tolerate him and help him realize some of his more recent musical inspirations.  This lead to his first solo release, Carol Was Here in late 2010.  The album received rave reviews on the Power Pop circuit making several “best of” lists for the year, earning a respectable amount of radio play, drawing songwriter comparisons to Bacharach, McCartney and Wilson and generating enough sales to pay for the paper this bio is written on.  The digital-only release Under the Cushions followed in 2012.  Eric eventually returned to the studio to work on the follow up album, the latest and greatest Time Kills.  If you don’t blink too frequently, you may catch him around NY performing his own songs, making a guest appearance at a NYRMA event, playing guitar in a friend's band or picking up his dry cleaning on Saturday mornings.

From an impromptu jam, in early January 2009 at Jack White's Third Man studio in Nashville, the foursome found common ground and began writing, composing and laying down recordings 'on the fly'. The outcome was the band ""The Dead Weather "" and the album ""Horehound"", representing one of the brightest and most refreshing events in the musical history of 2009.

Alison 'VV' Mosshart, [ex ""Discount""] and still part of ""The Kills"" duo, provides lead vocals, backing guitar, percussion and her compositional style and delivery to many of the band's lyrics,

Dean Fertita, [ex ""Waxwings"" and ""Queens Of The Stone Age""] brings his multi-instrumentalist skills to bear on guitar, bass, organ, piano, synth and backing vocals.

Jack Lawrence, [ex ""Do-Whaters"" and 'floating' member of ""The Greenhornes"",  ""Blanche"" and ""The Raconteurs""] provides bass, guitar, drums and backing vocals.

Jack White, aka Jack White III, [""The White Stripes"" & ""The Raconteurs""] plays drums, provides lead and backing vocals, and plays his unmistakable style of lead guitar. Born ""John Gillis"", White began work in the upholstery trade, forming his first two-piece band ""Two Part Resin"", later renamed ""The Upholsterers"" after a career he would leave behind. He was then a member of ""Goober & The Peas"", Two-Star Tabernacle"" and ""The Henchmen"" before morphing into the persona of Jack White of ""The White Stripes"". After the success of ""The White Stripes"" as a 2-piece, with his wife Meg on drums [who's surname he adopted], White was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as 17th in their list of ""Greatest Guitarists Of All Time"".

""The Dead Weather"" band debut was a performance at ""Third Man"" HQ in Nashville on the 11th March 2009, followed by the single ""Hang You From The Heavens"" released from the ""Horehound"" album. The album was released on 13th July 2009 in Europe and the following day in North America, with 3 tracks made available as downloads for the ""Rock Band"" video game. The 3 tracks were ""Hang You From The Heavens"", ""No Hassle Night"" and ""Treat Me Like Your Mother"". In October 2009 the band released a further single ""I Cut Like A Buffalo"", accompanied by a cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band song ""A Child Of A Few Hours Is Burning To Death"". The single was also available bundled with 2 live tracks ""Bone House"" & ""Hang You From The Heavens"". During 2009 the band appeared on ""The Culture Show"" & ""Later, With Jools Holland"" on UK TV.

At the close of 2009 the band were close to completion of a follow-up album and will be touring the Pacific in March 2010, taking in Australia, New Zealand & Japan. By mid-January 2010 a documentary DVD will be available worldwide titled ""It Might Get Loud"" featuring the guitarists Jack White [""Fly Farm Blues""], Jimmy Page & The Edge."

Floater grew out of Eugene, Oregon and was quickly signed to a small independent label called Elemental Records. After two quick albums, the band moved to Portland, Oregon where they remain today.

Floater started out as a predominantly metal/hard rock band. Their earlier songs were centered around bass driven mechanics with subtle influences from Primus and hard rock bands. The early albums also had a handful of acoustic songs, too.

By their third album, more emphasis was placed on the guitar sounds of David Amador. Their sound slowly transitioned from chunky primal rhythms to more loose hard rock sound with many musical suggestions from the likes of Pink Floyd, The Doors, and eventually later on bands like The Police, U2, Jane's Addiction, and many more.

The band tours extensively in the Pacific Northwest and occasionally making a tour once a year throughout California, Arizona, Nevada, and sometimes Utah. Their shows are the bread and butter for Floater fans. The shows are rather well-performed with surprise jams, extensions, and covers. The band has a rather devoted fan-base on the West coast that attends a large majority of their shows whenever possible."

Born of a twelve-year labor of heartache and love, Soft Reeds is the brainchild of Ben Grimes (formerly of Astralwerks' The Golden Republic), a Chicago native whose roots grip firmly in the ’77 Berlin sounds of Brian Eno, David Bowie and Iggy Pop, while embracing the ethos and attack of early American and English indie rock. Originally started as Grimes' post-TGR solo project, Soft Reeds became a full band in late 2009. They released the critically acclaimed 'Soft Reeds are Bastards' the following year, appearing on many 'Best of 2010' lists in the process.
The band features a diverse group of players, anchored by the rhythm section of drummer Josh Wiedenfeld, an Austin, TX native who also moonlights as a producer and arranger, and bassist Beckie Trost, a fellow Chicagoan and childhood friend of Grimes. Filling out their sound on guitar, saxophone, keys and whatever else needs playing is Kansas City native John Mitchell. Together, they fashion a wall of sound that resonates behind Grimes’ signature vocals, which are often compared to the likes of Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) and David Bowie, yet manage to stand uniquely apart.
Soft Reeds continue to reap the benefits of Kansas City’s tight-knit music community, while building an impressive national and international reputation following high-profile appearances at SXSW and CMJ, buzzworthy headlining shows in Brooklyn and NYC, and several major television placements. With the help of a great label, The Record Machine, and with a new album in the works for 2012, they continue to forge ahead with their unique indie/art/pop sound, relying on their strength of collaboration, a unique sonic vision, and a shared interest in the roots of art and popular music to find new and beautiful ways to bring you aural delight."

The quartet, formed after a barroom discussion about Krautrock by guitarists David Koslowski and Nick Williams in 2009, quickly garnered rave reviews about their blistering live shows.

On their debut LP, ‘Caress’, Free Electric State wraps listeners in a tense yet comforting embrace. It isn’t a gentle, loving brush across the cheek. It’s a sensually charged touch—the kind brought about by powerful emotion and breathless anticipation.

The album was recorded and mixed during six rainy days by Jerry Kee at Duck Kee Studio #8 (Superchunk, Polvo, Kingsbury Manx) in the quiet town of Mebane, NC.

Often big, often lush, the group’s engrossing sound is generated by guitarists Koslowski and Williams’ wall of blissfully dense guitars, while drummer Tony Stiglitz steadily pounds out heavy, driving rhythms. Singer/bassist Shirlé Hale’s mournful voice adds a somber element to her dark and often impressionistic lyrics of loss, lust and regret.

According to Merriam-Webster, to caress is to “touch or stroke lightly in a loving or endearing manner.” It’s a small gesture — a private, intimate sort of thing, but Free Electric State’s ‘Caress’ resonates inside these emotional recesses while also booming through rock’s vaulted halls. “It’s not just this blissed out, fuzzed out experience,” says Williams. Yeah, it’s more than that. . .

Transcendental rock that mines ore from the veins of 80's post-punk. Flashes of Siouxsie and the Banshees flirt with motorik beats and guitars that alternate between Edge-esque shimmer and shoegaze smear. ~ Jeremy Withers"

It was a beautiful but primarily solo vision. Lavishly illustrated albums emerged quietly, all set in the vicinity of a place called Mousseron, “a sickly village situated somewhere east of the Azores and only slightly north of the Styx” populated by howling wolves, seductive mermaids and a bawdy captain with his crew of beer-swilling pirates and off-kilter animals with disturbingly human characteristics.

Seven albums have now been released and with the most recent two: Black Tulip Wings (2006) and Gatekeeper (2008), Scarlet’s Well has evolved into a band in its own right, with live gigs, collaborative song writing, luscious merchandise, tantrums and uncorroborated suggestions of bizarre fantasies. A sense of band empathy and the benefits of varied influences are evident in both these albums but there is still a thematic consistency.

Although there is a conceptual thread that runs through the albums, the songs still function as pop in the sweetest sense, i.e. they are catchy, you can sing along (if you must) and most are dance friendly. What makes them special is their unpredictability and the dizzying range of musical genres combined with an essence that is simply ‘Scarlet’s Well’. It’s Whirling Dervish meets gypsy troubadour with the crack of a whip on the rump of a unicorn…then it gets fey and funky.

Lyrics leap from cryptic literary allusions to pert whimsy and although there is a certain obscure quality there is also an air of familiarity: a morphic memory thing bringing on a parallel universe that reveals itself to those who are open to getting lost with new acquaintances down strange cobbled streets, wooded glades, uncharted waters or the dark tunnels of the underworld.
	
Bid describes it better in November Night from Gatekeeper:

Strange songs playing, so darkly chanted
With words that I feel but don’t understand

While Peter Momtchiloff emphasises the benefits of collaboration with New Friends:

We are your new friends, if the night ever ends
It will feel as if we’ve always been here

This is a big band – eight members in all – but the sound, although rich and multi-layered, is surprisingly light and charming. Each new album leaves you with the desire for just a little bit more. It’s a light lunch thing – although there have been songs about “sausages standing to attention”, “Belladonna cooking in her frilly bloomers” and “liver like it used to be”, you are never left bloated.

The Monochrome Set were a more manly outfit – all black and white with staccato beats and a cowboy swagger. With Scarlet’s Well, Bid has gone technicolour and connected with his feminine side aptly complemented by the virgin/vixen vocals of Alice Healey. The rest of the impressive line-up consists of Deb van der Geugten: bass, Sian Chaffer: keyboards, Jennifer Dennito: drums, Helena Johansson: violin & mandolin, Peter Momtchiloff: lead guitar and Martin White: accordion.

Scarlet’s Well is a band of eccentrics for eccentrics, dandies, grannies, choir boys, mariners, twee poppers and indefatigable travellers. The music should ideally be experienced under a flickering light with a glass of fine mead in the company of fey maidens and prattling moles...alternatively, go and see them live…you will come out with naughty little fairies nibbling at the musical bits of your brain!

L.A.-based Idaho Falls is named after group leader Raymond Richards' hometown, but their musical oeuvre sounds somewhat Southwestern in origin (from Arizona or New Mexico, perhaps). Richards -- former pedal steel guitarist with Mojave 3 and co-founder of the Sid Hillman Quartet -- plays guitar in this group and shares vocals with the lovely Heather Goldberg, who contributes mandolin on some of their songs. Guitarist Kevin Feyen is a former member of the Black Eyed Peas, while pedal steel guitarist Greg Vincent appeared on the first two albums by Cake. Original upright bass player Jim Brown left the band in spring 2002; his replacement, Dave Koenig, comes from the lineup of several L.A. bands, including the 2002 lineup of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and a California country-rock outfit, the Quarter After. Another local L.A. player, Roger Brogan, (ex-Sunstorm), is the group's drummer. The Idaho Falls' self-titled 2002 debut was a self-released effort.

New York based, power-pop singer/songwriter and record producer.
In 2006, Matthew Pop released his debut LP, The Great Demise. Despite the defeatist title, Pop has been a strong and prevalent force in the NYC rock scene ever since. Combining high energy power-pop with emotionally charged lyrics, Pop’s unique sound and voice has garnered him a devoted, close-knit group of fans, despite his indie status. His near constant output from his debut up until his last full record, Avalanche, has shown Pop to be one of the most resourceful and hardworking independent musicians in New York. His break-out song, “Lights Out”, was featured on the hit UK show, “Skins” (Season 2, episode 6) and provided him the opportunity to bring his music over the pond in May of 2014, for an international tour. Now, in 2015, with five albums under his belt, Pop seeks to return to the music scene with his sixth album, which will be another studio affair, akin to The Great Demise and his fourth album, Reinventing the Cosmos. ￼Between album releases, Pop has managed his label, Drink More Records, and started an indie rock podcast called “Nothing’s Going To Happen”.

His warm, textural synth pop and distant, dreamy vocals recall acts like Four Tet and Washed Out, though Maramag's roots are actually in metal and hardcore. Originally hailing from Hawaii, he relocated to Northern California and began his career as the drummer for Bay Area hardcore band Murder Practice. He left the band in 2009 to attend the University of California in Santa Cruz where he took an interest in electronic music and became enamored with artists like Aphex Twin and Modeselektor. While away at school he began recording under the alias Bye Bye Blackbird, eventually tweaking the name to Blackbird Blackbird after encountering another band with the same name. He released various singles before issuing his debut album, Summer Heart, in mid-2010. His blissed-out, sunny dream pop was well-received and he signed with San Francisco indie Lavish Habits to release his follow-up EP, 2012's Boracay Planet. Tours of the U.S. and Europe followed as he continued to evolve his live set-up and in 2013, it was announced he had signed to prominent San Francisco electronic label Om Records who released his second LP, Tangerine Sky, in June 2014. ~ Timothy Monger "

These people are involved in a number of ways, some are dancers, choral singers, horns, orchestral instruments, visual artists (electro and organic). Each performance takes on a life of its own keeping its form nonetheless because the core group remains stable. There is a good deal of improvisation but also well orchestrated planned ideas and great songs of newness.

DORKESTRA
Sometimes dufus will play with a number of orchestral instruments including violin, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, saxophone, tuba, piano, flute, oboe, bassoon, percussion, etc.

DOOFAMILY
The Doofamily is made up of previous members of the band and others who are at times invited to be a part of the shows.

Other members have included Daniel Tjäder, Lisa Carlberg and Per Blomgren.
Duncanson and Carlberg went on a hiatus after their 2010 album, due to legal clashes with their longtime label [l=Labrador] and returned in 2016 with a new album Duncanson described as “We started off making a traditional guitar album in 2011 but decided it was too good for our label.

94612,235005,2178695,US,The Album Leaf,A Chorus Of Storytellers,2010,50.05,11,['Album'],"['Electronic', 'Rock', 'Folk, World, & Country']","['IDM', 'Indie Rock', 'Folk', 'Ambient']","THE ALBUM LEAF has been making its mark as a soft-spoken innovator steadily and surely since 1999. One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

As the origin story goes, after going deaf in his right ear, DeRosa began recording audio experiments as a way to interpret sound as he now experienced it. These early audio endeavors, recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder, developed into what would become the first Aarktica album “No Solace In Sleep” (Silber Records, 1999). 

It was also around this time that DeRosa began studying with minimalist pioneer La Monte Young. These studies would greatly influence all of DeRosa’s music in the years to follow. 

Aarktica’s sonically diverse audio explorations span decades, straddling the lines of shoegaze and ambient, jazz and drone, electro-pop and post-rock. Aarktica's 2022 album ""We Will Find The Light"" is now out on Darla Records. Their latest ""Paeans"" is available now on Projekt Records.

Her mission in life is to spread healing through art, and to remind you to love yourself with the fierceness of a kitten that doesn’t know it is tiny. Her music has been featured in film and TV shows, received radio airplay around the world, and led her to perform at the Obama White House in 2016.

Her most recent album Shadow Work is about shining a light in the darkness and healing wounds. The production is big and dark, and performed largely by just two people – Rorie herself, and her father/production partner, Kevin Kelly. “It was exciting to us to see just how much power we could pack into these songs as two humans in a studio with a vision,” says Rorie. The songwriting looks deeply into topics like self worth, growth and letting go, and how our culture treats people who don’t fit the mainstream “default.” The opening song, “Full Moon Charm Bracelet,” was featured in the 2021 film Hearts and Vines, which won a Telly Award for Use of Music. 

A powerhouse performer, Rorie gigs frequently, lighting up stages with her fiery vocals and her sense of humor. She also livestreams regularly on Twitch (twitch.tv/roriekelly), and performs exclusive all-request online concerts once a month for her patrons on Patreon (patreon.com/roriekelly).
