At the time of recording their 1979 debut, the band lineup was Bill Wallace, Larry Pink, Marc La France, and Hermann Fruhm. The appropriately titled lead-off ""Running Start"" was released as a 7"" single and would turn out to be their biggest hit, earning a number one in Guatemala. Crowcuss toured extensively, opening for Burton Cummings, Prism, Goddo, Doucette, and Streetheart, but couldn’t crack the radio charts. Crowcuss recorded and released the follow-up Starting To Show in 1980 in Winnipeg, this time including guitar player Bob Deutscher. With little traction off the second album, the group soon disbanded and went on to other projects. 

The most notable of these is Marc La France, heard on both Crowcuss albums playing drums with alternating lead and backing vocals, who went on to record with superstars like Carly Simon, David Lee Roth, Cher, Mötley Crüe, Bachman & Turner, Loverboy, Glass Tiger, Scorpions, and Alice Cooper.

The band has released 21 albums and had a Top 10 hit in the UK with Couldn't Get It Right. That song and I Love You were also hits in the United States ; Couldn't Get It Right reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977, and ""I Love You"" peaked at No. 12 in 1981

In 1985, Cooper and Glover recruited guitarist Lester Hunt, drummer Roy Adams, and original member Derek Holt to record the Climax Blues Band album Drastic Steps, and this line-up toured in support of the album in the UK, Europe and America. The new line-up soon became established with Cooper, Glover, Hunt, Adams and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s, releasing the live album Blues From The Attic in 1993 and Big Blues in 2004.

Cooper died of cancer, aged 69, in July 2008. He is survived by his wife and two children. He wanted the band to continue, as the other musicians had all been long serving (Glover since 1980, Adams and Hunt since 1985, and Simpson since 1991). Cooper was replaced by singer and saxophone and harmonica player Johnny Pugh, who retired in 2012, and was replaced in turn by vocalist Graham Dee and saxophone player Chris Aldridge.

Born November 9,1946 in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, USA.
Died June 29, 2020, Menifee, Riverside County, California, USA
Burried Onondaga County Veterans Memorial Cemetery
Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York, USA

Born Ruben Armand Mardones, he was raised in Maryland and during his youth, his interest in music was sparked when he saw Elvis Presley perform on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Following service with the United States Navy during the Vietnam War, he landed a job as a staff songwriter with CBS Publishing where he was partnered with Alan Miles. The two penned the single ""Too Heavy to Carry"" for Brenda Lee which appeared on her 1970 album ""Memphis Portrait."" During the 1970s, he formed the band ""Justice"" and launched his solo career with his debut album ""Thank God for Girls"" (1978). His follow up album ""Never Run, Never Hide"" (1980) contained the single ""Into the Night"" which reached number 11 on the American Pop Chart.

Touted by Variety as ""hyperkinetic"" and always on the make, Benny Mardones was nicknamed ""The Voice"" due to his near four-octave vocal range and soulful, passionate delivery. Mardones’ favorite song to perform was his hit “Into The Night,” the song he co-wrote which remains one of the top 25 most played singles in the history of radio, gracing the airwaves over 10,000,000 times. It is also one of the only songs to have ever charted three separate versions of the song as a single by the same artist.

Mardones, enjoyed an extremely successful twenty-five years as a songwriter and showman. He shared the stage with Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones, and played alongside legends such as the Otis Redding band. In a Showtime tribute to rock icon Roy Orbison, Benny performed with the likes of Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, and Johnny Cash. Mardones' ability to compose music that transcended generational gaps and typical pop-rock-r&b genre pigeonholes had much to do with his achingly honest lyrics and soulful delivery. As Rolling Stone quipped, his ""gloriously adolescent romanticism"" appeals to all regardless of age or musical background.

Pursuing a rigorous touring schedule over the years, despite his diagnosis with Parkinson's, Benny gathered his strength from his passion for performing and his adoring fans. He noted that, ""There are days where I wonder if I am going to be able to use these vocal chords...if my legs are going to hold me up. But at this point in my life, my fans are almost family -- they support me and they help keep me going. As long as they want to hear me sing, as long as they want to come to the shows, I will pour every last drop of myself into performing.""

Benny’s first album of all original music since 1999 was entitled, “Let's Hear it For Love” — a torrent of fiery arena rock splashed tunes with catchy hooks and melodic twists, produced and co-written by Warrior Records’ president, Jim Ervin. The release was dedicated to Mardones’ long-time road manager and dear friend, Tommy Piraino, who passed away during the recording from leukemia.

The song, ""Just for you my friend,"" which features a short appearance from Tommy's son, was penned as Benny grieved. ”There are a number of extremely personal tracks on the album that I almost considered not including,” said Mardones. “But, I realized that one of the reasons my friends and fans have been so supportive of me over the years, is that I refuse to hold back. You come to my shows or listen to my albums you get 100% uncensored me.""

Benny died peacefully at his home in Menifee, CA on June 29, 2020 with his loving wife at his side. He passed away from complications of Parkinson’s disease. He leaves behind his only son who now has a child of his own. "

508629,126587,645222,US,Outlaws,Ghost Riders,1980,39.65,8,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Country Rock', 'Southern Rock']","Outlaws are a southern rock band formed in Tampa, Florida in late 1967 by guitarist/vocalist Hughie Thomasson, drummer David Dix, bassist Phil Humberg, guitarists Hobie O'Brien and Frank Guidry, plus singer [a=Herbert Pino].

Guidry brought the name Outlaws with him when he joined(he'd been in another group that had that name). Previous to Guidry's arrival the band had been called The Rogues, then The Four Letter Words. By early 1968 O'Brien & Humberg both had left the band to get married and Frank O'Keefe came in on bass. In the spring of 1968 the group's first manager, Paul D., brought them to Epic Studios in NYC to record an album which was never released after the band and the producer of the album had a falling out. Guidry left at this point after differences with the manager. The group headed back to Tampa, then got another deal to go to Criteria Studios in Miami to record another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released and Gernhard vanished soon after. Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time to play bass while O'Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O'Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herb Pino began playing guitar as well as singing by this time. Drummer Monte Yoho came in that same year to sub for Dix.

In early 1970, the Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul D. (Ped-Dyn. Productions.) The Dave Graham Group's Union leader was Monte Yoho but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O'Keefe, Dave Dix, Billy Jones and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They recorded a cover of the Doors ""Five to One"" as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This grouping disbanded in the Spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Paul D. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so not sure if they would continue.

In 1971 Henry Paul, a singer & guitarist who was born in New York but grew up in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in Greenwich Village NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O'Keefe. In 1972 Hughie Thomasson, himself returned from a brief spell in New York where he'd been backing up folksinger Milton Carroll, joined up with Paul, Yoho and O'Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws

Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971 & 1972, returned from a stint in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band's first infamous guitar trio later dubbed ""The Florida Guitar Army"". O'Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973-74. Buzzy Meekins and another bassist named Rick stood in until he was able to return. In 1974 Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for The Outlaws. Alan Walden(brother of Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden) was told of the group by Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager.

The band was the first act signed to Arista Records under Clive Davis. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd in Columbia, South Carolina. At the end of Lynyrd Skynyrd's set, lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant said from the stage: “If you don’t sign the Outlaws, you’re the dumbest music person I’ve ever met—and I know you’re not.” 

The Outlaws' earliest well known songs were ""There Goes Another Love Song"" and ""Green Grass and High Tides"", both from their 1975 self-titled debut album. Their 1981 cover of ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky"" from the album Ghost Riders was their biggest single chart success, reaching #31 on the Billboard ""Pop Singles"" chart.

But the striking thing about this band is not so much the warrior beliefs, but their sincerity and genuine faith in themselves and their culture.

Nik Winterhawk Alexander, a Cree Indian who lead the band with his savage guitar riffs and powerful vocals, says, ""Music is a very sacred part of Native American lifestyles. If a person of a tribe possesses a rattle or a drum or a stick to beat the drum, those articles are treated with great respect. Winterhawk carried that same reverence toward music, because the ability to play music is a gift""

""It's important for people to realize that the band Winterhawk were not posers"" Alexander emphasizes. ""The majority of our songs have a very deep message in them. We carry high the values our forefathers did: keeping our environment clean, taking care of the creatures, including ourselves. I don't drink. The idea is to be a positive force in front of the young people, he explains.

The members and their close friends all took different jobs in order to further their goals. Some took photos, created artwork, did layout, produced the recordings, etc. Artifix Records is proud to be the label that will unleash all of their recordings in the near future.
Pictured above is the original 7"" EP line-up: Mike, Dash, Rob, and Al
The Reactors lasted through several line-ups. The first Reactors before the 7"" EP were Mike Rodriguez, bass; Al Zenno, guitar; Brad Uhl, drums; and Elizabeth ""Dash"" Frost, vocals. For the 7"" EP, the lineup changed when drummer Brad left the band and was replaced by ""Throbbin"" Rob Vasquez. In early 1980, Al Zenno left the group. The remaining members recruited guitarist Tony Brammel, who was in the Sins and later helped form soul-rock alternative band, The BellRays. The last edition of the Reactors consisted of a three piece: Dash, Mike, and any drummer they could find.

Above is the LP line-up: Mike, Dash, drummer, and Tony
	
The Reactors shared bills with many great bands of the time including; X, Fear, Plimsouls (at a prison show), Simpletones, Crowd, Alleycats, Smog Marines, and more.

Recently, their records have garnered much attention from the ranks of ""Killed By Death"" punk collectors. Their 7"" was released in a rare pressing of 300 copies with two known cover variations. Their LP is almost as scarce.

Artifix Records has acquired all of their tapes and is in the process of sorting out their material for release. Watch for a CD some time in early 2009.

Player was formed in 1977 by Englishman Peter Beckett, who came to the United States after the demise of his popular English band Paladin, along with J.C. Crowley. He was soon joined by Ronn Moss and John Friesen. After many rehearsals and songwriting sessions, Player was born.

In January 1978, Player had an international number one hit with their first single: ""Baby Come Back"", which was co-written and sung by Beckett. The self-titled album went platinum and the band toured extensively. These classic outings included Boz Scagg's Down Two Then Left Tour, Eric Clapton’s Slowhand Tour, Heart's Dog & Butterfly Tour and Kenny Loggin's Nightwatch Tour, playing always to sold out arena audiences. Four albums followed rendering four more top forty singles, including ""This Time I'm In It For Love"", which reached number ten on Billboard's chart.

Peter Beckett has written hit songs for many artists including: Heart, Olivia Newton-John, Kenny Rodgers, The Temptations, Poco, Janet Jackson, The Commodores, Cliff Richards, Survivor, Grace Slick, and more recently Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" fame.

Between the years 1989-1997, Peter was a featured member of The Little River Band and has written several singles for them.

Peter has also garnered many movie credits as artist, producer and/or writer.  These include: The Karate Kid, Two of a Kind, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Major League, St Elmo's Fire (Grammy Nomination), Frankie and Johnny, Rock Star, Terminator 3, Basic, Beyond Borders, Life or Something Like It, Dirty Dancing 2 and Transformers to name a few.

In the mid eighties, bassist Ronn Moss took on another career as Ridge Forrester, the male lead in the daytime CBS TV drama ""The Bold And The Beautiful"", a role he played for 25 years. He has also made many feature movies.

Player started performing again in the year 2003, always featuring an all star line-up, which has included at various times members of The Cars, REO SpeedWagon, Foreigner and Little River Band. Peter and Ronn were part of Sail Rock 2013 and toured the US with Christopher Cross, Orleans, Firefall and many other great musicians.

With that name the band certainly became a part of a special musical family. The founding members of the band, brothers, Dennis and Russell Gulley, along with friend, Tommy Patterson, migrated from Fort Payne, Alabama to the Shoals after several years of working on the road with both regional and national acts, such as Cross from Birmingham and Ruby Winters (Polydor Records recording artist). The Gulley brothers came out of a background of Southern Gospel music, while Patterson was a music student in college. All were searching for a future in music as artists and /or songwriters. Shortly after getting to Muscle Shoals Sound, the trio was joined by guitarist Britt Meacham, and drummer, Ronnie Vance, a native of Florence, Alabama. Britt was a native of Memphis, but had settled in Mobile, Alabama with his new wife, Cheryl. Britt had previously worked with Bell Records recording act, Storm, a rock trio produced by Barry Beckett at MSS (Muscle Shoals Sound). Mike O'rear, the publishing administrator for MSS, was put in charge of demoing the new arrivals for the publishing company and became instrumental in supporting the band members by getting them a house band gig across the Ala.Tenn. state line at a club called Johnny's Club. The band worked there from 1973 till about 1977, when they released their first LP on the Muscle Shoals Sound label, simply titled , ""Jackson Highway"". With the release of their first recording, Jackson Highway began a hard journey that kept them constantly touring throughout the South , colleges, clubs, concert dates, where ever anyone would listen to them. In 1980, their hard work finally paid off with a second LP, produced by the same MSS team of Jimmy Johnson and David Hood. This time the LP was on the MSS/Capitol label. To support the record, the band toured with Ted Nugent, UFO, Triumph, and opened for groups, such as Blackfoot. When Capitol, did not pick up the band's option, the group then moved to Nashville, at the suggestion of hometown friends, the Country Supergroup, ALABAMA. This time, keyboardist, Tommy Patterson chose to stay in Muscle Shoals to do sessions and work for the recording studios. In 1986, after some 13 years together, the band officially disbanded. Since then, the various members have remained in touch, even performing with each other on occasion, and each continues to maintain a musical career. Dennis, lives in Nashville, manages a recording studio with partner, Johnny Neel, formerly of The Allman Brothers and Gov't Mule, and performs at Nashville clubs. He's also toured with ALABAMA and The Moffits. Tommy Patterson is still in Muscle Shoals, works at the recording studios in computer programming, piano tuning, and sessions, gigs locally as well as on the road, with such stars as the legendary, Little Richard. Britt Meacham, lives in Mobile and tours/records regularly with Malaco/Waldoxy Records group, The Beat Daddys. Britt has also toured overseas with Blues Legend, Little Milton. Of course Britt is also famous for supplying some famous guitar licks on the giant rock and roll recording by Bob Seger, Old Time Rock and Roll. Russell Gulley continues to perform and record. He,also is involved with the arts community as a folklorist and community arts administrator. He serves on the board of the Alabama Folklife Association, is active in arts in education programming, and has served his hometown of Fort Payne, as one of the organizers of an annual festival, The Boom Days Heritage Celebration. Ronnie Vance, still resides in Florence, where he is a successful businessman and entrepreneur."

The Zantees (named after an episode of the science fiction television show The Outer Limits) drew on the raw rock ‘n’ roll styles of the 50s, particularly rockabilly music, emphasizing its primitive qualities rather than trying to update the sound. The original quartet comprised Billy Miller (vocals), Billy Statile (guitar), Paul Statile (guitar) and Jimmy Devito (drums). Devito was replaced after only one performance by Miriam Linna, ex-Cramps drummer, who remained throughout the band’s history. Although they originally had no bass player, four musicians eventually occupied that position: Chuck Forssi (whose brother Ken had been in the 60s band Love), Rob Norris (the last bass player of the Velvet Underground and later a founder member of the Bongos), James Stephanik and Mike Lewis (formerly of DMZ and the Lyres). The Zantees’ first record was ‘Francene’, a flexi-disc single released in conjunction with the US record collector magazine Goldmine, in 1979. Other singles followed, as did Out For Kicks, on the Bomp Records label in 1980, and Rhythm Bound, released on the US Midnight label in 1983. They also released a self-titled EP on Midnight in 1983. The Zantees toured the USA, as well as Scandinavian countries in the early 80s, and disbanded in December 1983. Miller, Linna and Lewis subsequently started the A-Bones, a band of similar qualities, in 1984. Miller and Linna also launched the popular independent record label Norton Records, and published their own fanzine, Kicks.

Raised on Long Island. Excellent songwriter…

David Pomeranz is a singer/songwriter who, besides releasing his own albums throughout the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, and beyond, penned the hits “Tryin’ to Get the Feeling Again” and “The Old Songs” for Barry Manilow. Pomeranz has also written extensively for film, theater, and television, and a sample of his song “Greyhound Mary” appeared on hip-hop star Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott’s Miss E… So Addictive album in 2001.

Pomeranz was raised on Long Island, NY. He found early inspiration in Broadway and rock & roll, and first performed before large crowds doing duets with his father at synagogue. As a youth, he picked up piano, guitar, and drums, and by the time he was a teenager, was writing his first songs. While still a teen, he was lead singer for East Orange Express, the members of which would go on to form soft country-rockers Pure Prairie League. Pomeranz signed a contract with MCA/Decca Records at 19, releasing the albums New Blues and Time To Fly, the latter of which featured jazz great Chick Corea. He also toured as an opener for artists such as Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, and Three Dog Night. He continued to record in the late ’70s and early ’80s, releasing the albums It’s in Every One of Us and The Truth of Us. In the late ’80s, David Pomeranz collaborated with Russian rock star Alexander Malinin.

During the ’90s, Pomeranz continued to tour and to compose songs for film, television, and theater. The album Born for You, released in Southeast Asia in 1999, experienced uncanny success in the Philippines, where it became the best-selling album of all time. Besides his number-one hits for Manilow, Pomeranz’s songs have been recorded by numerous artists, including Bette Midler, Kenny Rogers, Kenny Loggins, Richie Sambora, the Hollies, Lou Rawls, John Denver, Donna Summer, Glen Campbell, Kathie Lee Gifford, and U.K. star Cliff Richard (to name just a few).

The ""Daredevils"" name has much to do with the long hair and beards sported by the band in the 1970s, a rejection of the more conservative style of their native South during that decade. They are still around today with a cult like following.

The influences came from emerging new wave bands like Talking Heads, XTC, Wire and Scritti Politti - especially with Talking Heads, with which the band was often compared. With its short and quirky songs, the debut album You Just Can't Sleep (1978) was well received, and the band attracted interest from record labels, and abroad. The LP Party was recorded on a larger budget, and distributed by Passport / WEA. There was a new drummer (Peter Meuris), and they work at Music Farm Studio in Baambrugge, under the direction of producer Don Willard (Beach Boys. Ron Wood, Steve Marriott). The album received good reviews in the country and abroad in 1980.

For the next album - and the last one - producer John Leckie (XTC, Magazine, Simple Minds) was cast. The group gained identity, ceasing to be ""the Dutch Talking Heads"". On this record they received participations from Henk Hofstede and Michiel Peters (Nits), Dennis Duchhart (Minny Pops - who would continue to perform with the band, replacing keyboardist Huba de Graaff), and from the pop and jazz singer Mathilde Santing (all artists who achieved recognition abroad). But The Tapes did not receive financial support to pursue an international career (although the record was released in the USA), and decided to stop. For the re-release of Party, the album was remixed, and received an additional CD containing nine bonus tracks recorded live in 1980."

Fred Knobloch has been performing since the age of 13 when he and some friends formed a band to play at school “sock hops.” In 1973, J. Fred left school to play music full-time; he began performing solo at night clubs across the South and landed a few dates as a session guitarist at MALACO Studios in Jackson. While working for such R&B notables as Dorothy Moore, Eddie Floyd, and Anita Ward, he met drummer James Stroud and pianist Carson Whitsett; it was Whitsett who encouraged his writing and performing, and in 1980, it all paid off with “Why Not Me.” Co-written with Whitsett and produced by James Stroud, J. Fred reached No. 1 on the Billboard AC chart and No. 18 on Hot 100.

On the heels of that success, J. Fred moved to Los Angeles and over the next two years had two Top 10 country singles with “Killin’ Time,” a duet with Susan Anton, and a remake of the Chuck Berry classic, “Memphis.”

Since moving to Nashville in January 1983, Music Row has allowed him to make lots of “noise with the boys” as an artist, session musician, and songwriter. With his good friends Thom Schuyler and Craig Bickhardt, who formed the group SKB, he recorded two albums for MTM including the hits “No Easy Horses” and yet another No. 1 country record with “Baby’s Got A New Baby,” co-written by J. Fred with fellow Mississippian Dan Tyler.

His list of cuts include artists such as Faith Hill, George Strait, Delbert McClinton, Etta James, Ray Charles, The Wilkinsons, Lorrie Morgan, John Anderson, Trisha Yearwood, Larry Stewart, Neal McCoy, Confederate Railroad, Sawyer Brown, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Kenny Rogers. J. Fred also has composed for TV and movies with songs heard on Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 90210, as well as the feature films “Next of Kin” and “In Country.”"

Most notably, Stormer had musicians from the San Gabriel Valley who went on to become successful.

Stormer was one of the many popular acts that contributed to the music scene of the Sunset Strip, sharing the stage with [a2079499], and [a1719529], as well as opening up for [a94066] at the Pasadena Civic and the Golden West.

On November 19, 1976, Stormer played a sold-out show with [a94066] and Smile at the Pasadena Civic to a crowd of 3,500. At this concert, [a564433] was in attendance, who later became Van Halen's manager.

In 2008, when asked if the demos will be remastered and made public, Gaines replied, ""I doubt if anyone can find the Masters. We are talking of having a Stormer reunion in the near future. We may decide to record it.""

[a465213] occasionally collaborated with [a372578] and [a13792420] when he was not working with [a274070].

Sussman Lawrence was a band led by Peter Himmelman on lead vocals and guitar, with his cousin Jeff Victor on keyboards and backup vocals. Both had previously performed as the only white members in Minneapolis soul singer Alexander O'Neal's band. Saxophonist Eric Moen, bass guitarist Al Wolovitch, and drummer Andrew Kamman rounded out the group, which formed in the late ‘70s and took its name from a character on Steamroller, a local public-access television comedy show that Himmelman hosted.
The members of Sussman Lawrence had all gone to junior high school together in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park. Heavily influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley, Himmelman brought a pronounced reggae/ska flavor to their debut album Hail To The Modern Hero! and then embellished it on the more polished and ambitiously pop-oriented follow up, the double LP Pop City. Both albums fueled Sussman Lawrence’s incendiary live shows with such fan favorites as “House on Fire, ” “Baby Let Me Be Your Cigarette, ” “Closer, Closer, ” and “The Fifth of August”—a love song that would resurface on Himmelman’s 1994 album Skin."

The group emerged from the Washington, D.C., folk scene of the late '60s, its roots dating back to the formation of the acoustic duo Fat City, comprised of future husband and wife Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert.
Together the couple wrote a song titled ""I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado,"" which was recorded by John Denver and Mary Travers; with Denver, they also penned the smash ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."" In 1969 Fat City recorded their debut LP, Reincarnation; after 1971's Welcome to Fat City the duo began working as simply Bill & Taffy, regularly opening for Denver on tour. 

On Bill & Taffy's second album, 1974's Aces, the duo enlisted 18-year-old singer and pianist Jon Carroll; the couple was so impressed by Carroll's performance they decided to form a new group, adding the youngster as well as vocalist Margot Chapman to become the Starland Vocal Band. They soon signed to Denver's Windsong label and in 1976 issued their self-titled debut LP, with the lead single ""Afternoon Delight"" quickly reaching the top of the charts on its way to helping earn them five Grammy nominations. (They won two, including Best New Artist.) ""Afternoon Delight"" was so enormously popular that the group even landed its own short-lived CBS variety series, The Starland Vocal Band Show, which featured a then-unknown David Letterman. 

The second Starland Vocal Band album, Rear View Mirror, followed in 1977, but failed to match the success of its predecessor; Late Nite Radio, issued a year later, also fared poorly by comparison, and after scoring one last minor chart entry with the single ""Loving You with My Eyes,"" the group disbanded in the wake of its fourth and final LP, 1980's 4 x 4. The Danoffs divorced in the wake of Starland Vocal Band's demise; Carroll and Chapman, who had also married at the peak of the group's success, later split up as well. All four members of the group later went on to mount solo careers, though never again recapturing the success of ""Afternoon Delight."" ~ Jason Ankeny"

Born: 6 January 1946 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England, UK.

A key figure in the development of London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and—despite his rather brief period of activity—a continuing influence on popular (and unpopular) music onward into the 21st century. Unfortunately, soon after achieving success with [a=Pink Floyd], he began to suffer from mental problems, possibly complicated by drug use, from which he never fully recovered. 

Having become increasingly unpredictable in person and unreliable as a performer, he was pushed out of the band in 1968. He continued with a brief solo career, releasing eclectic albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, before leaving the music industry and spending the rest of his life living in relative seclusion. 

In 1972 he was in the brief super-group ""Stars"" that played a small number of live concerts in Cambridge in February 1972. Its members were Syd Barrett on guitar, Twink on drums, and Jack Monck on bass . 

Barrett had an infamous ""reunion"" with Pink Floyd in 1975, when he showed up at the mixing session for Shine On You Crazy Diamond, ironically a song written in tribute to him. His appearance—overweight and shaven-haired—shocked and saddened his former bandmates.

Barrett died in 2006, following complications with diabetes.

Tuxedomoon was formed in San Francisco in 1977 by two electronic music students at San Francisco City College, [a=Blaine L. Reininger] (keyboards, violin) and [a=Steven Brown] (keyboards, other instruments). Brown's local theater connections supplied equipment and occasional vocalists in [a=Gregory Cruikshank] and [a=Victoria Lowe], plus more frequent contributions from singer and performance artist [a=Winston Tong]. Punk and new wave were opening up the San Francisco music scene at the time, and Tuxedomoon landed an opening slot for Devo in 1978 at around the same time they cut their first single, ""Pinheads on the Move."" Lowe quit the band before their first EP, No Tears, which featured off-and-on members [a=Michael Belfer] (guitar) and [a=Paul Zahl] (drums). Tong and Belfer departed temporarily, and Peter Principle (b. [a=Peter Dachert]) joined as a full-time member. Tuxedomoon signed to the Residents' Ralph Records in 1979, which eventually got them overseas exposure. Feeling that their ideas were more in tune with the European electronic music scene, the band toured Europe after 1980's Half Mute, for which Tong returned with filmmaker and visual artist [a=Bruce Geduldig]. After 1981's Desire, the band relocated in an artist's commune in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Within a year though they were forced to leave and moved to Brussels, to find first shelter in the Plan K. (a live p.a. club). Reininger began to branch out as a solo artist. Tuxedomoon was also hired to score a Maurice Bejart ballet, the results of which were released in 1982 as Divine. Reininger left for a solo career in 1983 and was replaced by [a=Frankie Lievaart] and horn player [a=Luc Van Lieshout]. In between side projects and scoring, the band sought an international deal for their forthcoming LP Holy Wars; it was eventually released in 1985 and became the band's biggest commercial success. Tong left the group for good that year, leaving Brown and Principle the only remaining San Francisco members; multi-instrumentalist Ivan Georgiev was hired to replenish the group's sound for 1986's Ship of Fools album and tour. Scoring work from past projects has been reissued in Belgium. Reininger, Brown, Principle and Lieshout still record together as Tuxedomoon, whilst Reininger, Brown, Principle and Tong have all recorded as solo artists.

Sharp claims that his parents wanted him to be both a concert pianist and a scientist. He gave up piano, first in favor of the clarinet and then the guitar. His interest in science led him to build his own effects boxes for the instrument. He became intrigued with all types of experimental music, from contemporary classical to free jazz and sophisticated rock. Sharp studied anthropology at Cornell University, where he played in a band and took an electronics class with synthesizer inventor [a=Robert Moog]. At Bard College he studied with free jazz pioneer [a=Roswell Rudd] (future Lounge Lizards John and [a=Evan Lurie] were classmates). He went to graduate school in Buffalo, where his academic advisor was [a=Morton Feldman]. He moved permanently to New York City in 1979, where he played gigs at various underground performance spaces, including the notorious ~Mudd Club. In the '80s Sharp became a major figure on the downtown New York experimental music scene, collaborating with many of its most prominent players, including [a=John Zorn], [a=Wayne Horvitz], [a=Bobby Previte], and [a=Butch Morris]. Over the years, Sharp has led his own bands more often than not. His music draws upon the wide range of his influences, from Coltrane to Zappa to Xenakis and beyond.

British composer, improviser and multi-instrumentalist, who has situated himself for more than thirty years in the area where rock music and new music meet. 

Played in R & B groups at school and did solo folk club work from 1967-1969. Began exploratory musical activities with [a292451] early in 1968 which led to the start [a282968].
Between times since then he has been involved with flautist [a147699] in the Ritual Theatre, played guitar in Brecht-Weill productions, taught guitar and ran a jazz workshop at Cambridge tech.

Co-founder of the British underground band ""Henry Cow"" (1968-78), Frith moved to New York in the late seventies and came into contact with many of the musicians with whom he’s since been associated, for example; John Zorn; Ikue Mori; Tom Cora; Zeena Parkins and Bob Ostertag. Fourteen years in New York gave rise to groups like ""Massacre"" (with Bill Laswell and Fred Maher), ""Skeleton Crew"" (with Tom and Zeena), and ""Keep the Dog"", a sextet performing an extensive repertoire of Frith compositions.

In the eighties Frith began writing for dance, film, and theatre. This, in turn, led to his composing for ""Rova Sax Quartet"", ""Ensemble Modern"", ""Asko Ensemble"" and a number of other groups, including his own critically acclaimed ""Guitar Quartet"".

Best known world-wide as an improvisational guitarist, Frith has also performed in a variety of other contexts, playing bass in John Zorn’s ""Naked City"", violin in Lars Hollmer’s ""Looping Home Orchestra"" and guitar on recordings ranging from ""The Residents"" and René Lussier, to Brian Eno and Amy Denio. Frith was also the subject of Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzels’ award-winning documentary film ""Step Across The Border"". 

He became Professor of Composition at Mills College in Oakland, California, near his home with photographer [a498358] and their children, Finn and Lucia.

Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist [a=Peter Gabriel], who left the band August 15, 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer [a=Phil Collins] who assumed lead vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist [a=Steve Hackett], two years later, saw the remaining three members (Phil Collins, keyboardist [a=Tony Banks] and bassist/guitarist [a=Mike Rutherford]) move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1996 Phil Collins left to concentrate on his solo work and other projects, leaving erstwhile bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks to forge ahead with new recruit; [a=Stiltskin] vocalist [a=Ray Wilson]. This line-up lasted for one album only (1997's [i]Calling All Stations[/i]) and Genesis soon found itself on hiatus after the poor performance and critical reaction of the new album.

In 2006 – after years of speculation – Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford reformed Genesis for the successful [i]Turn It On Again[/i] tour. A reunion involving ex-members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett remains much talked-about and unrealised.

Inducted into the [b]Rock & Roll Hall of Fame[/b] in 2010 (performer).

Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.

""Marshall was blind since birth but amazingly could play the heck out of the piano,"" the band noted on social media. ""He always said his talent was simply God-given. He tuned pianos in South Carolina for decades. We are thankful for Mr. Marshall Tucker and the life he lived."""

Corky (who had recently returned from a stint at Boston's Berkley School of Music) suggested over beers that their mutual love of late '40s and early '50s swing music might make an interesting focal point for a new band. Rehearsals began, and on December 31st, 1977, the Skip Castro Band played their first performance.

Skip Castro's unusual blend of boogie, swing, rock'n'roll obscurities, and original tunes in a frenetic live show quickly earned them a reputation up and down the Eastern Seaboard as a band to be reckoned with. For a decade, the boys kept up a grueling pace of 200-300 shows a year, drawing big crowds and opening shows for the likes of The Kinks, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Little Feat, George Thorogood and the Destroyers, Kenny Loggins, The Hooters, Bob Weir and The Beach Boys. All good things come to an end however and, in March of 1988 the band called it quits."
269915,567290,3932236,Canada,The Charlie Daniels Band,Volunteer Jam VI,1980,70.87,12,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']","['Rock', 'Folk, World, & Country']",['Country'],"The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with [a=Charlie Daniels] joined by [a=Barry Barnes] (guitar), [a=Mark Fitzgerald] (bass), [a=Fred Edwards] and [a=Gary Allen] (drums), and [a=Taz DiGregorio] (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

Inez Andrews was an American gospel singer, songwriter and recording artist. Her soaring, wide-ranging voice — from contralto croon to soul-wrenching wail — made her a pillar of gospel music. The Chicago Tribune stated that ""Andrews' throaty contralto made her low notes thunder, while the enormous range of her instrument enabled her to reach stratospheric pitches without falsetto"" and that ""her dramatic delivery made her a charismatic presence in church and on stage. Andrews started singing in the church as a child and performed gospel music on the road in various gospel groups from the 1940s before joining The Caravans in 1957. Fellow member from The Caravans in the 1950s, Shirley Caesar, once dubbed Andrews ""The High Priestess"" for her ability to hit high notes, and, in 2013, stated, ""there never was and never will be another voice like Inez Andrews."" Another early member of the Caravans, Albertina Walker often said, ""nothing ever worked for the Caravans until Inez started whistling"" — hitting the high notes. She sang lead on The Caravans first breakthrough hit, ""Mary Don't You Weep"", and also had hits as a solo artist with crossover recordings such as ""Lord Don't Move The Mountain"". Andrews began her singing career in the 1940s with two groups in Birmingham, Alabama: Carter's Choral Ensemble and the Original Gospel Harmonettes. By the mid-1950s, the Harmonettes were one of the nation's top gospel groups, with Andrews the understudy for the group's lead singer, Dorothy Love Coates. Coates recommended Andrews to the Caravans, and she eventually moved north to Chicago to become widely known as that group's first successful singer, leading them to the high of their popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1962, Andrews left the Caravans to start her own group, Inez Andrews and the Andrewettes. They toured the country performing songs such as ""It's in My Heart"" and her composition ""(Lord I Wonder) What Will Tomorrow Bring?” By 1967 she was touring as a soloist and lead a successful solo career, she later reunited with The Caravans. She was referred to in 2012 by the New York Times as ""the last great female vocalist of gospel's golden age,"" ranking among the likes of other music legends from the ""Golden Era"" of Black Gospel (1945–60) - Mahalia Jackson, Marion Williams, Dorothy Love Coates, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Clara Ward. In 2002 Andrews was inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame. It was announced prior to her death that Andrews would be honoured with the Ambassador Dr. Bobby Jones Legend Award at the 2013 Stellar Awards. The award ended up being presented posthumously."

 Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, and was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".
Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud but clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his effect on the blues genre, on helping to influence the revived production of the guitar, and on many other guitarists.

Like his brother, he was afflicted with albinism - he was legally blind, and had 20/400 eyesight in one eye and 20/600 in the other, but he made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues. He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.
