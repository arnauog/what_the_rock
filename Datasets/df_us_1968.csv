The group was originally formed in December 1956 as The Cavaliers, with the spelling was changed to The Kavaliers in 1957 to avoid legal problems with another group using that name. After some personnel changes in the summer of 1959 the group became The Barons. In the fall of 1959 the lead guitarist wrote an instrumental he called Night Shadows that the bass player thought was the perfect name for the group. Assuming leadership of the band and against everyone’s wishes, he changed their name to The Night Shadows on their business cards and quickly booked several months of gigs to make everyone relent. From the fall of 1959 through 1961 The Night Shadows were primarily a Chicago-style blues band.

In 1962 the group changed to a rhythm & blues show band featuring Little Erv (Barocas) & [a2697624], an Elizabeth Taylor look-alike, as headliners. For the next two years, the group became one of the most popular R&B bands for racially segregated Southern college dances and formals. In 1964 the British Invasion changed the group’s primary direction to rock, with Erv and Judy departing the group. Fourteen year old Little [a2563519] was picked as their replacement to front the group in 1965. [a5971431], a studio engineer and producer [a1555330] had worked with on sessions since 1959, had opened his own recording facility and was seeking artists with original material. This gave the group an opportunity to record both the tunes Little Phil had collaborated on and some others that Janoulis had written. The end result was a label deal with [l36601] and a single “So Much” featured Little Phil as lead singer. The other band members were Jimmy Callaway (guitar), Bobby Newell (organ), Charles Spinks (drums) and Aleck Janoulis (bass). The Vietnam draft complicated the group's plans, though another single “60 Second Swinger” was released on [l435647]. 

Due to contractual obligations the group then recorded for [l651570] Records under the pseudonym [a4864125]. This name later became the title of their 1968 psychedelic album on Spectrum Stereo. Due to internal conflicts the band split up after their last concert on Memorial Day in 1969. "

According to music journalist Bruce Eder, the band name ""Bo Grumpus"" was the invention of Felix Pappalardi's wife Gail Collins, who was an artist and had a drawing that hung on the couple's living room wall that she called ""Bo Grumpus"". The drawing supposedly depicted a strange-looking creature with other equally strange-looking creatures crawling out of a hole in its stomach. Pappalardi was quoted as saying ""it’s a good name that means nothing."" In 1969, the band had to change its name to ""Jolliver Arkansaw"" after a dispute with the band's music publisher, The Richmond Organization, over ownership of the band name triggered by a move from Atco to Bell Records.

Considered one of the hottest rock bands to emerge from the Pacific Northwest.

At the time, [a=John Greek] was considered the leader of the Wailers, having founded the band in 1957 with a few other kids whose parents were stationed at the McCord Air Force base in Tacoma, Washington. One year later in 1960, some tension grew to an ugly head within the band, and [a=John Greek] left the Wailers. Taking his place was [a=Buck Ormsby], a bassist who originally played with [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. Together with [a=Kent Morrill], these two Wailers created [l=Etiquette Records (2)] as a means to release their own material. Their very first record was a 45 single of ""Louis Louie"" by [a=Rockin' Robin Roberts], another member of the Wailers that was initially a member of [a=Little Bill And The Bluenotes]. This particular single, which came out in 1961, was considered the archetypal recording that inspired the [a=Kingsmen], [a=Paul Revere & the Raiders] and hundreds, if not thousands of other rock bands from the Pacific Northwest to perform the iconic song.
[a=John Greek], the man who started the band, was for the most part forgotten by the music industry.

The band name was inspired by the film Born Free (James Hill 1966). Associated with the Bosstown Sound. Line-up:
Bob Margolin (lead guitar)
Dave Codd (bass guitar, vocals) 
Nick Carstoiu (lead singer, rhythm guitar, keyboards)
Lew Lipson (drums)
Mike Spiros (keyboards, trumpet).

The Indigos and the Missing Links performed covers of Top 40 radio hits, but key players sought to move on from both bands in hopes of penning original material. In early 1967, the band began playing at music clubs and fraternities before attracting the interest of Barry Richards, a blues musician who, through his connections with the New York-based Monitor Records, had the Freeborne signed to a recording contract.

The album that resulted was titled Peak Impressions. They recorded 3 of their debut album's songs at ESP studios, and the rest at CBS studios, in New York City. Despite the Freeborne's age range - between ages 17 and 19 - the group featured three capable multi-instrumentalists, who played a wide variety of orchestral instruments including piano, harpsichord, cello, trumpet, flute, and recorder. Coupled with the band's highly psychedelic theme is traces of blues, which Margolin picked-up from watching a Remains concert prior to the Boston act's tour with the Beatles.

The album was released in mid-1967 to moderate success on the East coast. However, Peak Impressions suffered from being associated with the Bosstown Sound, a commercial campaign that advertised groups such as Ultimate Spinach, Beacon Street Union, and Orpheus with the intention of competing with the San Francisco Sound. It began with moderate commercial success. A factor that lead to the album's commercial disappointment was the Freeborne's lack of touring, due to the fact that three members were high school students. The band did open for the Velvet Underground and the Left Banke at a venue called the Boston Tea Party. They also opened for Tim Hardin and Canned Heat at a venue called the Psychedelic Supermarket.

After firing their manager, the group lost their contract with Monitor Records, and the prospect of recording 2 more albums. In late 1968, the Freeborne disbanded though variations of the band continued to perform well into the 1970s. Margolin was the only member of the band to achieve notable success in music after the Freeborne, performing with Muddy Waters in the 1970s."

In short order, keyboardist Dick Guerrette was added, and Winters left, replaced by guitarist Teddy Dewart. Playing mostly covers, along with a few originals, they got plenty of gigs at local school dances. But finding out that there was another band called the Sensations, a name change was in order. Looking through a dictionary, it was Cooper who came up with the Pandas, and it was a group decision to put Teddy Dewart’s name in front of it. Cooper soon left, replaced by drummer Jerry Labrecque. High school gigs turned into college gigs and club dates (the first was the Intermission Lounge in the Combat Zone), and the band traveled throughout New England, improving their stage act by, for instance, hiring a choreographer to teach them some good stage moves. Then they met promotion man Bruce Patch, who would end up being their producer after insisting that they trim down to a quintet by getting rid of Paul Daly. A 1965 visit to Ace Recording Studio in Boston resulted in two original songs: “Once Upon a Time” backed with “Bye Bye (Out the Window).” The record — first on the Coristine label, then rereleased on Musicor — was a local hit on WBZ and WMEX, and the band started getting some dates outside of New England, but it failed to chart nationally. When a couple of follow-up singles didn’t take off, they parted ways with Musicor, eventually recording the 10-song 1968 album Basic Magnetism on Capitol’s subsidiary, Tower Records. By this time, Dewart had left the band to go to college, and was replaced by guitarist Paul Rivers, but Dewart contributed to the album and got a “guest artist” credit. The album went nowhere, and in 1969, Corelle and Rivers left to form the band Doctor Feelgood (not to be confused with the British pub rockers), reuniting with Sensations members Winters and Cooper, releasing one album, 1971’sSomething To Take Up Time. That was the end of the Pandas. But in 2002 a collection of alternate takes and demos, titled Rarities and Forgotten Gems, was released and the band has reunited for the occasional concert in Beverly, with Dewart on guitar."

They then headed west to Hollywood and caught the attention of A&M Records, where they recorded their self-titled debut featuring cameos from The Tijuana Brass and Leigh Ashford keyboardist Newton Garwood.

The band rattled to the middle of the Hot 100 in 1966 with You’re Gonna Miss Me, anchored by Roky Erickson’s unforgettable yelping vocals, Stacy Sutherland’s guitar, and Tommy Hall’s electric jug runs. According to myth, Tommy’s jug was tuned by the amount of marijuana stored in it.

The group pioneered some of the first garage psychedelia on its albums The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators 1966, and the followup Easter Everywhere 1967. 

However, Texas at that time was an extremely conservative area that still hadn’t come to terms with 50’s rock ‘n’ roll. The authorities and the police set out to bust the entire band for pot (and—not surprisingly—succeeded).

Stacy Sutherland was jailed. To avoid a prison term, Roky pleaded insanity—a misguided ploy that landed him in Rusk State Hospital for the criminally insane for 3 years. That turn of events spelled the end of the band, although there was a posthumous 1968 LP, Bull of the Woods. 

Roky Erickson was released from hospital in 1973 and embarked upon a successful solo career that resulted in a CBS album produced by Stu Cook from Creedence Clearwater Revival. During the 1980s he struggled with mental illness and withdrew from public life for many years. However, in the 2000s he has re-emerged with one of his late 70s/early 80s backing bands, The Explosives, playing regular gigs including the Austin City Limits festival in September 2008, as well as Coachella in California, the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden and Montreal World Film festival in Canada."

An unearthly thunk brought eight-year-old Bill O’Malley to the mouth of a garage on White Street in the Hickman Mills area of South K.C. He talked his way into the drum seat for a few songs, and turned out to be more proficient than the group’s drummer. Brothers Terry (11) and Jack (12) Viles handling bass and guitar duties, respectively, and Ray Bahr took second guitar. They paid their dues in the garage for another few years before coining their long, heady name and running through the usual assortment of talent shows, band battles, and sock hops.

In 1968, when O’Malley was just entering Ruskin High School, the half-decade old group had upgraded to gigs at NCO clubs and other military base recreational stages, wearing matching outfits like their British Invasion idols and toting a slickly rehearsed set of covers. The following year, they took their hard-won Uncle Sam proceeds into Damon Studios on 14th Street and cut a full-length LP of their repertoire, running through it quickly under the bewildered eye of engineer Vic Damon. The slapdash results did manage to preserve the energy and enthusiasm of a 21st Century performance. The material style-hopped from Gerry & the Pacemakers to The Animals to Iron Butterfly to, of course, The Beatles, with everything filtered through their punk-anticipating approach. Shortly after the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art cover photo shoot took place, Jerry Lemberger took over Jack Viles’ guitar slot. Another session commenced in 1970, this time at Cavern, and generated only enough material to issue on two sides of a Cave 45, and only enough room, apparently, to list a truncated version of their name, “21st Century Sound.” Tragedy struck in 1971, when O’Malley was a senior in high school. He was hit by a car on the way home from school and spent nearly a month in a coma. The band drifted apart and eventually moved on to families, vocations, and other 20th century concerns."

Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton, and Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s.

Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm into Something Good"" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but they had two number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 with ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" and ""I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am"". These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone (singer) exaggerating his Mancunian accent.

Their US records were released on the MGM label, which often featured their musical performers in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear.

The group appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain in 1967 through 1970. They recorded their final album of the 1960s Rock 'n' Roll Party, and Peter Noone left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a British invasion tour of the US, culminating with a performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special. A later lineup with lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and drummer Barry Whitwam opened for the Monkees on their 80s reunion tours of the US.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

After nearly 60 years of marriage, his wife, Lady Melinda Rose Woodward passed away in April, 2016."

They toured throughout Mexico in the middle of the decade, and around this time they also made numerous appearances in television advertisements. In 1964, they made their first recordings for Discos Peerless, often covering the hits of foreign groups to great success. They became one of the most popular native pop acts in Mexico in the 1960s.

Their biggest success, however, came in the 70s, when they stopped covering foreign songs as they started to record their own songs. ""¿Por qué?"" and ""Cómo sufro"" were number-one hits in Mexico in 1972 and 1974 respectively.

The first musical stage was with ""Robbie"" García as lead vocalist and guitarist, Roberto Vallarino on the first guitar, Alberto Vallarino on the keyboards and ""Yoyo"" García on the drums. Soon ""Pancho"" Burgos joined as first guitar, Roberto Vallarino playing bass, ""Yoyo"" retired.

This initial period, quite unknown to most of our audience, was unquestionably the most difficult given that we were constantly and as amateurs, playing for free most of the time on radio stations, schools and parties, it is a time that is remembered with affection and is because since we started we had the great luck of having a great acceptance by the general public.
In many presentations, because the repertoire we had was composed of only a few songs, we had to repeat them because the audience would not let us go. The first songs we played were ""Tu Seras Mi Baby"", ""Diana"", ""Y La Amo"" among other themes of the time, by that time we were playing our first unpublished instrumental track that was composed by Jorge Salomón to which the title "" When the sun sets. "" We always had the luck and privilege of making the group sound good. The interpretive enthusiasm, the instruments we had and the great sound quality forged an excellent taste that always forced us to do things well.

Towards the year 1966, after persevering, we began to have presentations of greater importance, greater and better coverage by the press and we had to present ourselves already in theaters with foreign artists of great importance. We started on television in the program ""Cocktail Deportivo with Chicken Palacios"" and ""Pepsi A GO-GO, we began to work on the image of the group with diversity of looks and well-designed uniforms thus beginning the second stage of the group, there is a turn to a series of presentations of relevance. Already the group, with a greater musical coupling and maturity by the end of the year 1966, Robbie García told us that he had to change to live in Quito with his family and that he It would bring a singer to replace it, it was integrated as well as first voice Marcos Molina. Pancho Burgos retired from the group and was replaced by Alfredo Salomón on the first guitar, as a stable drummer Ricardo Rivera and Alberto Vallarino joined the keyboards, Roberto Vallarino always as a bassist, so the group is integrated by five interpreters.

It was at this time when an artistic entrepreneur offered us a very attractive contract, but as part of the contract itself, it conditioned a name change, the one we had was very long and did not allow us to make an adequate publicity for the concepts of those days, the new name chosen was ""Los Corvets"", there is no relevant story or anecdote, it was a simple change emerging for purely advertising reasons, we discarded the previous name with pain. Fue in 1967 when Jorge Delgado Guzmán managed our first recording for the record label ""Orión"" of IFESA. We arrived at the studio and the lack of experience made the recording a bit complicated and Doña Josefina made a quick change with musicians who had already recorded a couple of times joining the first guitar Roberto Viera, in the drums she stayed this time for more time Fernando Rodríguez, on the keyboards Hans Palacio, on the second guitar and percussion Alberto Vallarino, on the first voice Marcos Molina and on the bass Roberto Vallarino. This was the period of greatest activity in terms of presentations and recordings. At the end of 1969 there was a new change and Luis ""Pollo"" Silva joined the band, in the first voice Gustavo Lanatta who was replaced in a few weeks by Antonio Elizalde, and 10 months later by Enrique González, on keyboards Hans Palacio, on the first guitar José ""Pichin"" Luzarraga, on the second guitar and percussion Alberto Vallarino, Roberto Vallarino on bass. A few months later, Ernesto ""Tito"" Haensel joined the band as guitarist. 

Disgrace occurred in 1972, the month of February, when Alberto Vallarino and Doña Josefina de Vallarino died in a terrible car accident. There was a recess of a few months and the group continued this time with Enrique González on vocals, Tito Haensel on the first guitar, Hans Palacio on keyboards, Lucho Silva on drums, Guillermo Granizo on percussion and Roberto Vallarino on bass. After a while Hans Palacio was replaced by Venancio Larrea in the keyboards. After a long musical trajectory and changes between former members of the group, what is the group today is constituted, Amado Terán in the first, Lucho Izurieta in the keyboards, Carlos Vera on the first guitar, Alonso Flores on percussion, Javier López on drums and Roberto Vallarino on bass."

The group's Billboard Hot 100 hits were ""Simon Says"", ""May I Take a Giant Step"", ""1, 2, 3, Red Light"", ""Goody Goody Gumdrops"", ""Indian Giver"", ""Special Delivery"", and ""The Train""

The band began as Jeckell and The Hydes in New Jersey in 1966. The original members were Frank Jeckell, Mark Gutkowski, Floyd Marcus, Pat Karwan and Steve Mortkowitz - all from Linden, New Jersey.

During 1967, they were signed to Buddah Records, where they released five LPs under their own name and a variety of singles, as well as appearing on the LP The Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, which sounded like the usual Buddah studio band in spite of its promotion as a ""bubblegum superjam"". Their first hit single, ""Simon Says"", was written by Elliot Chiprut. During the recording process, the band changed the beat and patterned the song after ""Wooly Bully"" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. ""Simon Says"" soon became a success, hitting #4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The track peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart[ and was heard in the 1968 Frederick Wiseman documentary High School.[citation needed]

The band started touring, opening for major acts such as The Beach Boys. They went on to release the hits ""Simon Says"", ""May I Take a Giant Step"", ""1, 2, 3, Red Light"" (U.S. #5), ""Special Delivery"" (U.S. #38), ""Goody, Goody Gumdrops"", and ""Indian Giver"" (U.S. #5).[citation needed]

The original group disbanded in 1970.

In the years of 1979-1980 the band was briefly resurrected through Jolly Joyce Agency out of Philadelphia with members Chuck Allen, Fred Eyer, Tony DiNiso, Cindy Tritz, Mike Schneider and Kevin.[citation needed]

In 1999, original member Frank Jeckell and Mick Mansueto put the act back together.[5] As of 2019, Fruitgum currently performs its own hits, in addition other songs from the 1960's.

There is some misinformation in some sources that Joey Levine was a member of the 1910 Fruitgum Company. This is false information. Joey Levine was never a member of the group and had no involvement in any of its recordings."

Arthur, or Arthur Lee Harper, was as mild-mannered a folk-rock singer/songwriter as there was in the late '60s, singing sad songs that emanated fearful uncertainty, as well as slight airs of self-pity and disengagement.
Arthur is a relatively obscure artist from the US who recorded two albums in the late 1960s and then one more in the mid 1970s. 
Sadly, Arthur Lee Harper died of a heart attack on January 10th, 2002 the same night his wife was killed in a car accident.

Robert John is an American singer-songwriter

John – born Robert John Pedrick – had been recording since he was 12 years old, first charting in 1958 (as ‘Bobby Pedrick’), and then continuing to record through the 60s for a variety of labels.

He recorded ‘Raindrops, Love and Sunshine’ in 1970, featuring his powerful (nearly ear-shattering) falsetto, and an arrangement that owes a huge debt to the previous year’s mega-hit ‘More Today Than Yesterday’ by the Spiral Starecase.

John went on to have a number of hits in the 70s and 80s, including the aforementioned ‘Sad Eyes’ (#1 1979) and even and putting that falsetto to use again in 1983 with a remake of the Newbeats ‘Bread and Butter’ (#68 1983), which came out on Motown.

His debut release was a cover of the [a=Little Richard] hit ""Tutti Frutti"" in December 1955. The song was not a hit, but convinced [l33261] to sign Smith to a solo contract, resulting in three more releases, but still no hits.

In 1961, Smith was recruited by [a=Count Basie] to be his vocalist, a position he held until 1965. 
He also continued to record with different labels, but a hit remained elusive. 
By 1968, Smith's then label, Columbia Records, was ready to release him from his recording contract, when he entered the charts for the first time with ""Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp"", which reached No.2 in the UK Singles Chart and also broke the Top 40 in the United States. 
In 1976 [a=Kenny Rogers] revived the hit as a country song.
Smith changed the first part of his name to O.C. and recorded the [a=Bobby Russell] written song ""Little Green Apples,"" which went to No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won Russell the 1969 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. It received a gold record from the R.I.A.A. for sales of one million records.
He continued to record, reaching the R&B, Adult Contemporary and pop charts in his home country with the likes of ""Daddy's Little Man"", ""Friend, Lover, Woman, Wife"", ""Me and You"" and ""Love To Burn"". He also returned to the UK Singles Chart in 1977 with ""Together"", reaching a Top 30 position.
After CBS, Smith united with [a=Charles Wallert], who wrote and produced the title track as well as the album for ""Dreams Come True"" that returned Smith to the national charts. The Whatcha Gonna Do album, resulted in three nationally charted singles for a total of 40 weeks. This album contained ""Brenda"", ""You're My First, My Last My Everything"" and ""Spark Of Love"". Additional hits ""The Best Out Of Me"" and ""After All Is Said And Done"" established Smith as a Beach Music star. Nominated for six awards at the third Beach Music Awards, Smith captured five.
Smith became pastor and founder of The City Of Angels Church in Los Angeles, California where he practiced for 16 years. One of his last recordings, ""Save The Last Dance For Me"" reached the number one position on the Rhythm n' Beach Top 40 chart.
Shortly after his death, Governor Jim Hodges proclaimed June 21, 2002, 'O.C. Smith Day' in the State of South Carolina. Smith was posthumously elected to the Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame in November 2002.

Initially comprised of six members of a 13-piece group The Men - [a720834], [a171375], Bob Page (quickly replaced by [a1016362]), [a821999], [a1351519] and [a1110099] - each member was a vocalist, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Alexander left in 1967 following their second album, and was replaced by [a821997], before returning in 1968 (as [a1230679]), making the group a septet. 

Following their 1969 self-titled fifth album, Russ Giguere left the band and was replaced by keyboard player [a561475]. This lineup completed two further albums before the 1972 death of Brian Cole ended the group’s stability and any further significant success, with members gradually departing through the 1970s, eventually leaving Ted Bluechel as the sole remaining original member before a reunion of the surviving members in the early 1980s.

Inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in September 2003, they continue to perform to this day, with a lineup featuring original members Jules Alexander and Jim Yester, as well as Del Ramos (brother of Larry Ramos) and Jordan Cole (son of Brian Cole).

Unreleased tracks include renditions of the Marvelettes' Daddy Knows Best, Honey Boy (previously released by both Mary Wells and the Supremes),  Don't Let Me Off The Hook, Sweeter As The Days Go By, Baby I've Got It, and Memories, Keep Haunting Me.

Still a teen, Lisa landed a voice over job on the Fantastic Four series, using the name Leeza Miller she did both the Nova and Frankie Ray voices on the show that ran from 1967 to 1970 and was Wendigo (a monster) in the Hulk. In 1992, now known as Leeza-Miller-McGee, she did the voice of Charley Davidson in the animated lust feature Biker Mice From Mars.

After Motown, Lisa cut Does She Know for Trident Records before affiliating with Canterbury Records (owned by Mattel Toys) and ran by Ken Handler, the real life model for the Ken doll, Barbie's man. Helen and Kay served as the labels' Artist and Repertoire Directors and wrote and produced for Yellow Balloon, Joanie Sommers, Sandy Wynns, Alex Valdez and Little Lisa, now known as Lisa Miller (not to be confused with the Australian pop & country singer). Lisa cut one album, Within Myself, with Helen and Kay writing and producing most of the songs and released a popular yuletide single, a horrific tale entitled The Loneliest Christmas Tree (1967) that still sells during the holiday season ; the A-side Love Is was quite popular as well.

Her next stop was Cyclone Records where she cut Castles In The Sky b/w Broken Home written by the Lewis Sisters and produced by Bob Mercy. In the late 1980s, Ian Levine recorded Lisa as Leeza Miller for his Motorcity Records' project. Two sides resulted: Sign Of A Heartache and Tomorrow Never Comes/ Lisa does recording projects either as lead vocalist (with Glenn Medeiros) or background; the behind scenes work includes sessions with David Weaver, Craig & Company, Michael Sembello, Jai Cie, and Joanie Bartels.

Around 1963 or 1964 'The Thunderbirds' were formed and the band included the great guitarist Albert Lee and keyboardist Dave Greenslade. The band recorded five singles on the UK EMI subsidiary Columbia, but none made any impact on the charts. The singer was generally believed to be black.
Success came only after a move to the Immediate label. The label was started by The Rolling Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham. Accordingly Farlowe got to record a lot of Jagger/Richards compositions and some of his records were produced by Mick Jagger. Out of 11 singles five had covers of the Rolling Stones' songs on them.
The third single released on Immediate label ""Out Of Time"" made it to the top.

Born: 13 march 1939 Antwerp.
Died:   8 august 1982 Antwerp.

Ferre Grignard started of at the art academy as a painter. He had a fear of flying. He is never been in America and also has never lived in the black ghetto. That was a fantasy story to please the journalists. He lived in a mansion, the birthplace of Peter Benoît, where he made music, painted and partied with the 20 friends who lived with him and literally spent all his money at once.

His debut album ([r=927057]) is a  mixture of skiffle, folk and improvised blues music. After that album and the unexpected international success that followed, things started to go wrong. One example is [a282489] who had a hit with ""Cheveux longs, idées courtes"" which was a copy of one of Grignard's arrangements, but Hallyday didn't pay royalties for it.

Grignard changed record-companies from Philips to Barclay, but the first Barclay-album ""Captain Disaster"" didn't do as well as expected. Two come backs (early and late seventies) failed as well.

He died in Antwerp of throat cancer in 1982, at that time he was living on an attic without heating, surrounded with empty bottles.

His music and legacy has inspired many other groups like [a74984], [a105325] and [a877853] for instance.

The 1969 self titled album, ‘Robin Wilson’ is a minor classic of late 60s adult contemporary pop, triangulated somewhere between Harpers Bizarre, Barbra Streisand and Petula Clark. 

Wilson, a fetching brown-eyed brunette with a cute pageboy haircut and a tendency towards performing barefoot in a sailor suit, was born and raised in Hawaii and got her start working in the resort hotels on the islands. Her rich voice, which could manage both a brassy Ethel Merman bellow and a flirtatious croon, got her noticed by the headliners, which landed the young singer in Las Vegas and on the Merv Griffin Show, (which led to her being signed to A&M Records). 

Robin Wilson also straddled television appearance as herself and as a character
actress, along with music output through the late 60s early / mid 1970’s.

""Better Use Your Head/Bitter Honey"" was a Billboard Top 60 Spotlight Pick on January 1, 1972.

He acquired his nickname because people in the clubs assumed that the name inscribed on his second-hand guitar was his. Rusty became Jimmie Skinner’s right hand man, working in his record store as well as playing banjo, resonator guitar, and electric lead guitar with Jimmie as the occasion demanded. He cut some rockabilly sides for Gateway and King; “Sugaree” on Chess became a national hit. An original banjo instrumental on Mercury was called “Dixie Strut.” He also recorded as Rusty York and the Kentucky Mountain Boys with Curly Tuttle on mandolin, Billy Thomas on fiddle, Bill Lanham on guitar, Herman Kress on bass, and himself on banjo. He fronted Bobby Bare’s band for a while and worked in Las Vegas, but eventually decided his future lay in his Jewel Recording Studio, which he began in his garage in 1961 and later moved to 1594 Kinney Avenue in the Cincinnati suburb of Mt.

There followed important collaborations with directors such as [a1549141], [a467451], [a3153386], [a4424119], [a4424126], Roland Joffé and [a4424108]. Despite inevitable self-repetitions over a total of more than 400 film scores, his work provides many examples of a highly original fusion of classical and popular idioms.
Morricone's non-film works form a large and increasingly widely performed part of his output. Many of them use his technique of ‘micro-cells’, a pseudo-serial approach often incorporating modal and tonal allusions, which, with its extreme reduction of compositional materials, has much in common with his film-music techniques.
Among honours, he won the Academy Award in 2016 for his score to [a=Quentin Tarantino]'s The Hateful Eight and has received five Academy Award nominations between 1979 and 2001, a Grammy and a Leone d'oro, and was awarded the Laurea ad Honorem by the University of Cagliari. Between 1991 and 1996 he taught film music at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana, Siena."

Carter landed a gig on the Louisiana Hayride during the 1950s, and cut a few rockabilly-oriented singles before joining Roy Orbison's band. He performed on several records with the rock icon and later toured with roots-rocker Ronnie Hawkins and his band, the Hawks - a group that eventually morphed into The Band. Years later, Carter was recruited to play in drummer Levon Helms' easygoing jam-band, the RCO All-Stars.
In the early 1960s, Carter moved to Nashville and became one of the town's most in-demand musicians, playing on sessions such as Bob Dylan's pioneering country-rock records, and perhaps most famously on Simon & Garfunkel's mega-hit, ""The Boxer."" 
In 1968 he purchased the Nugget record label from the country comedy team of Lonzo & Oscar. Carter owned the label and ran his own Fred Carter Studios in Goodlettsville, Tennessee from 1968-1975, when financial pressure made him fold up shop.

He went To Lodge Professional School, a high school in New York that trained actors (a sort of 'Fame' type place). It seems his main 'skill' back then was his dancing ability. In 1957, he was based out of Bridgeport and was performing locally as a 'hillbilly' singer (doing a cowboy type song  show). He then got involved with shows staged by the University of Bridgeport (around 1958/59). In 1959, he enlisted in the US Air Force and was sent to a base in Texas. No doubt his spell in the air force resulted in him 'living all over the US'. After his stint in the air force was over, he returned to Connecticut and he next turns up in the New York area trying to land a record deal. This he did, initially with Holton and then RCA.
As by the mid 60's, soul type songs were dominating the charts, Holton seemed to have got him to record stuff in a similar mode. In summer 1966, he was holding down an engagement singing in a Norwalk, Connecticut restaurant (accompanying himself on the organ), so his Holton record deal doesn't seem to have raised his profile that much. When signed to RCA in 67, he was sent on visits to radio stns as far afield as Chicago to plug his records. He also had a spell in LA (1968) during which he played lots of live shows (perhaps he was trying to break into acting as well). In the mid to late 70's he was living in Baltic, Connecticut (a small place between Hartford & Providence). So by 1978, he would have been 40 years old and probably gave up his dream to make it as a recording star around then and took a 9-to-5 job."

In September 2004, Armond Morales transferred ownership of the name ""The Imperials"" to the lineup at the time: son Jason Morales, Jeremie Hudson, Ian Owens and Shannon Smith. This version of the group released two albums on Lamon Records, [r12388713] and [r12388798], consisting of re-recordings of older Imperials tunes.
