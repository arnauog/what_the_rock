135246,0,857875,US,Nancy Sinatra,How Does It Feel?,1998,0.0,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Pop Rock'],"American singer and actress, born June 8, 1940.

She is the daughter of singer/actor [a52833], and remains best known for her 1966 signature hit ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"". Other defining recordings include ""Sugar Town"", the 1967 number one ""Somethin' Stupid"" (a duet with her father), the title song from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, several collaborations with [a225403] such as ""Jackson"", and her cover of Cher's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"", which features during the opening sequence of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.

Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in the early 1960s, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"", which showed her provocative but good-natured style, and which popularized and made her synonymous with go-go boots. 
The promo clip featured a big-haired Sinatra and six young women in tight tops, go-go boots and mini-skirts. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including the critical and cult favorite ""Some Velvet Morning"". 

In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured [a=Billy Strange] as arranger and conductor. Sinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-60s including a co-starring role with [a=Elvis Presley] in the movie Speedway, and with [a=Peter Fonda] in The Wild Angels."

264349,120019,692636,Europe,Hootie & The Blowfish,Musical Chairs,1998,48.65,14,"['Album', 'HDCD']",['Rock'],['Southern Rock'],"With the rich, bluesy vocals of Darius Rucker and gleeful harmonies of guitarist Mark Bryan, bassist Dean Felber and drummer Jim “Soni” Sonefeld, Hootie & the Blowfish sold over 25 million records worldwide after their infectious melodies hit the airwaves in 1994 with hits such as “Hold My Hand”, “Let Her Cry” and “Only Wanna Be With You.”

One of the biggest misconceptions to most people is that Hootie & The Blowfish became an overnight success in 1994 when their debut album Cracked Rear View, moved over 16 million copies (and counting) in the U. S. alone. What most people don’t know was that the album’s triumph came after a decade of hard work.

The quartet met while attending the University of South Carolina in Columbia in the late 1980s. New freshman Mark Bryan heard Darius Rucker singing in the showers of the dorm they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability. Bryan and Rucker began playing cover tunes as The Wolf Brothers and eventually hooked up with Dean Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan’s, and Brantley Smith as Hootie & The Blowfish. (The unlikely moniker was borrowed from the nicknames of two college friends.) When Smith’s true passion called him home to Greenville, SC in 1989, Bryan reached out to classmate Jim (Soni) Sonefeld to join the band and the immediate chemistry was undeniable!

By the time they graduated, endless gigs at frat parties and local bars had built a major local buzz. “We’d started adding original material to our repertoire,” Bryan recalled. “Our songs went over well, so we decided to see if we could make a career out of it. Even if we hadn’t had a hit, I know we’d still be making music today, because it’s exactly what we want to be doing.”

The band’s secret weapon, and the force that pulls all of its diverse influences together, is the voice of Darius Rucker, an expressive instrument brimming with gritty soul and subtle wit. When he sings, the songs are imbued with a buoyant good humor and an openhearted joy that connects on an almost spiritual level with audiences all over the world. “Having Darius in the band is a wonderful luxury,” Mark Bryan explained. “We can try something funky, or bluegrassy or a ballad; we can run the gamut stylistically, but never stray too far from our sound because once Darius starts singing, it’s Hootie and the Blowfish.

In the next five years, Hootie & The Blowfish worked their way up the food chain from local draw to gigs all over the Carolinas and finally, the entire East Coast. Their blend of pop, folk, blues, soul and rock made them hard to pigeonhole, but easily accessible to anyone who loved good music. Atlantic Records, impressed by the tens of thousands of Kootchypop copies already sold without the help of a label, signed them and released Cracked Rear View in 1994. The album had been out for six months before the band played on the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman told his audience “If you don’t have this album, there’s something wrong with you.” The day after the show aired, sales went from four or five thousand a week to 17,000 a week, and eventually Number One on the Billboard charts the following spring. It remains a strong seller today. “It became dream-like,” Rucker recalled. “I’d wished for it, but I’m not sure I believed it, even as it was happening. We were on tour constantly; the whole thing is still kind of a blur.”

At the end of the year, Cracked Rear View and the band won two Grammy’s – Best New Artist and Song of the Year by duo or group for “Let Her Cry.” They also took home an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist for “Hold My Hand,” a Billboard Music Award for album of the year, a People’s Choice Award for Album of the Year and a People’s Choice Award for Best Selling Artist, a feat they duplicated in 1996.

Cracked Rear View went on to earn the band Billboard’s Band of the Year Award in 1996 and the RIAA’s Diamond Award for sales of 10 million units. Cracked Rear View remains the 9th best selling album in music business history, and all albums combined, have moved over 25 million worldwide.

The band kept touring, remaining a top draw nationwide and released five more albums for Atlantic: Fairweather Johnson, Musical Chairs, Scattered, Smothered & Covered, Hootie & The Blowfish and The Best of Hootie & The Blowfish. The band left Atlantic by mutual agreement in 2004; Looking For Lucky released in 2005 was their first album on their own Sneaky Long Records, manufactured and distributed by Vanguard. LIVE in Charleston, The Homegrown Concert Event DVD and CD was released in August of 2006.

Hootie & the Blowfish wrapped a summer of touring in 2008 and members entered the studio to record solo albums. Since then, Soni has released 4 albums including a trilogy called Found (2012), In (2014) and Love (2015). Mark has released 3 albums with his most recent release, Songs of the Fortnight in Summer 2017 and Darius released his fifth country album, When Was The Last Time in Fall 2017.

In December of 2018, the band appeared on the Today Show to announce a return to full-time touring along with news of a forthcoming album. The 2019 Group Therapy Tour saw the band play to sold-out crowds across the U.S. and Canada, including two nights at the iconic Madison Square Garden, as well as a run of shows throughout the U.K. and Ireland. The triumphant return to the road earned Hootie & the Blowfish several prominent profiles recognizing their important musical legacy, including the cover story of the New York Times Arts & Leisure section. On November 1, 2019, they released their first new music in nearly 15 years with Imperfect Circle, named one of the “biggest albums to hear this season” by Entertainment Weekly and featuring radio single “Hold On.”"

MMMBop was in first place in the charts in 27 countries and in 1998 gave the band three Grammy nominations.

After this it became a bit quieter around Hanson, but in the last few years they released 5 albums. Namely 'This Time Around' (2000), 'Underneath' (2004), 'The Walk' (2007), 'Shout It Out' (2011), Anthem (2013). They released the last 4 albums under their own management. After difficulties with their last record company, they decided to start their own record company, which was baptized 3CG Records.

On their previous album The Walk you will find the song ""Great Divide"" that can be downloaded via the internet and the proceeds of which go to HIV / AIDS and poverty alleviation in Africa.

In June 2011 they gave a performance at the Pinkpop music festival in the Netherlands. In 2011 the band had a guest role in the clip of Katy Perry: Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F)

Burried Onondaga County Veterans Memorial Cemetery
Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York, USA

Born Ruben Armand Mardones, he was raised in Maryland and during his youth, his interest in music was sparked when he saw Elvis Presley perform on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Following service with the United States Navy during the Vietnam War, he landed a job as a staff songwriter with CBS Publishing where he was partnered with Alan Miles. The two penned the single ""Too Heavy to Carry"" for Brenda Lee which appeared on her 1970 album ""Memphis Portrait."" During the 1970s, he formed the band ""Justice"" and launched his solo career with his debut album ""Thank God for Girls"" (1978). His follow up album ""Never Run, Never Hide"" (1980) contained the single ""Into the Night"" which reached number 11 on the American Pop Chart.

Touted by Variety as ""hyperkinetic"" and always on the make, Benny Mardones was nicknamed ""The Voice"" due to his near four-octave vocal range and soulful, passionate delivery. Mardones’ favorite song to perform was his hit “Into The Night,” the song he co-wrote which remains one of the top 25 most played singles in the history of radio, gracing the airwaves over 10,000,000 times. It is also one of the only songs to have ever charted three separate versions of the song as a single by the same artist.

Mardones, enjoyed an extremely successful twenty-five years as a songwriter and showman. He shared the stage with Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones, and played alongside legends such as the Otis Redding band. In a Showtime tribute to rock icon Roy Orbison, Benny performed with the likes of Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, and Johnny Cash. Mardones' ability to compose music that transcended generational gaps and typical pop-rock-r&b genre pigeonholes had much to do with his achingly honest lyrics and soulful delivery. As Rolling Stone quipped, his ""gloriously adolescent romanticism"" appeals to all regardless of age or musical background.

Pursuing a rigorous touring schedule over the years, despite his diagnosis with Parkinson's, Benny gathered his strength from his passion for performing and his adoring fans. He noted that, ""There are days where I wonder if I am going to be able to use these vocal chords...if my legs are going to hold me up. But at this point in my life, my fans are almost family -- they support me and they help keep me going. As long as they want to hear me sing, as long as they want to come to the shows, I will pour every last drop of myself into performing.""

Benny’s first album of all original music since 1999 was entitled, “Let's Hear it For Love” — a torrent of fiery arena rock splashed tunes with catchy hooks and melodic twists, produced and co-written by Warrior Records’ president, Jim Ervin. The release was dedicated to Mardones’ long-time road manager and dear friend, Tommy Piraino, who passed away during the recording from leukemia.

The song, ""Just for you my friend,"" which features a short appearance from Tommy's son, was penned as Benny grieved. ”There are a number of extremely personal tracks on the album that I almost considered not including,” said Mardones. “But, I realized that one of the reasons my friends and fans have been so supportive of me over the years, is that I refuse to hold back. You come to my shows or listen to my albums you get 100% uncensored me.""

Benny died peacefully at his home in Menifee, CA on June 29, 2020 with his loving wife at his side. He passed away from complications of Parkinson’s disease. He leaves behind his only son who now has a child of his own. "

America are still touring and releasing live and studio albums and consists nowadays, in their 16th personnel line-up, of the core duo of Beckley & Bunnell with [a=Willie Leacox] (drums/percussion), [a=Michael Woods (4)] (guitar/vocals) and [a=Rich Campbell] (bass/vocals).
Peek & Beckley have both released solo material.

His best known composition is ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" for the movie ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Various-Arthur-The-Album/master/157691]Arthur[/url]"" starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli. 
The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1981 (shared award with Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen).

Cross played with an Austin group called Flash before signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records, thanks to which he released his debut album, ""Christopher Cross"" in 1979 for which he won 5 Grammy awards. He received in the same gala the 4 main prizes that are: best recording, best song, best album and best new artist. Of this album they emphasize the songs ""Sailing"", ""Ride Like the Wind"" and ""Never Be the Same"".

His second album, [i]Another Page[/i] released in 1983 included the songs, ""Think of Laura"" and ""All Right"".

The song ""Think Of Laura"" has nothing to do with the characters Luke and Laura from the soap opera [i]General Hospital[/i]. He allowed ABC to use the song in this context; however, he has stated that he wrote ""Think of Laura"" not in reference to the television characters, but to celebrate the life of Denison University college student Laura Carter who was killed when she was struck by a stray bullet.

Cross contributed voices in the 1985 David Lee Roth song called ""California Girls"" and also voiced Alan Parsons' song ""So Far Away"" and has once come up with him on stage to play it.

The song ""Loving Strangers (David's theme)"" is part of the soundtrack of the movie [url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Various-Nothing-In-Common-Original-Soundtrack/master/415115][i]Nothing In Common[/i][/url] from 1986, with Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason.

His daughter Madison Cross is a singer and actress.

The oldest son of Peter Griffin in the series [i]Family Guy[/i] is named Christopher Cross Griffin.

Since 1981, Christopher held the record of being the only artist to win the so-called ""Big Four"" of the Grammy Awards in a single ceremony: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist.  Billie Eilish achieved the same feat in 2020 becoming the second person, the youngest person, and the first woman to do so."

That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs.

It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks.

With the help of famed Indonesian producer Ian Antono, in 1986 Anggun released her first rock-influenced studio album, Dunia Aku Punya. She became further well known with the single ""Mimpi"" (1989), which was listed as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone. She followed it with a series of singles and three more studio albums, which established her as one of the most prominent Indonesian rock stars of the early 1990s.

Anggun left Indonesia in 1994 to pursue an international career. After two years struggling in London and Paris, she met French producer Erick Benzi and signed to Sony Music Entertainment. Her first international album, Snow on the Sahara (1997), was released in 33 countries and became the best-selling album by an Asian artist outside Asia. Since then, Anggun has released another six studio albums as well as a soundtrack album to the Danish film Open Hearts (2002). Her singles, ""Snow on the Sahara"" and ""What We Remember"", entered the Billboard charts in the United States, while ""In Your Mind"", ""Saviour"" and ""I'll Be Alright"" charted on the Billboard European Hot 100 Singles.

Anggun is the Asian artist with the highest album sales outside Asia, with her releases being certified gold and platinum in some European countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received a number of accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France and the World Music Award for World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist.

Sparklejet is the tried and true, all-American rock band. Born in the unlikely agricultural hub of Central California, the Fresno-based group has settled into a stripped-down, power-trio lineup where they find themselves at the height of their ability to convey uncompromising power and urgency.
The band bounces effortlessly across the rock landscape, drawing from the likes of past and current heroes including The Replacements, Pixies, Hüsker Dü, The Kinks, Guided By Voices, The Police, Foo Fighters, Devo, Led Zeppelin, and The Who. Speaking of Townshend and the boys, Sparklejet performed its own rendition of The Who's ""Tommy"" in 2002.
Sparklejet's 11-track album, Beyond the Beyond, was released on Los Angeles-based Long Live Crime Records. The trio's earlier releases include 1998's This Year's Model and 2001's Bar Guest. On Beyond the Beyond, Sparklejet strayed from the usual Fresno recording studios and instead worked with Steve Albini (Pixies, Nirvana, PJ Harvey) at his Electrical Audio studio in Chicago.
The band's latest recording, 2014's Phonovella, has been released on the Narcissus Records imprint. The 13-track album features the band expanding and refining its approach to the three-piece rock band format. Sparklejet has toured throughout the Northwest, having shared the stage with bands like Kaito, Silversun Pickups, Earlimart, the Mother Hips, Radar Bros., Pine Martin, the High Speed Scene and others.
The trio has been featured in Billboard Magazine's Best New Artist spotlight, and their music has been used on ESPN's ""Extreme Games."" They have not taken a contrived, anti-social punk rock stance or infused their music with any such self-defeating message. Simply put, they don't try to be anything except who they are by nature. No trendy clothes, no fancy haircuts, just rock.

Band history
1979-1987 - lineup #1

Secret Service is a Swedish pop/new wave band, originally formed 1979. [a98922], former vocalist of [a380822] and then a publishing manager at Sonet Music, teamed up with [a98924] and [a282399] to write a few songs that they submitted to Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualifiers for the European Song Contest. They did not win but decided to continue working together and changed their band's name from Ola+3 to Secret Service. Besides Ola Håkansson (vocals), Tim Norell and Ulf Wahlberg (keyboards), the original lineup included Tonny Lindberg (guitars), Leif Paulsen (bass) and ​Leif Johansson (drums, ex Ola & the Janglers).

Tim Norell however, who along with lyric writer [a486079] (no relation), penned most songs of the band, did not appear with the band on stage or on the album covers. Secret Service's first single ""Oh Susie"" became a hit in Sweden and several other countries of Europe and South America. ""Oh Susie"" was no 1 in 29 countries.

The same titled album included another hit, ""Ten O'clock Postman"" Other singles followed, with their synthesizer based number ""Flash in the Night"" hitting the charts all over continental Europe. Later, Ola Håkansson sang duet with ex-ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog, ""The Way You Are"".

1987 - lineup #2

In 1987, Håkansson, Norell, and Wahlberg released ""Aux Deux Magots"", their sixth album as Secret Service. The other members of the band had quit by then and were replaced by multi-instrumentalist Anders Hansson and bassist Mats Lindberg. Björn Håkanson had at that time left the group as lyricist and Ola had taken over that part together with Alexander Bard. (Army Of Lovers)

1988-2000 - Hiatus
1988, Håkansson, Norell, and Wahlberg decided to go separate ways. Håkansson continued as Norell's partner together with Anders Hansson and became a well known songwriting trio. In 1992, Håkansson and his associates established Stockholm Records as a joint venture with Polygram. They produced Army Of Lovers and The Cardigans, among others.

Wahlberg continued working as a producer, songwriter with both local and international artists. He started his own company XTC Productions in 1989 launching Swedish artists abroad. He also started up his own professional recording studio - XTC Studios.

2000 - Reunion
1999 Ola, Ulf and Tim got together to compile a new compilation with Secret Service songs, Top Secret – Greatest Hits. The work took place in XTC Studios and it all led to the recording of four new tracks for the album.

2006 Forward, Member lineup #3

Secret Service had fans in the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe during the Cold War. Faced with a 1980's gala in Moscow in December 2006, Ulf and Tim re-assembled the band, however, with a new lineup. Because of family and business reasons Ola decided to not join the band at live performances and tours. So together with Mats Lindberg (bass) from the 2nd lineup, they invited Mikael Erlandsson (vocals and guitar) and Jaime Borger (drums) to join the new live version of the band. Since then the band has successfully toured all over Russia and other territories with this lineup.

2012 ""The Lost Box""

2012 was the time for a world-wide release of ”The Lost Box”. An album consisting of more or less forgotten and never completed songs from the years behind, but very well achieved by the audience. The album was also distributed as a vinyl album 2017 by B-Stars. 

2019 
On Dec 3, 2019 the band released the single “GO ON”, with music and lyrics by Tim Norell. The arrangement is made in collaboration with Anders Hansson.

2020
On April 10, 2020, the second song in the Secret Service project ”Four Seasons” was released: ”Secret Mission”. Written by Tim Norell and arranged by Anders Hansson. Lead vocals by new singer Johan (AKA John) Becker, with Tim Norell and Ulf Wahlberg on backing vocals."

In 1992 Sarah’s voice was ""discovered"" and she released a solo single under the name ""Sara Beth"". The single faired well in the Belgian charts, and the record company Double T Music offered her a contract for a full album. Gert joined Sarah for a trial acoustic session, and hence ""The Choice"" was born. In October 1993, their first full CD ""The Great Subconscious Club"" was presented to the press.
In 1994 succes was increasing, in Europe as well as in the USA. In the USA a band called ""The Choice"" claimed they had rights over the name; to avoid confusion and potential lawsuits, Sarah and Gert decided to change the bandname to ""K's Choice"". The ""K"" is taken from Jozef K, the key protagonist in Kafka's ""The Trial"" who ironically, is continually confronted with situations where he has limited choices. 
In the autumn of 1995, ""Paradise in Me"", the band's second studio album, was released. The album was heavier and more guitar-orientated than the debut ""The Great Subconscious Club"". 
The band released 4 studio albums prior to 2001. In 2002 they went on a break, pursuing soloprojects.
One decade after their last album the band released their fifth studio album ""Echo Mountain"" in 2010.

The group was founded by guitarist June Millington and her sister, bassist Jean, who had been playing music together since they moved from the Philippines to California in the early 1960s. After playing in several bands, they attracted the interest of producer Richard Perry who signed them to Reprise Records in 1969 as Fanny. The band recorded four albums together before June Millington quit the group. Following a final album, Fanny disbanded in 1975. The Millington sisters have continued to play music together since the split, and formed the spin-off group [a=Fanny Walked the Earth] in 2018.

The group has continued to attract critical acclaim for rejecting typical girl group styles and expectations of women in the rock industry generally, and emphasizing their musical skills. Later groups, such as [a=The Bangles] and [a=The Runaways], cited Fanny as a key influence.

Throughout the ‘80s he played in a variety of bands on the neo-’60s/psych/garage/punk scene, while recording a string of independent releases with producer Lou Whitney of the Morells fame.

After relocating to Kansas City in 1989, Joey reformed the Joey Skidmore Band with guitarist Mike Costelow in 1991. ""The first time Mike and I jammed together, we walked outside and saw this big, barren tree full of thousands and thousands of squawking crows, just like something out of Hitchcock’s ‘The Birds.’ I took it as a good omen, and played together for the next 16 years.""

In 1992 Joey and Mike flew to France to do a series of ""unplugged"" acoustic shows, encouraged by the success of Joey’s two previous albums ""The Word Is Out"" and ""Welcome To Humansville""--which had received a substantial amount of ""alternative"" airplay in France and Belgium. ""Butt Steak"" (a politically incorrect song about food) was also receiving airplay domestically on the Doctor Demento show, and had achieved cult status among New Yorkers, thanks to WFMU’s The Hound show. Subsequent releases have had tracks played on diverse radio shows such as 'Car Talk' and 'Nights with Alice Cooper.'

The French gigs led to a deal with Dixie Frog Records, and ""Joey Skidmore"" came out in France in 1994. One of the songs, ""Creature of Habit,"" resulted in an unreleased dance remix for Carrier Records, but ""Joey Skidmore Turns Pop"" featuring two Iggy Pop covers, was released on green vinyl on the independent 442 eme Rue label in 1996.

In 2000 ""Butt Steak"" was included on a ""best of MP3"" CD ROM, with the band receiving a page and a half write-up in The Complete Idiot’s Guide To MP3, by Nat Gertler and Rod Underhill, with a foreword by Byrd’s legend Roger McGuinn.

The current lineup includes Joey, vocals and guitar, Gary Paredes, lead guitar, and Cory Corbino, bass. The group has released seven albums including ""Ventriloquist Doll,"" featuring the late Nikki Sudden.

Over the years the Joey Skidmore Band has played festivals including SXSW in Austin TX, Summer Jam in Kansas City, July Jamm in Lincoln NE, Big Muddy Blues and Roots Festival in St. Louis MO and Skid-O-Rama Fest in Kansas City. They’ve done five tours of France, and opened up for an eclectic variety of acts including Chuck Berry, Helmet, Blue Oyster Cult, Webb Wilder, Nazareth, Gravity Kills, George Thorogood, the Shadows of Knight and Black Oak Arkansas. They play pure, unpretentious rock and roll."

The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

342309,307703,4708075,Japan,Acid House Kings,Advantage Acid House Kings,1997,34.22,12,['Album'],"['Rock', 'Pop']",['Indie Pop'],"Sweden’s no.1 pop band, Acid House Kings, was formed in 1991 by brothers Niklas and Johan Angergård and Joakim Ödlund. With immaculate taste in music stemming from a childhood of Elvis Presley, an almost complete set of Sarah singles and a 100% complete set of the Smiths singles, the Kings set out to define pop music.

Between 1992 and 2002, inspired by the 10 albums in 10 years from Felt, Acid House Kings released a trilogy of albums with one album released every fifth year. The first, “Pop, look & listen!” (1992) is maybe best left unmentioned. The Kings rate it 2.4 out of 5. On the second, “Advantage Acid House Kings” (1997), the aim was to make a Smiths-for-very-sunny-days sort of album. This sort of succeeded, and the Kings rate it 3.8 out of 5.

In 2001, the Kings built their own, now famous, Summersound Studios. Here, Acid House Kings could spend endless amounts of time to create the more sophisticated third album “Mondays are like Tuesdays and Tuesdays are like Wednesdays” (2002). Former guest vocalist and present sister-in-law Julia Lannerheim was introduced as a full-time member while Joakim Ödlund never showed up for recordings. It’s an easy, breezy, beautiful album and the kings rate it 4.2 out of 5.

Spurred by the quality of “Mondays…”, Acid House Kings set out to break their own five years between albums record, while still yet again refining the meaning of pop music. The fourth album, “Sing along with Acid House Kings” (2005), is to date the crown jewel in the Acid House Kings catalogue and a should-have-been-in-the-Guinness-World-Records-book since it included a karaoke-DVD (yes, a karaoke-DVD) with the first 2000 copies. The press release stated untrendy is the new trend, while the music showed an unusual combination of sophistication and catchiness. The Kings rate the album 4.4 out of 5.

In the spring of 2011 Sweden’s pop perfectionists no. 1 finally returned with the new album “Music Sounds Better with You”. The band first started the recording the album in the year 2008, but after three months and with more than half the album finished they decided to scrap it. Reason? They weren’t completely sure they would top their previous album and considered the songs too dark and not melodic enough for The Kings.

In the beginning of 2010 Acid House Kings returned with new inspiration, a brighter mood and numerous new songs. According to the band the new album is “Music Sounds Better with You”. It also got castanets on every single song. -“Music Sounds Better with You” will not re-define pop music, but it may very well define it, states Julia Lannerheim"

Lou Ford, a band based in Charlotte, NC, named itself after a character from a Jim Thompson novel. The fictional Lou Ford was someone comprised of various layers, where what you saw on the surface wasn't really the whole story. The musical Lou Ford likes to describe itself the same way. At first glance, audiences and critics dubbed them country. Underneath, bandmembers say, they really are is more pop-oriented. The only things remotely country about the group, according to guitarist and vocalist Alan Edwards, are the bandmembers' soft Southern drawls. Before forming Lou Ford in Charlotte with his brother Chad Edwards, Alan Edwards was a member of Chocolate U.S.A. in New York, along with Julian Koster. Alan Edwards was a veteran traveler who spent time in several states, including Virginia, Georgia, and New York. On his travels through North Carolina, he became acquainted with bass player Mark Lynch while both were attending a Backsliders show. Seeing the makings of a band in his growing friendship with Lynch, he invited his brother to relocate from Georgia to North Carolina. Eventually they added Darrell Ussery on drums and John Morris on organ. Morris formerly was a member of Come on Thunderchild. The band's current lineup consists of Alan Edwards and Chad Edwards, both of whom sing and play guitar; Ussery on drums; Jason Atkins on organ and piano; and Jeffrey Larish on bass. At one time, the band also included Shawn Lynch, who was not related to Mark Lynch.

In his first acoustic live gigs he was assisted by Makis Petratos, then member of Next Time Passions. 

When he was preparing his first solo 7"" for This Happy Feeling in 1994 the people who helped him were again Makis P, who also recorded and produced it, and Dimitris ( now D.F.A.) on drums and saxophone. Zisimos and Makis worked so well together that, after their bands split, they decided to collaborate permanently, thus turning the Crooner into a duo.

Their love for pop and also electronic music led the Crooner to a new direction, a mixture of  pure pop with some electronic elements, which evolved day by day. The first signs of this evolution came with ""Alberto Caeira"", a song featured in the first Shelflife Rec. compilation in 1996. Then ""Heaven Airlines"" followed in the same label, which attracted the attention of a larger public, and the interest of Japanese labels. In this CD, Miss Honeybeetle joined the band on vocals, and they tried to find a balance between their early acoustic sound, and their electronic influences. The song ""Over the Rainbow"" also attracted the attention of Bungalow Rec, and included it in their ""Atomium 3003"" Club Pop compilation. Club pop ? Well, almost. 

The second Crooner release, ""Soft Escape"" (CD on Pop Art Rec.), manages to express pop music as a free form art, combining everything from bossanova, to ambient, to j-pop, to house music. This CD also features Miss Honeybeetle, as well as Natasha. The CD was co-produced by Hyplar, who also produced most of the bonus tracks on the Japanese release of ""Heaven Airlines"""

A few months later Michelle Ferguson would join, and the live Shakespace became possible. Many shows later, they recorded their first full-length CD. Released In 1998, the self-titled debut album was a space rock, lo-fi collection recorded in Chapel Hill, NC and Roanoke, and was released on their own No Phase Records label.

""Robert & The Daisiez (AKA ""RATD"") were formed in 1994 by Robert Greenwood (vocals, bass), Shane Hatfield (guitar, drum machine) and Mike Johnson (guitar) in Independence, MO ""out of boredom."" The group's mutual love of music would hold the trio together for the next two years. During that period of time, the band recorded and released three albums, ""Honey-Bran Muffins"" (1994, Muffin Music/Gang Recordings), ""Live In '95"" (1995, UTR Records) and ""Go Chicken Go!"" (1996, Burning Circus Records).

In January of 1997, the band opted to let go of Johnson, citing ""creative differences,"" and continued on for the next seven months as a two-piece. During that period, Greenwood and Hatfield compiled a ""best-of"" album, ""The Daisy Police: Car 69"" (1997, Burning Circus). The album not only featured the band's favorite past recordings, but included a few new tracks as well. In July of 1997, the band brought in Hatfield's brother, bassist Steve Williams.

The new trio, Greenwood (vocals), Hatfield (guitars, drum machine, keys) and Williams (bass), recorded ""Rock 'n' Roll G-Dogg"" (1998, Burning Circus) and showcased the new material at the DAYFest Music Festival in August 1998. Having trouble in the heat, the band invited ex-Daisy Johnson, who was in attendance, onstage to perform. He helped close the show with the band's trademark ""Go Chicken Go!"" This marked the first and last time all four members of the band performed onstage together.

The band released a special album commemorating Johnson's return later that year, ""Penguins In The Smoke"" (1998, Burning Circus). It featured new music (as well as some old tracks) and even a remix.

In 2000, the band decided to hang it up, with the original lineup playing their final show that January.

Even though the idea came up from time to time over the next few years to reform the band, there was no RATD activity until late in 2005, when Hatfield came across some old video footage of the band. The footage, shot between 1996 and 1998, was originally intended for a home video that was never made. It would be nearly two more years after the discovery before that video was finally completed. On Friday, July 13, 2007, ""Lucky 13"" was finished just in time to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the band's formation. A special screening was held on July 14, and the film was officially launched online on Christmas Day. A career retrospective CD from UTR Records, also titled ""Lucky 13,"" had been distributed freely Memorial Day weekend.

On December 12, 2009, the band officially released a 10-track digital compilation, ""Lost In The Smoke,"" for free on their MySpace page, highlighting their years with Burning Circus Records (1996-98). Selected from four different albums and a live concert, these tracks truly define the band at the top of their game.

The band released a love song EP titled ""A Trip To The Clinic"" online on September 6, 2011. It features three tracks, highlighted by ""The Swing"" (available for the first time ever).

RATD released a three-song EP titled ""Cheap Drinks"" on January 3, 2012, available exclusively on their Bandcamp page (ratd.bandcamp.com). The release contains two tracks (a radio edit of ""Huggy Bear"" and a Dr. Hugo remix of ""Go Chicken Go!"") that were previously available only on promotional compilations and one track (""Rock The House!"") that is available for the first time.

""Paradise"" was released as a special summer single on July 5, 2012.

""Hardcore From Main Street"" was released as a single on August 16, 2013.

On October 22, 2013, the band released a three-song Halloween-themed remix EP titled ""Demonized"", featuring three classic tracks ""twisted for your Halloween pleasure!""

A new EP, ""3 Hits From Heaven"", was released on February 25, 2014 to kick-off the band's 20th anniversary. The lead track, ""You're Not Cool"", went on to win an OurStage.com ""Top 40"" Award for charting at number 36 for the month of April on the site's ""Alternative"" chart.

The band reissued their 1998 album, ""Rock 'n' Roll G-Dogg"", on September 16, 2014, both digitally and on limited edition cd. The cd features new artwork and several bonus tracks.

The band participated in Cassette Store Day 2014 on September 27, 2014 by offering a special cassette titled ""Back on Tape After 20 Years"" (limited to only 50 copies).""

In February 2015, it was announced that the band had landed a spot on a limited edition, three-cassette compilation box set, ""400/100"", on Denmark's Metaphysical Circuits label. The collection, featuring RATD's new song ""Radioactive Bitches (Teleported)"", was released on June 12, 2015. The band appears alongside 43 other international artists in the three-hour-long collection, which was also released digitally."

2845371,1214968,3749320,US,Vaganza,Vaganza,1998,0.0,11,['Album'],['Rock'],['Alternative Rock'],"Vaganza was a decidedly excessive/theatrical art-rock-pop duo consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Longworth Wallingford and Quigley.

Dressed in spangled, space-aged, ""zoot suit"" type apparel, singing in rather brazenly affected voices, and accompanied by more or less a full orchestra (plus much other extraneous instrumentation) on nearly each of the ten tracks on their debut album, the one thing that is for certain is that they were not ""of"" their time.

Their first unofficial release was a 1994 demo entitled ""Are You Willing to Die for Rock 'n' Roll?"" The recording cost only $5,000, but was an overproduced and excessive affair all the same. Circulating this demo to various friends and those friends' friends, while decked out in their full regalia Vaganza were eventually able to generate something of an industry buzz even while lacking a live band and being mostly unknown to all.

Their self-titled debut, and only official, album was released in May 1998 on Geffen Records subsidiary Outpost Recordings. The gleefully overwrought longplayer was in part self-produced by Vaganza, with their friend and engineer Greg Frey also producing. It featured in addition to Quigley (vocals, bass, guitar, synthesizers) and Wallingford (vocals, guitar, piano, synthesizers, percussion) many guest musicians, most noteworthy being drummer Joey Waronker who has played drums with Beck, R.E.M. and The Smashing Pumpkins (among many other accomplishments too numerous to list here).

Within six months of their debut album's release they were dropped by Outpost Recordings. After eight years together, two major label record deals (for a couple of years prior to their signing with Outpost they'd been signed to a deal -- by legendary A&R man Terry Tolkin -- with Elektra Records that never resulted in a release), and only about a dozen live performances with their 10 piece live band (which included Modern Drummer Magazine favorite Zach Danziger and former Walt Mink mastermind John Kimbrough), Vaganza decided to call it a day.

Wallingford, as a teenager, had been the driving force behind Boston area band Astronaut. Astronaut were signed to Rough Trade's U.S. label just prior to that label going out of business. As a result of Rough Trade U.S. going bankrupt, and then soon thereafter Wallingford dedicating all of his energies to the then brand-new Vaganza endeavor, they never did release an album. Some believe that, with their distinctive, irreverent, yet sincere, and extremely melodic take on 1970s style boogie rock (in the vein of ZZ Top and Aerosmith), combined with raved up Detroit style Rock 'n' Roll (ala The Stooges and MC5, et al.), they very well may have made a name for themselves had they stuck around.

More recent years have found Wallingford as a married father of two, cabaret performer, avid chess player, and music teacher, living in the swamps of Jersey.

Quigley spent his teens playing bass with Twin/Tone recording artists Skunk."

When the previous vocalist decided to leave the band, management called upon Matt DeJoy who was working on a couple of different projects at the time. After just one rehearsal, he was granted the position of frontman and the band immediately began writing together. Within a month Agrokulcher had written enough material to go into the studio to work on their first E.P. titled ""God"".

Since then, the band has been performing and headlining up and down the west coast. Agrokulcher played at ""Camp Ozzy"" at Ozzfest, opened up for the band ""Live"" at Dennis Rodman's Birthday Bash at the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas and headlined the Tony Hawk Skate and Music Festival in the South Bay. They also were privileged enough to record two songs with punk legend Mike Watt. It was a tribute to legendary punk bonds from the South Bay. The album is available in record stores titled ""The Bay After"".

Agrokulcher's style of music is of n heavier genre, but the band has been influenced by the likes of Bowie, Tool, Depeche Mode, Snot, Primus, Faith No More, Deftones, you get the idea. AK has exploded out of the South Bay (Hermosa Beach, Ca.) and has gained much respect from the entire L.A. music scene as they play in Hollywood and surrounding areas constantly. In September '99, Agrokulcher was named ""Underground Band of the Month"" by both Loudside Entertainment (www.loudside.com) and ""Unsigned Band of the Month"" by Unenrthed.com. (www.unearthed.com). ""AK"" has also been given strong recognition by Artist Direct.com and Ubl.com.

In October of 2000 Agrokulcher took some time out of their busy schedule to record the follow up to their first E.P. This CD was appropriately titled ""2000"". This CD shows the great musical bond and growth that the band was able to form in a very fast paced year. Their sold out CD release party at the Troubadour (Hollywood, Ca.) was a huge success. It helped others in the tight nit community of Hollywood realize why there is such a buzz about this band that has only been together for a short time.

Agrokulcher is continuing on the tracks of many great Hollywood bands that have gone on to bigger careers while they continue to stay true to themselves. Their fans have made it perfectly clear what they want ...many more jaw dropping performances. It is very hard to not get lost among the thousands of heavy bands in Hollywood. Agrokulcher has made it a point to make their music and lyrical content very personable to themselves and those who make the right choice to really listen. Look for Agrokulcher to release a new Cd by the end of Summer 2001.

The band consists of Curtis (vocals bass / lead), Bill Keck (Guitar / vocals), and Chad Booher on drums. Then, the band has undergone some changes. They replaced Booher with another talented drummer by the name of Reg Rogers and then added a second guitarist, Mark (Martino) Dannells. Later, the band lost one of the guitarists Bill Keck, and then underwent another change. Curtis Clark then assumed leadership role by playing the guitar and the band added a very talented bassist by the name of James Britt. Now the band is ready to establish more modern pop rock tunes that Clark wrote so well. In June 2000, the band had the honor of winning an Emmy for his work on ""Have a Nice May"", which promoted FOX 5 Atlantas 1999 May sweeps. Moreover, BLPBs song ""If The Animals Could Talk"" was added (after being chosen from over 5000 songs) on the soundtrack to Road Rash: Jailbreak for Playstation and the song was voted as the best song of the game. The Blacklight Posterboys also contributed to a CD tribute to Paul McCartney in Atlanta who performed the song ""Jet"". The band, although getting great success, split up after only four years together. Separation was a surprise to many, because the band just had released their second full length album, Psychotic Love Songs in January 2000. Their last show was at Dark Horse on March 10."
2240224,904374,6825107,USA & Canada,Bobgoblin,Jet,1994,44.5,14,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Power Pop', 'Punk']","Power pop band from Dallas, Texas, with a sound influenced by punk, post-punk, new wave, and '70s glam and prog rock, and a lyrical and visual concept in which they are liberation fighters in a dystopian, fascistic future. During the late 1990s/early 2000s they renamed themselves The Adventures Of Jet, releasing two albums under that moniker.

Bobgoblin was formed in 1992 in Denton, Texas by University of North Texas students Hop Litzwire (lead vocals, keyboards) and Rob Avsharian (drums). With early members Hech MaHech (bass) and Lech Vogner (guitar), they formulated a fictitious concept in which the band was at the center of a future war between the fascistic, corporate-run State of the Republic and the smaller, sovereign Liberation Front States, which seek to preserve individual freedom. Within this fiction, the band are ""leaders of Black Market Party revolution rock"", its members part of a patrol group called the Liberation Front States Motor Forces (LFSMF). They adopted stage names, with Litzwire as ""Sgt. Hop Manski"" and Avsharian as ""Lt. Rob Avsharian"". The concept was reinforced with matching onstage uniforms and visuals.

MaHech and Vogner left in 1994 and guitarist/bassist Tony Jannotta (stage name ""Corporal Glascock"") joined, and Bobgoblin released their debut album, [i]Jet[/i], on their own independent imprint, Space Age Records. Signing to MCA Records, they released 1997's [i]The Twelve-Point Master Plan[/i]; guitarist Jason Weisenberg (stage name ""Pvt. J. Weisenburg"") joined after the album's recording. Disagreements with MCA led to the termination of their contract, and they re-launched themselves as The Adventures Of Jet (AOJ), abandoning the Bobgoblin concept and signing to My Records for 1999's [i]Part 3: Coping With Insignificance[/i], a record inspired by their negative experiences with MCA. Weisenberg left, with Jannotta resuming the dual role of guitarist and bassist, and AOJ released 2003's [i]Muscle[/i] on Suburban Home Records, combining themes of aging with musical inspiration from 1960s car songs.

AOJ became dormant, and Bobgoblin played occasional reunion shows over the next few years as the members pursued other paths. Litzwire became a documentary filmmaker and television producer, winning four Emmys, while Avsharian became a touring drummer for [a=The Rocket Summer] and the [a=Andy Timmons Band]. Bobgoblin reconvened in the late 2000s and have since released several digital singles, the video game-themed EP [i]Sinistar / Robotron Virtual 45[/i] (2014), and the album [i]Love Lost For Blood Lust[/i] (2015). Producer and engineer [a=Barry Poynter] played guitar on several of these releases."

One thing was certain — it was gonna be loud… ..Released in June 1998, their debut CD ""Something For Nothing"" was a collection of rock anthems for the new millennium.

The composite character of their compositions, supported by Glenn Rubenstein's songwriting abilities, also demonstrates the bands' better command of delivering solid tunes, despite the fusion of multiple styles. It was in 1995, in Petaluma, CA, that Rubenstein decided to put together his own band after years working in the concert promotion industry. The group originated as a rap duo, consisting of Glenn Rubenstein and Jeff Gerstmann. Rubenstein assumed the rap name ""G-man,"" derived from his early 1990s BBS handle. Gerstmann went by the moniker ""US Pipe,"" after a sign he had passed weekly on the 880 freeway when he worked temporarily transporting reels of film for a Bay Area cinema chain. The two were joined on-stage by Brendan Ducousso, who went by ""Gotti,"" and served as an anti ""hype man"" who commented on what the duo rapped about. Ducousso also contributed to the between song banter. Headboard's first show was December 19th, 1995 opening a concert at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma on a bill consisting of Maroon, 26 Miles Per Hour, and the headliner, Skillit. Headboard formed only two weeks before the date of the show, settling on the name only days before the concert and writing rap lyrics right up until showtime. The duo read many of their lyrics off paper while rapping over a montage of samples crafted into an eclectic mix of beats. Thrown together in the days leading up to the event, the group was selling cassette tapes of their ""Zip! Plop! EP"" at this first performance, tracked on a 4-track the night before.

In July of 1996 the group added a live band and began touring around California with an expanded mix of music stylings. Female vocals were added to the group to compliment Gerstmann and Rubenstein's rapping, and the musical styles mixed elements of rap, ska, funk, pop, alternative rock, and punk. At one point the band expanded to a total of 11 people--including [a=Christine Alexander] of [a=Little Tin Frog], and [a=Dominic Davi], who would later go on to form [a=Tsunami Bomb], both of whom played on Headboard's first self-released CD, ""Brendan Goes to College.""

In late 2001, Rubenstein toyed with working on a new musical project, but instead chose to collaborate with two of his previous Headboard bandmates, Josh Gooch and Alex Navarro. The trio auditioned dozens of applicants before deciding on three new female members to help re-shape Headboard's sound and extensive song catalog: Josh's sister, Sarah Gooch, joined on bass, and violinist/keyboard player Averil Bach shared female vocal duties. Utilizing over six year's worth of songs and lessons learned, this co-ed lineup quickly acheived momentum that re-sparked interest in the group. However, internal conflicts arose shortly after the group's recording of B-sides for the ""(We Are) The Same"" EP, and Headboard's final show was on February 21, 2002, in Vacaville, CA."

A bond was immediately formed, and music was undoubtedly a part of it. Bhowmik and Dubois, who are natives of Nashville, shared a love for Duran Duran and the like, but grabbed onto the rock rawness of The Replacements and Dinosaur Jr. by their early teens. Each saved their lunch money to by a Tascam 4-Track Recorder, too - the life of Ultrababyfat was born.

Bhowmik and Dubois separated for a brief time during college, but reconnected during the early nineties in Santa Cruz, CA. Music was still an obsession, so the idea of a band was more tangible. The two began writing songs like mad, but Bhowmik left California for law school in Atlanta in 1992. Naturally, Dubois tagged close behind and the band became a serious thought. As a joke, they called themselves Babyfat. Drummer Mauricio Carey and bassist Laurie Garnier joined Bhowmik and Dubois to make a debut album. Babyfat released Dragons Go Away on the local label Sister Ruby Records in 1995 and fun times were had.

As the nineties came to a close, Britta Phillips stepped in to play bass after the 1997 demise of her band, Belltower, and Shane Sanders filled the drum section. In 1998, they'd christened themselves Ultrababyfat and issued Silver Tones Smile. The album exuded the band's strong, post-punk/pop sound, and critics were quick to jump on the band. Unfortunately tides turned for Ultrababyfat, for they were without a label and a manager by the next year. Songwriting typically fueled the fire and Ultrababyfat spent the next two years perfecting sounds for a second album.

Phillips took a time out from UItrababyfat in spring 2000 by joining Luna for their North American tour after Justin Hazelwood left the band. She would eventually become a permanent member of Luna, but remained close with her Ultrababyfat bandmates. She can be heard on the foursome's second album, Eight Balls In Reverse, which appeared in fall 2001."

More than just a band, the Seattle-based rock ‘n’ roll group, Suitcase, is at the center of a musical family. Born of musical companionship and often found in the comfy confines of the historic Earwig Studio in the city’s Wallingford neighborhood, the group’s steady momentum is fueled by the energy it’s provided by fans, friends and kinfolk alike. Earwig, which has been home to many an act looking to cut a standout record, buoys the group as a home base, the center of a network of support and song.
Suitcase, which released its breakout record, Lisabuela, in 2001, subsequently performed two coveted sessions on the famed radio station, KEXP, playing the Audioasis show with KEXP mainstay host, DJ John Richards, along with a one-hour set on The Live Room. The band also caught the attention of R.E.M. guitarist, Peter Buck, who praised the “really good” group in an interview with The Big Takeover (issue #43), saying, “Geez, I haven’t seen a band that was unheralded in a long time that I liked.”
In 2017, the group re-formed after an invitation to play the popular Emerald City music festival, Upstream. Original co-founders Don Farwell (owner of Earwig) and Ed Otto added Clint Hoyler on bass and Joe Patterson on drums. Together, they recorded a new record, Come Back. Full of introspective lyrics and honeycomb hooks, the album is set for a 2019 vinyl release. After playing prominent Emerald City stages like the Crocodile and the Tractor in the 90s and early 2000s, the band is back for more. Why? Because family is forever.

17479,58427,372086,US,Bad Religion,No Substance,1998,41.72,16,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Alternative Rock']","Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

After playing with experimental guitarist Gary Lucas in his band [a1263938], he released his first album Grace in 1994. Initial sales were slow but the album quickly received critical acclaim and appreciation from other musicians (among them Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney). Just before recordings began for his second album which was to be called My Sweetheart The Drunk, Buckley drowned in the Wolf River in Memphis, Tennessee, aged 30.

After Buckley's death some of the demo recordings for his second album were released on Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk. Early session work recorded in February 1993 was officially released in 2016 and 2019, and several albums composed of live recordings have also been released, along with a DVD of a live performance in Chicago. Fun fact: before breaking through Jeff Buckley had worked for 6 years as a receptionist at Magic Hotel in Los Angeles, California, USA."

Seminal indie rock/electronic crossover group who originally met through David Stewart of [a=Eurythmics], whom Toni has known since she was a teenager.

However, they resolved their differences and formed Curve in 1991. 
Their first releases were very successful in the UK indie scene, but, despite critical acclaim, they never grew beyond that level. Low sales of their second album, ""Cuckoo"", led to the group splitting for four years, with Toni and Dean working with others. They reformed in '96 and released ""Come Clean"" the following year, the singles from which made a bigger splash in the US than their earlier material. However, the momentum didn't continue and label difficulties caused them serious problems.
Further releases failed to attract much interest outside of their core fanbase and, following the release of a two-disc retrospective in 2004, Toni called it a day on 31 January 2005, saying that the group had ""come to its natural end with a lot of good work achieved in the last 15 years."" "

The band recorded three albums between 1997 and 2001. The first two, Lovely and Lost on You, were released on the now-defunct Sub•Lime Records. Their third album, aptly titled Three, was released by Northern Records. The first effort was produced by Christian alt/rock legend Steve Hindalong and was characterised by a rough, guitar-driven sound. For their second effort, production credits were diverse but significant with Jars of Clay's Dan Haseltine and Stephen Mason lending a hand as well as The Prayer Chain alumni Eric Campuzano and Wayne Everett. The result was a more approachable sound that was at once extraordinarily mellow and enormously engaging.

Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

Composer and songwriter was Emil Nikolaisen. In this group he gathered his two younger siblings Elvira and Ivar, as well as his friends David Siraj and Ingvild Ask. The basic compositions were acoustic with electrical elements. The music was described as alternative, experimental, with traces of jazz, bossa nova and English pop. Emil Nikolaisen later called it café pop. After the debut, they planned to go in a more electronic direction. Later changed name to Royal.

Royal was the continuation of the band Bouquet. In 1997, they were engaged by the Rock Church congregation in Copenhagen to play a number of concerts. They played several times at Skjærgårdsgospel.

The songs were described as sweet, good and dynamic. The press release said that Royal was a Sonic Youth / Smashing Pumpkins combination with beautiful melodies and hard-hitting rock. Elvira Nikolaisen's vocals were said to vary from dreamlike to furious amazon, reminiscent of Bjørk and Alanis Morisette. The lyrics were about the message of love between God and people, as well as the love people have for each other.

Royal was not afraid to go his own way. The stage performances were described as very good musically, as well as characterized by self-confidence and humor.

Royal released ""My Dear"" in 1998.

Fluf was started by singer/guitarist Otis ""O"" Barthoulameu and bassist Jonny Donhowe after the breakup of their prior band, [a=Olivelawn]. Barthoulameu had been Olivelawn's guitarist, and formed Fluf as a vehicle for his own songwriting (he would be the band's only constant member). He recruited drummer Miles Gillett, who had previously played in the Orange County bands [a=El Grupo Sexo] and Gherkin Raucous, but had since moved back to New Zealand where he was playing in [a=Salad Daze]. Gillette came back to southern California on a visit and jammed with Barthoulameu and Donhowe. Things clicked, so he came back again to record the band's debut album, which was released on local label Headhunter Records (distributed by Cargo Music) in three formats with three different titles: on compact disc as [i]Mangravy[/i], on cassette as [i]Shooting Putty At The Moon[/i], and on 10"" vinyl in a shortened version (with 6 tracks to the others' 12) titled [i]Wasting Seed[/i]. Gillette soon moved from New Zealand back to Irvine to continue playing with Fluf.

They released their second album in 1994, also on Cargo/Headhunter. It also had a different title for each format, being released as an LP with an added 7"" as [i]Whitey On The Moon[/i], on CD as [i]Home Improvements[/i], and on cassette as [i]Stocking The Lake With Brown Trout[/i]. Preferring the vinyl format, Fluf released a number of 7"" singles and EPs on independent labels; many of the tracks from these were compiled on 1995's [i]The Classic Years[/i]. That year they played the inaugural run of the Warped Tour, which they would repeat in 1996.

Donhowe left Fluf in 1996 and was replaced by Josh Higgins, and the band signed to major label MCA Records for 1997's [i]Waikiki[/i] album. Their time on MCA was short, and Gillette departed the band to move back to New Zealand. He was replaced by Francis Winfield for 1998's [i]Road Rage[/i], released on the Fat Wreck Chords subsidiary Honest Don's. This would be Fluf's last full length, though they released a few more EPs with different drummers: Dion Thurman, formerly of [a=Creedle], played on 2000's [i]I Know I'm Nobody[/i] (which included the entire [i]Waikiki[/i] album as an unlisted bonus); Jake Najor played on 2002's [i]2klb[/i]; and Brad Davis played on 2003's [i]Canary Training Record[/i], which was recorded by [a=Sean O'Donnell (2)].

By this time Barthoulameu had joined O'Donnell and Davis in their band [a=Reeve Oliver], and Fluf became inactive, though they reunited for occasional shows. Barthoulameu, Higgins, and Davis performed for the band's 20th anniversary at San Diego venue the Casbah in 2013, and the following year Barthoulameu, Higgins, and Gillette performed there for the venue's 25th anniversary. Higgins went on to a career in graphic design, while Barthoulameu remained active in other bands (including [a=The Makeup Sex], [a=Systems Officer], and [a=Harshmellow (2)]). Original bassist Jonny Donhowe died in 2020, and Barthoulameu died in 2023."

They were considered one of the pioneering forces in ""math rock"", although the members are said to despise that particular term.  The band's sound was dominated by the ""lead drumming"" of [a=Damon Che] and was noted for its odd-timed rhythms and intricate and complex guitar interplay.  Also of note was guitarist [a=Ian Williams]' guitar-playing, which relied heavily on a finger-tapping approach used for the rhythm playing (there are no solos in Don Caballero's music) and heavy use of a delay pedal.  Despite an appearance to the contrary, the group's songs are not improvised jams but are structured works.

The founding members of the group were Damon Che, bassist [a=Pat Morris], and guitarist [a=Mike Banfield], with Ian Williams joining as second guitarist a year later.  The group signed to [l=Touch And Go] in 1993 for their first LP, ""For Respect"" and remained with the label for 3 more full-length albums, a couple of singles, and one compilation.  Morris left the band after the release of ""For Respect"".  Several bassists rotated in and out of the group, with [a=Matt Jencik] appearing on the group's 2nd LP, ""Don Caballero 2"".  Morris returned for 1998's ""What Burns Never Returns"" but left the group for good after it's release.  He was replaced by [a=Eric Emm], who was a member of Williams' side-project, [a=Storm And Stress].  Mike Banfield left, too, after some touring for the record and was replaced by [a=Jon Fine].  By 2000's ""American Don"", the band was down to a trio.  The album was their last for Touch And Go.  The group split in 2001 following van accident while on tour, although increasing tension within the band, particularly between Che and Williams, contributed heavily to the break-up.

After the split, members wandered off into different groups.  In 2003, Che decided to revive the Don Caballero name.  Although he invited both Mike Banfield and Pat Morris back into the group, he vowed never to work with Ian Williams again.  Banfield and Morris both declined, and Che instead regrouped with members of Creta Bourzia, also from Pittsburgh.  The band signed to [l=Relapse Records] and issued ""World Class Listening Problem"" 2006. ""Punkgasm"" followed in 2008. The band finally came to an end in 2009. "

Since the departure of bassist [a=Sasaki Hisashi] in 2004, Tatsuya proceeds playing solo with only a drum-kit as [a=Ruins Alone]. Formed in 1985, the group was intended to be a power trio; after a handful of rehearsals as a trio, the band abandoned the guitar and chose to move forward as a two-piece.

Ruins produce a unique fusion of punk and progressive/noise rock, with elements of jazz fusion, math rock and zeuhl, with all material composed and written in a score form by Tatsuya Yoshida. French band [a=Magma (6)] was one of the group's most important influence, such as Ruins' original lyrics were mainly written in an invented language similar to [i]Kobaïan[/i] language, invented by [a=Christian Vander] of Magma.

On their first recordings, Ruins teamed up with NYC experimental sax-icon [a=John Zorn], who would later release their albums on [l=Tzadik]. Ruins have collaborated with several other musicians, including prominent avant-garde figure [a=Derek Bailey], auteur guitarist/multi-instrumentalist [a=Keiji Haino] and Ground Zero alumnus [a=Kazuhisa Uchihashi]. They released a number of albums on [l=Shimmy Disc], [l=Skin Graft Records], [l=Sonore], Yoshida' own [l=Magaibutsu] and other prominent labels. Ruins have toured around the world numerous times, most notably as part of the [i]Japanese New Music Festival[/i].

After the last bassist a=Sasaki Hisashi] left the band, Yoshida went on a 'Bassist Wanter Tour' in 2005, performing his material solo with a task to recruit a new companion for the project. Since then, he decided to pursue a solo unit as [b][a=Ruins Alone][/b]. For instance, he was invited to perform at All Tomorrow's Parties 2010, curated by [a=Matt Groening]. He also performs as [a=Sax Ruins] with alto-saxophonist [a=Ono Ryoko].

Considered the Grandfathers of modern Dallas metal, the band accomplished many successes such as a nationally released album through Reality Records/Sony Entertainment and a music video that premiered on VH1. Although their fans rarely described them as ""metal"" the Dallas Observer awarded them best metal act several years running.

Most notable for the band was their live shows at famous Dallas venues like Trees and Curtain Club. These shows were described as energetic and polished. Several shows were accompanied by added extras such as a suspension artist who would swing above the band and crowd while suspended by meathooks through their flesh.

The history of devL begins in Paris with the advent of Surrealism in 1924. Thirteen years later, in 1937, Salvador Dali-who officially joined the Surrealists in 1929-paints L'invention des Montres (the Invention Of the Monsters), two years before his official break with the movement. 

Fast forward to 1997, when an angular power-punk band called Tin River Junction morphs into devL with the loss of drummer Arthur King. (He left the band to pursue a career in meditation.) Guitarist Action Housecat responds to the situation by calling Artie a ""dog-dick"" and purchasing a used Doctor Rhythm SixSixtySix drum machine to replace the former pulse instigator turned basket case. 

1998: During the groups first recording session as devL, at a place called the Space in Poughkeepsie NY, a burst of live percussion is needed on the end of the epic ""Conflation"" and a guy name Shaque ""bursts"" up from Brooklyn to lay it down, completing the first album, evldevldevldevldevldevldevldevldevld, an album otherwise pulsed by guitar, bass, Moog, machine, effects, feedback, and the constant ranting of co-producer Jacques Cohen. (Just kidding-it was me who did most of the ranting.) 

(Anyway, when it comes to Shaque, he was supposed to come up on the 7o'clock train, but didn't even make it up until 1am. He did two takes of the track, smoked a joint, ate a hamburger, then got back onto the train to Brooklyn, never to be seen again. As far as this writer knows, Shaque is now living in Flushing, studying eastern percussion & cuisine with the world renowned guru/cult-leader/kook Aza Raza Taza.) 

Some of this ""history"" is obviously embellished. ""History is written by the winners."" ""History is wrong and always has to be rewritten."" ""History is bunk."" You figure out what's what. 

devL's practice of darkjoy continues on the Jacques Cohen engineered Invention of Monsterts/ Deathray Sunshine double CD. PowerMad tracks like ""Killer"" (spy-rock meets break-beat meets Red-era King Crimson) and ""IOM"" (musical pyramid building in the Mayan block-temple style) are balanced-in the strict Blakean sense-with the beautiful and contemplative tracks ""We Are All Miraculous"" and ""Bounce"" (track 2-!check this one out first!). 

devL plans to go full circle and beyond with its next project (tentatively titled Live in Tin River Junction) and is currently seeking musicians to create a collective atmosphere, e.g., Godspeed You! Black Emperor; 70's King Crimson. Violin, vocals, piano/keyboards, drums and percussion, mettallophone (vibraphone with no motor), mellotron, mettallotron (not yet invented), stereo goathorns, theramin, bass viol, and sexaphone are desired.... But, as it is well known, the devL is a shape shifter and is always prepared to perform live in its duo or trio incarnation.

Slowly building their repertoire while touring the local club scene, the band (eventually rounded out by guitarist Louis Polito, bassist Clay Yeagley, and drummer G.J. Gosman) was eventually spotted by AC/DC singer Brian Johnson (himself a local resident), who was impressed enough to help them secure management and produce their independent debut, 1998's Seed. Containing a lackluster set of middle of the road heavy metal, the album failed to impress and it wasn't until the arrival of its hard-grooving follow-up, 1999's very impressive Living in Dog Years, that Neurotica truly found its sound and direction. Also produced by Johnson and featuring new bassist Migwell Przybyl, the album's diversified songwriting was light years removed from its modest predecessor and eventually earned the band a major-label deal with the W.W.E.'s Smackdown Records. Further lineup changes ensued, including the arrivals of new guitarist Chris Rollo and drummer Jason West and, interestingly, the band was then given a nu metal makeover prior to releasing 2002's Neurotica. Ironically, the bulk of the album simply offered updated versions of the sophomore disc's best cuts, with a few new tracks thrown in for good measure. The band then embarked on that year's ill-fated Ozzfest tour, which was marred by everything from last-minute cancellations (due to Sharon Osbourne's ongoing cancer treatment) to the tragic death of Drowning Pool singer Dave Williams."

Their music is a combination of rock, ambient, jazz, and many other styles, including influences from post-rock and post-punk. The band has released six albums since its inception, four in-studio and two live. Their most recent album entitled ""Live"" was released in December 2008.

Lake Trout consists of:
    * James Griffith, bass, guitar, vocals
    * Ed Harris, guitar, bass, vocals
    * Mike Lowry, drums
    * Matt Pierce, keyboards, saxophone, flute, vocals
    * Woody Ranere, lead vocals and guitar

Lake Trout first came together in 1994. Their first album is self-titled and consists of eight songs with a heavy dose of jazz. It was released independently in 1997. The band's second album, released in 1998, is also on SNS Records. Volume for the Rest of It consists of 16 tracks total and has a more developed feel.

Lake Trout's third album, Alone at Last - Live with DJ Who is a live album and was recorded on December 9, 1999 at Traxx in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was released by Phoenix Rising Records. This album, as would be expected with the addition of a DJ, has a much more electronic sound. It has a slightly darker feel than the previous two records and incorporates elements of drum and bass music into the sound.
With the release of their fourth album, Another One Lost (2003, released by Palm/RX Records), the band made a decided shift towards a more indie rock-oriented sound. The relationship between the ""new sound"" and the ""old sound"" is clearly evident, but the shift is obvious. Some fans lament this change in the band's sound, preferring the more jazz-oriented earlier work. Many enjoy the change, however, seeing a clear progression in the band's sound.

On September 13, 2005, the band released their most recent album, Not Them, You on Palm/RX Records. This album continues with the evolution of the ""new sound.""

In December 2008, the band released a live album containing songs from the groups live set that had not been previously recorded as well as select songs from the most recent two studio albums.

They were signed by Disney subsidiary Hollywood Records in 2000 for a two album contract worth $1 million.

The Pimps were promised no censorship and full creative control, but when they delivered the first of the two contracted albums, More Songs About Drugs With Curse Words, the suits at Disney balked at releasing it. The Pimps were dropped in 2001, but this major label tale has an oddly happy ending that allowed the Pimps to walk away from the label with $600,000 of their contract.

Beyond that the Pimps has other claims to fame, or at very least infamy, including having songs on major movie soundtracks for Mission Impossible 2 and Crazy Beautiful as well as having a song featured on the long running NBC drama Third Watch. Also noteworthy was the series of cease and desist letters from the Goodyear corporation that forced the band to change their name from the more imaginative and less misogynistic moniker of the Goodyear Pimps.

Despite their positive and negative brushes with the corporate world, the Pimps have remained independent. They spent their $600,000 payment from Hollywood Records to buy their own apartment building in Rockford that serves as living quarters for all the band members as well as housing the Pimps’ office and recording studio. They have achieved the noble goal of completely avoiding day jobs by investing their money wisely and keeping up a schedule of 160 shows a year during the entire decade mainly playing 2 or 3 day strings of weekend shows to fans throughout the Midwest."

1763412,0,7410572,US,Culture Bandits,Noise Is For Heroes,1998,47.8,13,['Album'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"Originally formed in 1990 by Haas, bassist Jason Bowes and drummer Terry Bradley (who went on to Thrall and Queen Bee, signed to Alternative Tentacles), the three Detroit Catholic Central High School mates fused their respective backgrounds in punk, metal, & pop with technique to form a unique sound. Haas explains that, ""we tried to make the music as weird as possible, with all sorts of time changes..."" but what could have been limited self-indulgence captured a loyal following. After their first show at the Token Lounge (now the Mosquito Club) they rapidly progressed to opening for national acts as varied as the Vandals, Jawbox, Big Drill Car and the Doughboys. In 1990 they played the VFW hall in Ferndale with a punk band from California that had really junky equipment. As Bowes relates, ""That stupid Noodles guy came up and looked at our stuff and said, 'You guys have some pretty nice gear.'"" Since the Bandits had booked a later show the same night at the legendary Finney's Pub they couldn't stay around to watch the set performed by the Offspring. (What ever happened to those guys?) 

Another break for the band that same year was being a finalist in the national Snickers New Music search which saw them being including on a compilation (on vinyl!) distributed to college radio nationwide. Also sharing space on the comp was a band from South Carolina who went on to be the ultimate winners of the search. If anyone has information about the whereabouts of Hootie and the Blowfish, please contact us here at musiczine. 

The Bandits carried on until 1992, when internal tensions between Haas/Bowes and Bradley split the act up. After some casting about, Haas and Bowes hooked up with a band that had just lost half it's members due to career relocations. 

Returned to their duo status, they sought to reform what they had started from. With the addition of Icewater Fountain refugee Eric Klisz on drums and Fayetteville, North Carolina native Derek Cooke on rhythm guitar (and ""chick magnet"") they played one show under the moniker of Rocket Sled before rechristening the quartet, Culture Bandits. 

To understand the Bandits sound, you should take a look at the influences that each individual bring to the mix. Lead guitarist Haas learned to play guitar by playing along with Black Sabbath records. Other influential bands were Black Flag (his daughter, Kira Star, is named for the band's bassist), Painted Willie, Dag Nasty and he feels he was most influenced by Brian Baker (Minor Threat, Meatmen, Dag Nasty). 

The Culture Bandits broke up in 2000, but the members are still playing music in various bands. Bassist-Jason in the band Brooklawn, guitarists, Ken and Derrick in the All Star Has Beens and drummer-Eric in The Ruiners."

Their mission was to share the message of Jesus Christ with a dying world, as well as provide edifying Christian music to believers as a godly alternative. For the saved they want to motivate them to deepen their relationship with the Lord. For the unsaved they want to challenge them to have a relationship with Jesus. Overall, Third/Crow wants to show people how awesome it is to be a Christian. With this purpose in mind, they began the long arduous process of filling the band lineup with like-minded men of God. That process was complete in May of 1997 and the original five-piece band known as Third/Crow began its ministry. After a reorganization of members in 2000, and a shift in musical direction the band is once again moving forward to share a positive message with the world.

The Name
The name THIRD/CROW references Peter’s three denials of Jesus. In MATTHEW 26:34 KJV: Jesus said, “…before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” After these denials Jesus restored Peter. He went on to do a mighty work for God as a pillar of the early church. From a broader perspective our name, Third/Crow, symbolizes the redemptive work done on the cross by Jesus. No matter what a person has done to deny God in their life time, Jesus is willing to give a “THIRD/CROW” wake up call that he is Lord and redeem them from their sins."

834279,0,6906168,US,Earth To Andy,Simple Machine,1998,48.55,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"From Charlottesville, VA. Earth to Andy is comprised of Andy Walbeck (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; vocals, guitar), Chris Reardon (Northern Virginia, USA; bass, vocals), Tony Lopacinski (Fairfax, VA, USA; guitar, vocals), and Kevin Murphy (Charlottesville, Virginia, USA; drums, vocals). Walbeck and Murphy first got together in the punk/funk band, Egypt. In 1996, Andy began to feel musically restricted by Egypt's style and began to seek new creative directions. He found it in local rivals, Reardon and Lopacinski, bass player and front man for the more melodic Red Henry. Although both bands had indie deals and loyal local followings, it was time for a change. 

Soon, Earth to Andy was cranking out a new sound comprised of muscular guitar rhythms formed with tight harmonic melodies. Comparisons quickly likened them to Stone Temple Pilots. However, the group's musical signature, growling guitars combined with group vocals, separated Earth to Andy from the typical hard rock sound. Their sound caught the attention of Giant Record's Jeff Aldrich, who signed the band after seeing them perform for the first time. After working in the studio with the technical command of Nick Launay (Semisonic, Silver Chair, Talking Heads) and the mixing of Chris Lord-Alge (Everclear, Fastball, Hole), Earth to Andy debuted in September, 1999 with Chronicle Kings. Their single ""Still After You"" (featuring STP's Robert Deleo) made its mark in radio rotations with its aggressive energy and power. Tracks like the sitar-laced brew ""Biting At My Heels"" to the full-frontal assault of ""Pollute"" and the guitar-driven punch of ""Sometimes"" should soon follow. This band is young and their future is bright. Currently they tour with the likes of Tonic, Vertical Horizon, and most recently Stone Temple Pilots.

Equal parts hard rock, heavy metal and Southern rock, Jackyl formed in 1991 and brought back rock 'n' roll back -- back to its down-to-earth, wild, fun-loving origins. Full of spit and swagger -- and a ""dirty"" sense of humor to boot -- Jackyl quickly earned a deal with Geffen Records. Jackyl's live shows were already legendary before the ink dried on the Geffen contract.
The 1992 self-titled debut album went platinum and featured notable rock radio hits like ""Down On Me,"" ""When Will It Rain,"" ""I Stand Alone"" and, most notably, ""The Lumberjack,"" during which vocalist Jesse James Dupree performed a chain-saw solo. Dupree's chain-saw escapades on album and in concert became one of many Jackyl trademarks. With the release of 'Jackyl' hit the road and barely left it since. Just long enough to record new albums.
The band earned two Guinness Book of World Records citations and the designation ""The Hardest Working Band in Rock 'N' Roll"" for performing 100 shows in 50 days as well as 21 shows in 24 hours. Dupree says the most grueling of the two was 21 shows in 24 hours; Jackyl completed that task in Texas, and the shows were all done with full lights and sound. The daytime sets were 45 minutes long whereas the ones done at nighttime were between 90 and 120 minutes long. "
389781,410754,1106339,Europe,Vixen (2),Tangerine,1998,49.83,13,['Album'],['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"Vixen was formed in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1971, by guitarist Jan Kuehnemund while still at Como Park High School. They were the first all female rock band from the Twin Cities.. In 1984, an early version of the band with Kuehnemund, singer Janet Gardner and bassist Pia Maiocco (who later married guitarist Steve Vai) appeared in the movie Hardbodies, as the on-screen band Diaper Rash. In 1985, the band moved to Los Angeles, California to be part of the L.A. rock scene.

Lineup changes happened during the following years until the ""classic lineup"" of Janet Gardner (b. Janet Patricia Gardner on March 17, 1962 in Juneau, Alaska, USA) - lead vocals, rhythm guitar, Jan Kuehnemund (b. Janice Lynn ""Jan"" Kuehnemund, November 18, 1953 – October 10, 2013) - lead guitar, background vocals, Share Pedersen (b. Sharon June Howe on March 21, 1963 in Glencoe, Minnesota) - bass, background vocals, and Roxy Petrucci (b. Roxy Dora Petrucci on March 17, 1960 in Rochester, Michigan) - drums, background vocals, was formed. This lineup of Vixen was interviewed in 1987 along with many other rock artists of the day by Penelope Spheeris for her film The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years.

In 1988 the band was signed to EMI, and they began recording their debut album. Vixen spent the next year touring the world, supporting acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions, and Bon Jovi, as well as headlining their own shows. The band returned to the studio in late 1989/early 1990 to record their follow-up album, Rev It Up, which was released in July 1990. A year of touring followed, including headlining their own shows and supporting acts such as KISS and Deep Purple. In mid-1991, the group disbanded due to musical differences.

Various members of the band attempted reunions throughout the 1990s and 2000s.  As of February 2022, Roxy Petrucci is the only member of the ""classic"" line-up still performing under the Vixen banner.

They began as [i]The Mob[/i] during 1981, formed by guitarist [a=Michael Wilton], drummer [a=Scott Rockenfield], guitarist [a=Chris DeGarmo] and bassist [a=Eddie Jackson]. Without a singer, they recruited [a=Geoff Tate] to sing for them at a local rock festival. At the time, Tate was in another band called [i]Babylon[/i].  After [i]Babylon[/i] broke up, Tate performed a few shows with [i]The Mob[/i], but left the group. In 1981, [i]The Mob[/i] put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape. Once again they asked Tate, who was in another band [a=Myth (10)], to do the vocals and they recorded four songs “Queen of the Reich”, “Nightrider”, “Blinded”, and “The Lady Wore Black”.

Since the name “[i]The Mob[/i]” was not available, they decided to name the band [i]Queensrÿche[/i] after the first song on their demo tape, “Queen of the Reich”. In 1983, [i]Queensrÿche[/i] released their demo tape as a self-titled EP ""[i][m=70727][/i]"". Tate agreed to leave [i]Myth[/i] and become [i]Queensrÿche[/i]’s permanent lead singer.

In 1997, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons. Over the years, his replacements have been [a=Kelly Gray], [a=Mike Stone (5)], and [a=Parker Lundgren], respectively.

In a band meeting on April 12th 2012, which Tate did not attend, the band members discussed outsourcing the fanclub and merchandising, resulting in the firing of Tate’s stepdaughter, Miranda, from running the band’s fan club. Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson also fired the band manager, [a=Susan Tate], because of ongoing “arguments and division” over decisions and “feelings that Susan Tate was not working on the behalf of the band as a whole.” On April 14th 2012, before the soundcheck for a show at the HSBC Arena in São Paulo, Brazil, Tate inquired with Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson why they had fired his wife and stepdaughter, and the other band members asked Tate questions about the deal with [i]Zoetifex Studios[/i]. Following that São Paulo incident, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with [a=Crimson Glory] singer [a=Todd La Torre].

On June 12th 2012, Tate and his wife filed a lawsuit in a Seattle court against his former bandmates, claiming that he was illegally fired from the band. They also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent both the plaintiffs and the defendants from using the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] name. On July 13th 2012 the Washington state superior court defeated this motion, as well as a motion for a preliminary summary judgment filed by the defendants. The court ruled that both parties may use the brand [i]Queensrÿche[/i] until the next court date. As a result of the judge’s preliminary verdict, there were two versions of [i]Queensrÿche[/i] for two years.

Geoff Tate fronted version of [a=Queensrÿche (2)] released their album '[m=567309]' on April 23rd 2013.
Meanwhile the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] line-up comprised of Todd La Torre, Michael Wilton, Parker Lundgren, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield released their new self-titled album '[m=568285]' on June 24th 2013.

The pair broke away to form Sweetshop, later shortened to just Sweet, with Steve Norman Priest (b. 23 February 1950, Hayes, Middlesex) on bass and [a5543814] on guitar. After releasing four unsuccessful singles on Fontana and EMI, Torpey was replaced by first [a2579185], and then Mick by Andrew David Scott (b. 30 June 1949, Wrexham, Wales) and the new line-up signed to RCA. The band were introduced to the writing partnership of Chinn and Chapman, who were to provide the band with a string of hit singles.However, the band were writing their own hard-rock numbers on the b-sides of these hits. The group's determinedly effete, glam-rock image was reinforced by a succession of Top 10 hits.

The Sweet in 1974 recorded the album Sweet Fanny Adams without the assistance of Chinn and Chapman. The album charted at number 27, but disappeared again after just two weeks. As The Sweet became more of an albums band, the hit singles began to dry up. Following a move to Polydor, they cut four albums with each release making less impact than its predecessor.

Since 1982, various incarnations of the band have appeared from time to time, with up to two of the original members in any one line-up. In 1992 two versions of the band - [a=Andy Scott's Sweet] & [A=Brian Connolly Sweet] - began regularly touring and gigging. In 1997, Brian Connolly died in hospital from a muscular disorder.

Lead singer Pat Briggs, with outrageous costumes and antics, paved the way for the mainstream acceptance of androgynous musicians in bands like Orgy and Placebo. Psychotica's fame reached its pinnacle of popularity in 1996, as a result of being on the bill at Lollapalooza with Soundgarden, Ramones, Screaming Trees and Metallica. Shortly after the tour was finished Briggs moved to Los Angeles, he and Kostabi went in very different directions and eventually Psychotica was no more.

In the fall of 2008 Pat Briggs and Ena Kostabi, along with Enrique Tiru Velez, reunited and began working on the fourth Psychotica album.

He is an American musician and songwriter, best known as one of the founding members, long time guitar player and primary songwriters for the 1970s progressive rock band [a=Kansas (2)], whose biggest hits were [m56469] and [m56479]. In 1980, the ever introspective, soul-searching believer Kerry Livgren became a born again Christian. In 1983, after inner turmoil and dissatisfaction within the band with the way Livgren's lyrics were going, he decided himself to leave Kansas after [m217535] to pursue a solo career.

In the mid-80's, he formed the Christian Contemporary Group [a2106419], and after their breakup continued to record solo albums. In 2009, he appeared on [m868218], [a1192110]'s 3rd album, together with former Kansas singer [a579827] and his brother [a740883]. He also appears as a backing vocalist on many Christian artists' albums.

On September 1, 2009, Livgren had a stroke. His family established the Kansas band website as the only authorized source for information on Livgren's recovery. He made his first post-stroke appearance with Kansas on January 28, 2011, when he conducted the Kansas State University Symphony Orchestra for 'Dust in the Wind' during a special concert celebrating the 150th anniversary of the state of Kansas. Livgren was greeted with a prolonged standing ovation.

Though Livgren is known for his music, he is quick to point out that it is only one of his many pursuits. On his website, he quotes his biography: ""I'm a family man, I have a role in my church, I'm running a record label, a studio, a production company, a farm, and I have more hobbies and interests than there are hours in the day."""

After a couple lame guitar players Rik pulled in long time friend Jason Coda on rhythm and he brought in Todd Shiroma on lead, he also brought in Chris Cunningham on drums The first line up was born. Later, Ivan X joined the band around 1995 after Jason and Todd spun out in a drugged out abyss, Chris moved up to Humble to be a hippy if you can believe it, and Rik stalked Kevin Steger until he joined the band on drums, this line up would remain for years. Briefly Sharon Needles of Butt trumpet/Betty Blowtorch came in on rhythm guitar, and Jerry I cant remember his last name, also of Butt Trumpet played drums, there are some recordings around of that time, actually recordings exist from all the different fazes. Also Pat Butterworth of Shoegazor sat in on several recording for the first album and played several live shows in between Chris and Kevin, he was a great drummer. Drugs were rampid in the band and they were probably one of the most dysfunctional bands of all times but that's what made it exciting, any given night you didn't know what would happen, from on stage fights to full on comedy, to drugged out drama but they were always blisteringly intense live. You either Loved them fanatically or hated them with a passion, they were banned from many a club in their day. It was the time of Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Spam, 90's Butt rock and they hated it! it was right before the Green Day pop punk revival and they hated that too, nothing new about it, so they did their brutal take on punk but in the process went way beyond that label and for those that got it, they didn't forget it. They quickly gained ground in the Los Angeles area played with a lot of bands toured the U.S. twice, numerous west coast and south west tours and broke up right before they were scheduled to go on their first European tour, their last show was at the now long gone Al,s Bar on Halloween in 2000, that night they played with Dayglow Abortions. They recorded two albums, Faulty Parts (cannibal City Records) and Sweet Meat (Hello Records) both labels are no more and these Cd's are hard to find, they did one rare single Killer Tongue Attack on Last Resort records. Tongue played and toured with an extensive list of bands Raw Power, Agent Orange, The Dickies, Fear, DRI, Shoegazer, Crack, Dr. Know, The Adz, Barfeeders, SMD, AFU, Thretning Verse, The Casualties, At The Drive In, Los Mongos, 400 Blows, Oppressed Logic, U.S. Bombs, Shleprock, the Fixtures, What Happens Next, Ill repute, The Crowd, The Stains, Throwrag, Groovy Rednecks, Imperial Buttwizards, Green Jelly, Vandals, Lunachicks, Bad Acid Trip, Syphic, Texas Terri, Rosemarys Billygoat, Haunted Garage, The Voids and on and on, man too many to remember. It was a good time in the LA club scene with Al's bar still around and a local fave hang out. Many of these bands still play around and some have fallen. Dez Cadena of Black Flag fame and now The Misfits sang with Tongue live at a show in Hollyweird (check the pics out) he sang with Liz on Booze Cruisin off the second CD.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

They began as [i]The Mob[/i] during 1981, formed by guitarist [a=Michael Wilton], drummer [a=Scott Rockenfield], guitarist [a=Chris DeGarmo] and bassist [a=Eddie Jackson]. Without a singer, they recruited [a=Geoff Tate] to sing for them at a local rock festival. At the time, Tate was in another band called [i]Babylon[/i].  After [i]Babylon[/i] broke up, Tate performed a few shows with [i]The Mob[/i], but left the group. In 1981, [i]The Mob[/i] put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape. Once again they asked Tate, who was in another band [a=Myth (10)], to do the vocals and they recorded four songs “Queen of the Reich”, “Nightrider”, “Blinded”, and “The Lady Wore Black”.

Since the name “[i]The Mob[/i]” was not available, they decided to name the band [i]Queensrÿche[/i] after the first song on their demo tape, “Queen of the Reich”. In 1983, [i]Queensrÿche[/i] released their demo tape as a self-titled EP ""[i][m=70727][/i]"". Tate agreed to leave [i]Myth[/i] and become [i]Queensrÿche[/i]’s permanent lead singer.

In 1997, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons. Over the years, his replacements have been [a=Kelly Gray], [a=Mike Stone (5)], and [a=Parker Lundgren], respectively.

In a band meeting on April 12th 2012, which Tate did not attend, the band members discussed outsourcing the fanclub and merchandising, resulting in the firing of Tate’s stepdaughter, Miranda, from running the band’s fan club. Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson also fired the band manager, [a=Susan Tate], because of ongoing “arguments and division” over decisions and “feelings that Susan Tate was not working on the behalf of the band as a whole.” On April 14th 2012, before the soundcheck for a show at the HSBC Arena in São Paulo, Brazil, Tate inquired with Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson why they had fired his wife and stepdaughter, and the other band members asked Tate questions about the deal with [i]Zoetifex Studios[/i]. Following that São Paulo incident, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with [a=Crimson Glory] singer [a=Todd La Torre].

On June 12th 2012, Tate and his wife filed a lawsuit in a Seattle court against his former bandmates, claiming that he was illegally fired from the band. They also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent both the plaintiffs and the defendants from using the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] name. On July 13th 2012 the Washington state superior court defeated this motion, as well as a motion for a preliminary summary judgment filed by the defendants. The court ruled that both parties may use the brand [i]Queensrÿche[/i] until the next court date. As a result of the judge’s preliminary verdict, there were two versions of [i]Queensrÿche[/i] for two years.

Geoff Tate fronted version of [a=Queensrÿche (2)] released their album '[m=567309]' on April 23rd 2013.
Meanwhile the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] line-up comprised of Todd La Torre, Michael Wilton, Parker Lundgren, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield released their new self-titled album '[m=568285]' on June 24th 2013. 

It was revealed to the public on April 28th 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] trademark and that Tate received the rights to [a=Operation: Mindcrime]."

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

Ferrio and drummer Tom McCrum, who grew up in Dublin, Ireland, formed Tandy in the mid-'90s and the group released its self-titled debut shortly thereafter. Their fourth album, the Bloodroot Transcriptions, came out in 2001.

The outer level is composed of about 40 people who are members of one or more of these three groups: Fun Wearing Underwear, the Dorkestra and the Doofamily. These people are involved in a number of ways, some are dancers, choral singers, horns, orchestral instruments, visual artists (electro and organic). Each performance takes on a life of its own keeping its form nonetheless because the core group remains stable. There is a good deal of improvisation but also well orchestrated planned ideas and great songs of newness.

DORKESTRA
Sometimes dufus will play with a number of orchestral instruments including violin, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, saxophone, tuba, piano, flute, oboe, bassoon, percussion, etc.

DOOFAMILY
The Doofamily is made up of previous members of the band and others who are at times invited to be a part of the shows.

Singer/guitarist Chris Armes and bassist/backing vocalist Jered Herndon attended Poway High School together and played in the band [a=Openfast]. When that band broke up, they added classmate Eric Davis on drums and started Area 51. After recording a demo tape, Herndon left and was replaced by Greg Schneider, Davis switched to guitar, Rob Hunter joined on drums, and the band changed its name to Agent 51. They released their first album, [i]Red Alert[/i] (1998) on local label Alphabet Records. Wearing matching black suits onstage, they created a loose concept that they were rogue secret agents on the run from the government due to their knowledge of secrets related to extraterrestrial life.

Hunter left the band and was replaced by Mike Levinson. Agent 51's second album, [i]Just Keep Runnin'[/i], was released in 2000 on the band's own Suburban Hooligans Records. Its liner notes expanded on their secret agent concept by describing the band members as a rogue agents enhanced with super powers through extraterrestrial DNA and technology, fighting against a secret government organization called ""The Agency"". Schneider left and was replaced by Sean Scura (formerly of [a=The Classified] and [a=Pensive]), and Adeline Records re-released the album in 2001.

For their third album, [i]The Red & the Black[/i] (2003), on Surfdog Records, the band shifted in a hard rock direction and dropped the secret agent concept. Agent 51 broke up after this album. Davis and Levinson formed 51 Guns with drummer [a=Adam Rapps] (ex-[a=Pivit]), which later evolved into [a=Arm The Angels]. Levinson left this band and reunited with former Agent 51 bassist Greg Schneider in [a=The Megas]. Armes later formed [a=The Rattlesnake Aces].

Since 2005, Agent 51 has played occasional one-off reunion shows every few years. In 2012 the [i]Just Keep Runnin'[/i]-era lineup of Armes, Davis, Schneider, and Levinson released two new songs as the [i]Operation Panther E​.​P.[/i] Three new digital singles were released in 2023 and 2024: ""Tear It All Down"", ""Let Me Go"", and ""Mystifying""."

Singer/guitarist John Tran (stage name Johnee Trash/John E. Trash), singer/guitarist Ian ""Slur"" Cone, and drummer Bob ""Stress"" Herco met while classmates at El Modena High School in Orange, and formed Home Grown shortly after graduating. Adding singer/bassist Adam ""Adumb"" Lohrbach (who had attended Estancia High School in nearby Costa Mesa), they released their debut 7"" EP [i]Smoking Is Cool[/i] in 1994 on Insta-Noise Records. Their first full-length album, [i]That's Business[/i], was released in 1995 on local label Liberation Records. It was given an overseas release in Europe and Sweden in 1996 by Burning Heart Records, who also released their EP [i]Wusappaning?![/i] the same year (a U.S. release of the EP came in 1998 on Cargo Music/Grilled Cheese). The band's early sound was heavily influenced by ska-punk, leading to their inclusion on a number of punk- and ska-themed compilations.

Home Grown signed to major label Outpost Recordings, who released their second album, [i]Act Your Age[/i] (1998). A new recording of the [i]That's Business[/i] song ""Surfer Girl"" was released as the album's single. Cone left the band after the album's release, and was replaced by Justin Poyser. That December, Herco had surgery to remove a brain tumor. He underwent rehabilitation, was able to tour, and played on the 1999 EP [i]EP Phone Home[/i], released on Fueled By Ramen. However, he did not play on Home Grown's 2000 split EP with [a=Limbeck] on Utility Records, titled [i]Connection[/i] (Tran played drums on one track, while Poyser played on the other two). He left the band that September, citing complications from his surgery. Darren Reynolds of [a=Longfellow] was recruited to fill in for a tour that began the following month. A few dates into the tour, Poyser quit the group over personal differences, reducing them to a trio. Reynolds' membership became permanent by early 2001, but Outpost Recordings folded, leaving the band without a recording contract.

In June 2001 Home Grown signed with Drive Thru Records, who released their 2002 album [i]Kings Of Pop[/i], which found them leaning fully into a pop punk sound. Shortly after its release, guitarist Dan Hammond (of This Camero) joined the band to play on that summer's Warped Tour, eventually becoming a full time member. [i]Kings Of Pop[/i] was supported by a single and music video for ""You're Not Alone"" and additional videos for ""Kiss Me, Diss Me"" and ""I Love You, Not"". The EP [i]When It All Comes Down[/i] followed in 2004, showing the band maturing musically and lyrically. Lohrbach left Home Grown in April 2005, going on to co-found [a=New Years Day]. Home Grown continued as a live act, bringing in bassist Ted Vega, but went on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Tran started a new band called Red Panda, while Reynolds started a band called Defender and Hammond joined [a=Paper Models]."

The name ""Craig's Brother"" was bassist Scott's calling name in school, where his older brother, Craig Hrapoff, was a popular jock. It was picked at whim for the sake of printing on flyers and stuck. 
Being christians, albeit not in their agenda, they were signed to christian label Tooth & Nail, but never managed to see eye to eye with the label's staff, philosophies and business models, repeatedly clashing over expenditures and offenses taken by the Family bookstore outlets over the band's lyrics and perceived image. In 1999, after achieving modest success with their major label debut ""Homecoming"" the year before, guitarists Andy & Adam both left the band and were replaced by Ryan Key and Dan McLintock. 
After touring for a while, Ryan went back home to Jacksonville and joined Yellowcard whereas Dan would stick around long enough to write and record their sophomore album ""Lost at Sea"" in 2000 before also returning to Jacksonville to rejoin his old band Inspection 12. Drummer and founder Heath left to get married, and HeyMike!'s Steven Neufield and Juice Cabrera also had brief stints in the group, making for future collaborations between these bands. 
Later in 2000, a photo on the band's website of then-drummer Juice flipping the camera off once again upset the Family outlet, and Craig's Brother was finally dropped from Tooth & Nail, their already finished new album remaining unreleased for over a year until it was finally printed and distributed scarcely in 2001. Without any promotion, sales were expectedly slow, and Craig's Brother soon disbanded as members kept dropping off to pursue other goals. 

Around christmas 2003, they announced they were reuniting, with the basic lineup that had stuck with the band for the longest time; Ted Bond, Scott Hrapoff and Heath Konkel. An EP was released through former Yellowcard-member Benjamin Harper's label Takeover Rock. At this point, the bandmember were all busy with their family lives and jobs, in and around the Santa Cruz area. As lead singer and songwriter Ted himself took up the role of rythm guitarist, they took their time and tried out a couple of candidates for the lead guitarist role until Glade Wilson joined the band in 2007. Work began on their third album, this time without the help of a record label but instead financing the entire project themselves through sales and their own funds, in collaboration with former guitarist and songwriter Andy Snyder. The album ""The Insidious Lie"" was finished and streamed for free on christmas day 2010, then released digitally in it's entirity in early 2011.

The band released its sixth full-length album, Delightfully Pleased, on August 10, 2010, on its own label, Modern Short Stories, and TDR Records.

1998-2002: early years

Punchline was formed in 1998 as a three-piece band consisting of Steve Soboslai (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Fafalios (bass guitar) PJ Caruso (drums). At the time, Fafalios was a senior in high school and Caruso and Soboslai were juniors. They played local shows and recorded their first album, How to Get Kicked Out of the Mall, a blend of pop- and ska-influenced punk. In later recordings, the ska influence became less prominent.

In 1999, the band self-produced and self-released the full-length Punchline album.

After being joined by Paul Menotiades (guitar, vocals), they recorded and co-produced Major Motion Picture with Billy Rossi for an August 2001 release. The four collaborated with Rossi again in 2002 on The Rewind EP. The EP's four tracks marked a transition into what became their signature pop-punk sound.
2003-2005: gaining popularity, Fueled by Ramen

In 2003, the band signed to Fueled by Ramen Records. The Rewind EP was remixed and remastered by Shelly Yakus for its Fueled by Ramen re-release. Early pressings included The Rewind Documentary DVD, a collection of footage of the band.

On the February 2004 album, Action, produced by Sean O'Keefe, Punchline set itself apart in the world of pop-punk music with bright three-part harmonies, unique melodies, catchy riffs and a strong rhythm section. Soboslai, Menotiades and Fafalios all sang on the disc and the first 10,000 pressings also included a DVD entitled The Action DVD.

During a tour, Menotiades left the band. The remaining members enlisted Greg Wood, a long-time friend, to fill in on guitar and vocals for the remaining shows. Wood, who also performed as a solo artist and was a member of the now defunct Connecticut band West Beverly, later joined as a permanent member, and played keyboards and piano in addition to guitar on Punchline's 2006 release 37 Everywhere.

In 2005, TDR Records (formerly known as To Define Records) released an Over It/Punchline split 7-inch vinyl with two exclusive songs. The Over It side has an acoustic version of ""Partner in Crime"", and the Punchline side has a previously unreleased acoustic version of ""Battlescars"".
2006: 37 Everywhere

37 Everywhere, produced by Shep Goodman and Kenny Gioia, was released by Fueled by Ramen Records on April 11, 2006. The album is dedicated to the life and times of John ""Beatz"" Holohan (1974–2005), the former drummer of Bayside.

The album's title refers to a theory suggesting that 37 is the most commonly seen number. The album's liner notes state: ""The number 37 is everywhere. It is in your daily routine and it will surprise you. Look for it and it will look for you."" Jason Sho Green, the artist/designer for the album, says the liner notes contain 37 instances of the number 37.

The album has guest vocals by Anthony Raneri of the New York band Bayside and Vinnie Caruana of I Am the Avalanche and formerly The Movie Life on ""Flashlight"", John Johansen of the defunct Stryder on ""Caller 10"", and Josh Bonner of the defunct Unsung Zeroes on ""Wars Will Always Happen"", as well as guest guitar work by Ryan Mendez of Yellowcard on ""Don't Try This at Home"".

On August 28, 2006, the band announced the departure of Wood.  Wood is said to be in good standing with the band and left to pursue other interests, specifically a solo career and teaching guitar.[4]

He was replaced by Jon Belan, a long-time Punchline friend and a former member of The Berlin Project and the lead singer of Gene the Werewolf. His first tour with Punchline was the ""Better Than Knowing Where You Are Tour"", headlined by Spitalfield, with support from Over It, Valencia, Peachcake and Boys Like Girls, in addition to Punchline.
2008: Just Say Yes and Modern Short Stories

Punchline's follow-up to 37 Everywhere was recorded in 2007 in two parts. Part 1 was recorded at Room Sound Studios in Tempe, Arizona, with the producer Jamie Woolford (formerly of The Stereo and now[when?] a member of the band Let Go). Part 2 was recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O'Keefe, who had produced Punchline's Action album.

On February 7, 2008, the band announced its departure from Fueled By Ramen in a brief statement:

    ""After many years on fueled by ramen its time for us to move on, after fulfilling the obligations of our contract with FBR we decided that we wanted to look for a new home. Armed with a new record that's already recorded we are excited to move on to something new. Thanks to the people at the FBR that supported us and helped us it means alot [sic]. onedoor [sic] closes and one opens.""

On July 11, 2008, Punchline created their independent label, Modern Short Stories, using the winnings ($25,000) from Heavy.com's Contraband Contest.

On ""37 day"" (March 7) 2008, Punchline announced in their AIM chatroom that the new album would be called Just Say Yes. It was released on September 16, 2008. A four-song bonus disc, Just Say Maybe, was included with the first 500 pre-ordered copies.
2009: more line-up changes and Night Lights

On January 25, 2009, Punchline announced the departure of its long-time drummer and original member Caruso. In a blog entry posted the same day, Soboslai told readers that the split was amicable and announced a temporary stand-in for already scheduled shows. He reassured fans that they planned on making music for a long time to come, and announced plans for a spring 2009 tour and DVD release, as well as a new album.

On May 3, 2009, Punchline premiered their new music video for ""Ghostie"" at 7:37 PM EST during an Absolutepunk.net chat.

On August 30, 2009, Punchline offered the new song ""Heart of Gold"" for free download, but those who paid $3 or more received 5 bonus songs, including rare Punchline tracks.

On September 12, 2009, during a hometown show in Pittsburgh on the AbsolutePunk.net Next Favorite Band Tour, Punchline asked the temporary drummer Pat Dee, formerly of the band Victory Lane, to become a permanent member. Punchline announced the departure of Belan later that week. Menotiades returned to replace Belan for the fall 2009 US tour and later rejoined the band.]

On December 1, 2009, Punchine released a digital collection of unreleased songs called Night Lights.
2010–2011: Delightfully Pleased

Beginning in May, Punchline went to Ohio to record with Jamie Woolford. Somewhere around this time, the former drummer, Dee, was let go from the band. Cory Muro, of Paul Menotiades' other band The Composure, also a Pittsburgh, PA band, is Pat's replacement.

A couple of weeks after their recording sessions were completed, Punchline released a song for fans of the television series Lost, a single rough mix track entitled ""Roller Coaster Smoke"". The track was released on the day of the Lost series finale. The official music video was released on July 23, 2010. It was directed by the Pittsburgh filmmaker and comedian Joe DeWitt.

On June 24, Punchline revealed that the new album would be called Delightfully Pleased and it would be released on August 10, by Modern Short Stories and TDR Records. The artwork was also released and the first song, ""21 Forever"", was released on their newly relaunched web site, PunchKids.com, on July 18. According to the band, this was their best album yet. Punchline's website allowed the downloading of Delightfully Pleased for any price. The name is refers to a crunkcore group, Brokencyde, that was involved in a fight with Muro at a show in Pittsburgh on April 25, 2011; Muro sustained minor injuries. Any money from the selling of these EPs was to gp towards Muro's hospital bills..
2012–present: So Nice to Meet You

On January 3, 2012, Punchline released a new EP exclusively on iTunes called So Nice To Meet You. The band had a social media push to get to No. 1 on the iTunes charts. On January 4, 2012, the album peaked at No. 7 on iTunes Overall charts and No. 1 in the Rock category. So Nice to Meet You also reached No. 4 on Billboard's Heatseekers charts, No. 29 Rock Albums, No. 16 Independent Albums and No. 23 Alternative Albums. Punchline appeared on the Fox reality television show Mobbed broadcast on April 1, 2012. Soboslai performed the Cheap Trick classic ""I Want You to Want Me"" with a flash mob for a long-distance friend Dana to profess his interest in a relationship"
253282,28828,1385871,US,Screeching Weasel,Television City Dream,1998,0.0,15,"['HDCD', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Punk'],"Punk rock band formed in 1986 in Prospect Hts, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

Throughout the years, this core line-up has remained the same, but with a ""revolving door"" line-up of bass players. 
The first was Greg Martin, who had to leave due to chemical burns on a large percentage of his body and subsequently falling into a coma. It wasn't until Jeff, the fifth bass player, that the band actually became active. Upon recruiting the sixth bassist, Kyle, the band saw it's first release, 1992's (me) a.k.a. ""Darby Was A Martyr"", a 6 song 7"" e.p. released on THD Records of Minneapolis, which got great reviews from Flipside, Jeff Bale, and Maximumrockandroll's Tim Yohannon. The band was then picked up by Recess records and released ""Get The Humans"", a 5 song 7"" e.p. followed by a split label release with THD, ""We're Not Punx... But We Play Them On T.V."", a 23 song L.P. which featured a cover of G.G. Allin's ""Don't Talk To Me"" in 1993. The bands first tours began shortly afterward. 
By 1995 the band began recording at Amphetamine Reptile studios for the material that would end up as 1995's ""Stuck on Stupid"" 10"" e.p. on Recess, and split 7""'s with Blanks 77, Resin Scraper, and the Rejects, as well as the song ""Sick Pleasure"" for Half-Mast/The Daggers Records compilation ""No Slow, All Go!"" featuring Twin Cities bands. The compilation was nominated for a Minnesota Music Award, as was the Quincy Punx in 1996. Around this time, the band was featured in Debasement Video Fanzine's ""When We Play For Real"", a documentary film by Patti Rhodes about the Twin Cities punk scene. A lengthy series of tours followed with bands such as F.Y.P., Sex Offenders, and Blanks 77, as well as short stints with Hickey, the Dwarves, Propaghandi, and a hand-full of others. 
By 1997, Kyle had left the band and Frank Rivera of Mpls. band Skaterbait, assumed the role of bass player. Frank was featured on the Quincy Punx V.M.L.ive 7"" recorded at the Fireside Bowl in Chicago. Frank left the band after the '97 U.S. tour and was replaced by Blake Hurlbert of (sic). In 1997, the band recorded the material for ""Nutso Smasho, with Tim Mac, (referred to in the liner notes as ""Dr. X"") the second full-length L.P. on Recess Records. 
From 1993 to '99, various songs were contributed to numerous compilations such as, ""Punk Bites 2"" C.D., ""Pigs Suck"" 2x7"", ""Stealing The Pocket"" L.P., Joey Vindictive Presents ""That Was Now, This Is Then"" C.D., ""Punk Sucks"" C.D., ""One Beer Short Of A Six Pack"" 7"", on numerous labels including Laberynth, Turkey Baster, Liberation, and V.M.L.
After Blake left the band, Troy Stark (Mondo Trasho, Slipshod) took the role of ninth bassist for the last stage of touring the band would see. By 1999 the band had all but self destructed, and for the last 10 tears, Quincy Punx have played mostly on their own turf no longer touring and only making special ""one-off"" appearances for one reason or another.

Sadly, in 2008, Frank Rivera passed away. 

In 2010, Mike produced ""My America! Tribute to the Quincy Punx to benefit the West Memphis Three"" a 28 song tribute C.D. on Crustacean Records featuring 27 bands, mostly from the Twin Cities covering the Quincy Punx, and featuring the first Quincy Punx song released in 12 years, a cover of the Vindictives' ""Get Lost"", the C.D., along with an accompanying 4 song 7"", being a fund raiser for the West Memphis Three Support/Legal Defense Fund."

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

A year later, they recorded and released the show as a farewell album.

BunnyBrains began its torturous life in 1988 as Bobby Bunny and Malcolm Tent's collaborative improv noise band and over the next decade grew into a collective of disenfranchised freak musicians from the state of Connecticut. The band's manifesto dictated that musician and non-musician alike were equally welcome and that no rules of sound or structure shall be required. 60+ members and half a dozen LPs and a dozen singles later, the Bunnies will be remembered for their contribution to communal brain damage and hearing loss amongst the denizens of the Nutmeg State.

The band continued for a few more years before splitting in 1990. Dave Grohl went on to find major success with [a=Nirvana] and the [a=Foo Fighters]. Pete Stahl has also performed with a number of bands, including [a=Wool (2)], [a=Goatsnake] and [a266773] and collaborated with [a218169] and [a283792]. He was also road manager for Foo Fighters and [a56168]. Franz Stahl was also a member of [a=Wool (2)] and, briefly, the Foo Fighters. Kent Stax played drums with Oi! band [a918644].

Scream has reunited for several reunion shows in the Washington, DC area over the years (with Stax in place of a very busy Grohl, although the latter has made some guest appearances)."

Jay Layafette, a member of the now defunct O.C. ska band called The Forces of Evil, played trumpet for them in their very last days of playing shows. Their singer, Jesse Wilder, fronted a power pop group known as Teen Heroes, and also played Saxophone and Keyboard for The Scholars. He and Scott Klopfenstein later collaborated on a number of projects, including The Littlest Man Band and PAL with Scholars bassist Jake Berry and drummer Greg Parkin.

Their only main release, an 8-song demo called I'm In A Band, can be found on their anthology Last Great Record of The 20th Century on Vegas Records, along with numerous live songs and goofy pre-studio tracks they recorded with a tape deck in their drummer Greg's garage. They were a hit at the local high school Los Alamitos High School, where they were also students. They opened and headlined shows with more unknown local acts such as Exit Smiling, Leonard's Lunchbox, The Nuckle Brothers, The Goodwin Club, Suburban Rhythm and others.

Scott, Jake, Jesse, and Greg later went on to form The Littlest Man Band along with Dan Regan of Reel Big Fish, and Suburban Legends singer Vince Walker."

The intense energy of Union’s live show was so fierce that it attracted the attention of Brett Gurewitz, owner of the Epitaph Records label, who turned up at one of their performances and persuaded the band to record a demo at his Westbeach Recorders studio in Hollywood. Gurewitz later played the demo for Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen of Rancid who liked it so much that they jumped on board to help produce the bands Epitaph debut East Los Presents (1997).

Up to date Union 13 has released four full length albums – three on Epitaph Records and one on Disaster Records. Union 13 improved their musical act through relentless touring with bands such as Voodoo Glow Skulls, Bouncing Souls, 7 Seconds, U.S. Bombs, Gutter Mouth  and H20 (on the first Punk O Rama tour), while also sharing the stage with Latin rock acts Molotov and Cafe Tacuba on the Watcha tour. 

Determined to keeping Union 13 moving forward longstanding band members Edward Escoto along with Baltazar Rodriguez have been joined by guitarist Eddie Carrasco and exciting new drummer Cassie Julie. The intensity created by the bands new set up has inspired Union 13 to once again begin writing new music. Moving forward Union 13 continues touring.

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

Many of their songs are about sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock & roll. Their musical style mixes hard rock, punk rock, Southern metal and psychobilly. Much of their music is not what would be considered traditionally ""radio friendly"", due to their frequent use of expletives and vulgar terminology. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to ""Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"" on the Double Live Gonzo album.

The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced ""Rider Sighs""), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) left after the album High as Hell, to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band C'mon) for the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some.

Playing in local Chicago punk clubs, the group self-released their debut album, ""Mo' Money, Mo' 40'z"". The band got their first real break when front man Tony Lovato sent the band's album to Goldfinger's John Feldmann who helped them get signed to Maverick Records, and produced their major-label debut, ""Wasting Time"", which was released in July 2000. Since then the band has released three more albums on Maverick —2001's ""Destination Unknown"", 2003's self-titled disc, and 2005's ""Photographs""—and toured the world as part of the Warped Tour.
Tensions between the band members about the musical direction of the band, growing up, starting a family and not wanting to tour as much caused the band to break-up in 2006, and Mest announced their breakup, as well as a farewell tour entitled ""So Long and Thanx for the Booze"".
After spending some time off, Lovato was inspired to start writing music again. He joined up with new guitarist Mike Longworthand new drummer Lil Rich Gonzales. The end result was a series of pop-punk songs that paid tribute to Mest's past, but pushed the band forward into the future. They released a new album, ""Not What You Expected"". Lovato asked Tom Denney from A Day To Remember to co-write a song with him. The track is ""Radio (Something To Believe)"" and is an ode to all the bands that the duo grew up listening to. Jeremy, from A Day To Remember, jumped in the studio to record a part for the song."

The group released 3 full length records, several 7"" singles & appeared on a few compilations. They released records for Grass Records/BMG, Merkin Records, Penultimate Records and many others. The band disbanded in September of 1996.

Fall of 1991, in the blue-collar city of Baltimore, David Koslowski had written and recorded some songs on a cheap ass tape recorder. He asked his roommate Colin Preston to buy a bass and form a band with him. Colin had never played an instrument before…it’s the classic punk rock story. The two would go onto generate a machine-like band known as Liquor Bike. The roommates posted a flyer in various record stores looking for another guitarist & drummer. After several failed auditions the band brought in guitarist, Stefan Meyers, who was a friend from the local watering hole and recruited Eric Dixon, a drummer and record store clerk. The first incarnation of the band was complete. The group quickly set up shows playing its first at The Jar, a loft space in Baltimore and their second show was in Boston the next weekend. They were driven and ready to hit the road and put out records as soon as possible.

In the summer of 1992, after putting out a critically-acclaimed 6-song demo cassette, Liquor Bike were asked to put out a 7” single on San Francisco’s Penultimate Records. The single was well received and the group hit the road again. While on the road, they were asked to do a couple songs for some other indie labels like Uprising and Third World Underground. They recorded some tracks with Candy Machine’s Tony French.

The band was then snagged up by local indie label, Merkin Records for the release of its first full-length. Before they hit the studio, Stefan was replaced by guitarist, Michael Gaitley. Eli Janney from Girls Against Boys jumped on board to produce 'Lowborne'. 'Lowborne' was a hard-hitting and in your face assault of punk-pop. Liquor Bike quickly hit the road to support the record, playing all over the East Coast and Midwest. 'Lowborne' gained the attention of CMJ, receiving a glowing review. At this point, the band started getting hit up by every major & indie label from Atlantic to Columbia to Grass Records. The group played a few showcases in NYC, some labels walked out with their ears bleeding from the volume, others ate their dinner while the band sang their hearts out, but one woman stuck around and actually talked to the band after a show at Under Acme in Manhattan. Camille Sciara from Grass Records, which was part of Dutch East India wanted to sign the band on the spot. The following Monday the contract was faxed over and the band had a record deal.

While touring to support 'Lowborne', they played a pinnacle show at 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis, which was attended by Creature Booking’s Dean Van Lith. Creature was the booking agency for L7, The Melvins, The Cows, Hammerhead, Helmet and many others. Dean loved the band and wanted to bring them into his stable. Liquor Bike agreed and signed on. Dean would work with the band until its demise. With a booking agent now in place, Liquor Bike began work on 'Neon Hoop Ride', their debut for Grass Records. They recorded with Drew Mazurek (Jawbox, Shudder To Think) at AmRep Recording Division in Minneapolis with the help of Tim Mac (Cows, Hammerhead, Helmet). 'Neon Hoop Ride' was more bombastic and pummels the listener over the head while continuing to build on the ever present pop hook. The band toured extensively in support of 'Neon Hoop Ride', even hitting the West Coast for the first time. Playing shows with The Cows, Iowa Beef Experience, Alice Donut, SNFU, Green Day and fIREHOSE.

The beginning of 1995 saw a tour with Hammerhead and then another with Killdozer & Casper Brotzman. The band was now ready to record its next record for Grass, but at this point the label had been sold to a multimillionaire who had ties to BMG. Therefore, the next record was set to be released on Grass/BMG. Grass Records would eventually morph into Wind-Up Records and sadly release music by Creed and Evanescence.

They decided to record at producer Drew Mazurek’s newly remodeled studio in Baltimore. 'The Beauty of Falling Apart', production was expansive and once again the band delivered some of its catchiest numbers. The group even started to experiment in the studio adding acoustic guitar and violin to tracks like “Old Fashioned,” 8 tracks of guitar to “Hi-Fi Sigh,” and David even sang falsetto through a fan on “Superface.” The end result was the band’s finest work. 'The Beauty of Falling Apart' was set to be released in May ‘96 and the band was hitting the road for 6 weeks in support. They toured the East Coast with Gas Huffer and then branched out on their own, travelling all through the Midwest and out to the West Coast again. It was in the Midwest that the band received heartbreaking news, at a truckstop David had called their manager to find out where their record was and why there weren’t any posters up at the clubs they were playing and was informed that their A&R person had been fired and they were dropping most of her bands, including Liquor Bike. Being the troopers that they were, Liquor Bike got back in the van and finished the next 4 weeks of the tour, sans their new record and tour support.

The next 5 months were trying months for Liquor Bike, they had just recorded their best record, had a great booking agent, but no label to put out the release. David and their manager spent the next several months talking with labels and sending out copies of the record, but to no avail. In July of 1996, guitarist Michael Gaitley decided to leave the band and return to the working world. The band played one final show with Michael. Eric, Colin and David wished him the best and began talks on how to fill his shoes. During this time, David made the crucial decision to end the band he had started with his roommate Colin. The band had unfortunately succumb to 'The Beauty of Falling Apart' in September, 1996.

In 2012, after 14 years of living in North Carolina, David Koslowski decided to return to Baltimore. Upon his arrival, he called up the guys and they got in a room and started banging out music together. On December 1st the band played a 20 year reunion show at Ottobar in Baltimore. In February 2013, Plastique Recording Co. will be releasing all of the Liquor Bike material in digital format."

Hate My Friends', which quickly gave rise to their popularity amongst the local music scene, which soon followed with their 1999 release 'The Things we Need' EP on the Touch & Go subsidiary Overcoat Recordings. 1999 also gave way to personal changes within the band; Jimmy LaValle temporarily replaced Robillard on drums, while Hoefer left the band permanently, to start a band with her fiance Chris Relyea, formerly of The Rapture, giving way for Ben White to assume the lead guitar role. By the turn of the century, the band went on various national tours, and brought drummer Jay Hough in place of Lavalle (so he could focus on his group The Album Leaf full-time). By this time, GoGoGo Airheart switched to Angel Hair/The VSS vocalist Sonny Kay's record label (GSL), and the band issued their 3rd album, ""Out Every Window The Snap Of Envy And Greed"", in 2000. 2001 saw the band tour the states and work on their next album ""EXITHEUXA"" which was released in June of 2002, when GoGoGo Airheart embarked on a national tour with Liars, and later in the year a European tour, supported by fellow indie rock artists such as Franz Ferdinand and The Futureheads, followed by another national tour on their way back to California with Get Hustle. In 2003 White left the band, and Robillard was invited back to double-drum with Jay, who ended up parting ways with the band in July 2003, stripping the band down to a 3 piece. In 2004 the band recorded demos of new material with Rocket From The Crypt/Pitchfork/Drive Like Jehu founder John Reis, but material from these sessions has yet to be released. By 2005, Ben White was back in the band and the group released their final album, Rats! Sing! Sing! which followed both national and international tours, and in early 2006, the band decided to call quits. Their final show was played at The Casbah on May 22nd, 2006. On their website, Andy Robillard told fans, ""after almost ten years of doing GGGAH we just can't keep living on the cheap ... I'm a little sad but also relieved that the band is done, end of an era and all that, but at least I can say without any reservations whatsoever that we never put out a shitty record, and we never sold out to The Man."""

The band played their first show on Mother's Day in 1993 and after a few lineup changes, were composed of Rubio Cisneros on drums, Mitch on bass, Tony Avitia on guitar, and Butch Klotz on vocals. Shortly after releasing their first demo, Mitch left the Houston area to get married. He was replaced by Jeff, before Rubio took over the bass role. Damon DeLaPaz filled in the drum position, and this lineup recording the self titled 1994 demo, along with the group's first EP, Elementary School Love, that same year. Ativia then left the group to start I-45 and after a few temporary guitarists, Chris LaForge of I-End Result picked up as their official guitarist. This lineup remained stable during their most active period in the mid to late 90s. Touring Houston, Dallas, and Austin, 30 Foot Fall's popularity grew; they would later become openers for larger bands such as Screeching Weasel and Sum-41 among others.

In 1995, on Fuzzgun Records, they released their first studio album Divided We Stand. In 1996 they also released their second EP, Junior High Sucked. After hearing a demo, Bob Becker of Fearless Records signed 30 Foot Fall to a record deal and in 1997 produced their next album Acme-143.

The band toured extensively alongside other notable bands such as Bigwig and Diesel Boy. They self released the EP Cartoons in 1998. Two of the three songs from Cartoons were included on their next album. At this time, DeLaPaz received a record deal offer with MCA Records for his other band Fenix*TX and moved to California. Brian Davis of Middlefinger was brought in to replace him.

In 1999, the band released their most successful album, Ever Revolving, Never Evolving, on Nitro Records. The release was followed by numerous shows including a tour with The Vandals.[2] Despite being at the height of their popularity, 30footFALL went on hiatus after the conclusion of their 1999 tour, citing the need to spend more time with family. Chris LaForge left the band at this time to seek other musical ventures. Jason Davis, brother of drummer Brian Davis) and formerly of Middlefinger, was brought on to play guitar when they resumed playing locally in spring of 2000. This line-up recorded The Doppler Effect in 2002. At this time, 30footFALL chose not to tour for the new album. Instead, the band chose to play occasional Houston/Dallas/Austin shows and their annual 30footFALL Christmas show at Fitzgerald's in Houston, TX. In 2003, with Chris LaForge back in the band, they released 10yearsandstillFALLING, a live album which documents their ten years as a band.

At their 2005 Christmas Show, Klotz announced that he would be moving to Virginia, ending his 12 years in the Houston punk scene.

On December 25, 2010, at their 16th annual Christmas Show, the band self-released their Jesus, Elvis, and Richard Petty EP, which was their first studio release since 2002's The Doppler Effect. In 2012, 30footFALL were featured in When We Ruled H-Town, which documents Houston punk bands and their rise to popularity in the 1990s.

Chris LaForge passed away on May 29th, 2017. He was replaced by Skeleton Dick guitarist Chris Vasquez. In October, 30footFALL released Champion Song, the final recording to feature LaForge on guitar.

Jason Davis left the band in 2023, returning 30footFALL to a four piece. The group released their first EP in 13 years, National Treasure...And Other LaForgeries in March 2024."

The initial idea was to perform covers of 80's hits, only with a punk rock edge. That idea was quickly abandoned when Doron began writing killer originals, mostly songs rejected by the Sore Losers. Keith Davies, bassist and founder of Clark's Ditch joined the band for exactly three practices before he was replaced by Mark Phalen-- Doron's roommate at the time. Davies is still bitter about the ousting, and takes every opportunity to remind us that he was the original bassist. Larry Hinkle, Doron's band mate in The Sore Losers, joined soon after, and the implacable line up for BEEF JERKY was formed.

The band recorded their first album, Can We Still Be Friends?, in 1998. They hit the road intermittently for the next two years, then Mark P. moved to Hawaii, Larry moved to California, leaving Doron and Noll as sole members. The band reformed in July 2002 to celebrate Hinkle's return from California, and for some reason they kept on practicing. In January 2003 Noll decided to buy a crapload of recording equipment, and BEEF JERKY-- predictably reenergized after the five-year hiatus-- began to record their second album, The Wind Cries Larry.

The Wind Cries Larry is a more collaborative effort between Doron and Noll than Can We Still Be Friends?. This is due to the way the band recorded the album, and also because Noll owned the equipment. He engineered the album (with Doron's help), so all criticism about the way it sounds should be heaped upon Phelan. The band recorded and mixed the whole shebang in their practice space at 911 Charles Street, a.k.a. Slobfarm Recording Studios. On its own the album has spawned Slobfarm Records. It is the first of many releases from various Slobfarm artists planned for the upcoming year."

A couple of songs that ended up on the early tracks compilation Quit While You're Ahead featured J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. on drums. After their debut, the Swingers dissolved for about a year, but then Hayden resurrected the group without Shore and Cafritz and with new members Bruce Bennett (the A-Bones) and Howie Pyro (D Generation) on board. That lineup undertook a U.K. tour in 1992 and released an EP, More Fast Numbers, which included the infamous song ""Courtney Love."" With the departure of guitarist Bennett and drummer Bert, Hayden soldiered on with various sidemen, releasing Decimation Blvd. in 1993 on Caroline Records. The album, the group's most fully realized effort, was 20-something minutes and 14 songs-worth of garage punk fury and hardcore flourishes."

Creeper started out as a recording project that incorporated Milkbone's hard hip-hop beats (mostly sampled loops with 808 kick drums), the heavy guitar riffs of Mike Clark, Mike Jensen's (a.k.a. Milkbone) vocals, and the guitar playing and vocals from long time friend Jimmie ""51"" Romero.

After making a 17 song demo in their home studio, Creeper put together the first Creeper record ""The Songs That Must Not Die..."" Creeper had also put together a complete live band with Michael Alvarado (Beowulf) on drums and Jason Benton on the bass. After playing locally with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, Cyco Miko, LIT, Alien Ant Farm, Sen Dog's SX-10, and many other local and known acts, Suicidal Tendencies started rehearsing and recording again, leaving Creeper without a guitarist. Soon after, Dave Nassie who replaced Adam Siegel in Infectious Grooves was the new guitar player for Creeper. Creeper played Los Angeles and Orange County for about another year before the band temporarily broke up due to personal issues.

Michael Alvarado and Mike Jensen decided to bring back Creeper with a fresh start. The new line up was Mike Jensen, Jason Benton on the bass guitar, Jose Nicholas on the keyboards, and Carl Burmiester on the guitar. The new Creeper was getting a bigger following, radio play, bigger and better shows and a hell of a lot tighter. The sound had changed from heavy guitar riffs and hip hop beats which they had been doing since 1994 to an unpredictable punk, rap, thrash, jazz, lounge, latin hardcore sound. In 1997 Creeper went in to the studio to record ""Lost Dog."" Creeper ""Lost Dog"" did relatively well worldwide and Creeper got offers from bigger labels.

Songs from ""The Song's That Must Not Die..."" can be found on Suicidal Tendencies compilation ""Friends and Family"" and ""Suicidal for Life"", but on the Australian version only. Songs from ""Lost Dog"" can be found on Infectious Grooves ""Borracho"" and ""Friends and Family 2."" In 2007 Creeper appeared on Louiche Mayorga's ""Welcome 2 Venice."" 

 Creeper is now in the studio with a new line up recording their third release ""Venice High Drop Out"" due out in 2013."

In reality, Mountain Bus had been using the name a few years before [a=Mountain] even formed. Guitarist Ed Mooney, vocalist Tom Jurkens, and drummer Steve Krater were all students at Loyola University in Chicago with their own individual bands in 1962. When Mooney's Moons and the Stars and Jurkens' Jurk & the Bushmen broke up in 1965, they hooked up in Rhythms Children, adding a couple of other musicians, one of whom was Krater. The band split in 1967 when one of its members fled for Canada to avoid the Vietnam draft. Mooney, Jurkens, and Krater found guitarist Bill Kees, and they formed Mountain Bus. The quartet stayed together until April of 1970 when Krater left for a two-week honeymoon. Lee Sims filled in for him, and when Krater returned, the band decided to keep both drummers. Mountain Bus played in and around Chicago from 1967 to 1971 while the members also held down full-time jobs. During the same period, some Chicago record store owners came up with the idea of starting an independent label to record local bands because they could release the music at a cheaper cost to the public without losing any profits. Good Records was formed, and they set out to record Mountain Bus in the spring of 1971. Their album, Sundance, was released, and sales started out slow before picking up steam. That came to a halt, however, in November of that year, when a temporary restraining order was issued by Windfall Music to Good Records and the band members in order to keep them from using ""Mountain"" as part of their name. Mountain Bus had never received much publicity outside the Chicago area, nor had they made any money to speak of with their album, so the lawsuit was likely an attack on Good Records because the label was trying to offer music at affordable prices, which was a threat to the profits of major labels. The lawsuit proved effective when Good Records went bankrupt trying to fight it, and Mountain Bus broke up as a result. [a=Leslie West] and [a=Felix Pappalardi] of [a=Mountain], when confronted with the charge that they had been part of this hostile legal action, insisted they knew nothing of nor did they condone the lawsuit, but the damage had already been done. ~ Stanton Swihart, All Music Guide"

Died: 04 October 1970, Los Angeles, California, USA.

[b]Joplin[/b] was the eldest of her siblings [a3565868] and [a3565870], and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where she began painting and listening to blues artists [a=Bessie Smith], [a=Leadbelly], [a=Big Mama Thornton] and [a=Odetta] with the other rebellious kids in her neighborhood. She graduated high school in 1960, and in 1962, she quit university in the middle of her studies. The university then ran the headline, ""She Dares To Be Different"" in the student newspaper.

She went to San Francisco in 1963, first living in North Beach and later, Haight-Ashbury, where she begun the drug and alcohol habits that would tragically end her life. During this period, she recorded a session with [a=Jorma Kaukonen] that later appeared as the bootleg ""The Typewriter Tape"". Noticeably suffering from her addictions, she returned to Port Arthur in May 1965 and 'straightened up' for a year, enrolling as a sociology major at Lamar University.

In 1966, at the invitation of [a=Chet Helms] whom she'd known as a teenager, she returned to California and was recruited as the singer for [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] in June, appearing at the [l=Avalon Ballroom] in San Francisco during her first public performance with them. In August 1966, the group signed with [l=Mainstream Records] and recorded an album. However, it was not released until a year later and in the meantime, with very little reward, they moved with the [a=Grateful Dead] to a house in Lagunitas, California. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drug use.

Joplin and the band signed with [a=Albert Grossman] in November 1967 and released [r559560] in 1968. This release was the culmination of a year in which Joplin had wowed audiences at the Monterey Pop Festival, the Anderson Theater in New York, the Wake For Martin Luther King Jr concert with [a=Jimi Hendrix] in New York and on TV's prime-time Dick Cavett Show. Joplin then left the band after a Family Dog benefit gig in December 1968 and formed a back-up group, the [a=Kozmic Blues Band], releasing an album in September 1969. The group disbanded three months later, with Joplin again suffering from her addictions.

After taking time out in Brazil with close friend Linda Gravenites (wife of Bay Area musician [a=Nick Gravenites] from 1962-1970), who was her costume designer and praised by Joplin in the May 1968 issue of Vogue, Joplin returned to America and formed the [a=Full Tilt Boogie Band], which began touring in May 1970. She also appeared in reunion concerts with [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] at this time. She then began recording a new album in September 1970 with producer [a=Paul A. Rothchild].

By Saturday, October 3rd Joplin had already laid down a number of takes at [l=Sunset Recording Studios] in LA, including ""Mercedes Benz"". On the following day she failed to appear and John Cooke, the road manager of Full Tilt Boogie Band, drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel where Joplin was staying. There he found her dead on the floor of her room, the result of a seizure caused by a heroin overdose.

Joplin was cremated and her ashes scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean. Her unfinished recordings were assembled and the result was the posthumously released [r755239] in 1971. It became the biggest selling album of her career.

Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 (Performer)."

After hundreds of live shows over a 7-8 year stretch, a much needed break by Jeff Dood and the Leslies in 2004 eventually evolved into an indefinite hiatus. Although Equipoise was their only official album, dozens of new songs were written and performed at shows in the years following it's release, but unfortunately never made it onto a subsequent album.

The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.

Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers.

Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist [a=Peter Gabriel], who left the band August 15, 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer [a=Phil Collins] who assumed lead vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist [a=Steve Hackett], two years later, saw the remaining three members (Phil Collins, keyboardist [a=Tony Banks] and bassist/guitarist [a=Mike Rutherford]) move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1996 Phil Collins left to concentrate on his solo work and other projects, leaving erstwhile bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks to forge ahead with new recruit; [a=Stiltskin] vocalist [a=Ray Wilson]. This line-up lasted for one album only (1997's [i]Calling All Stations[/i]) and Genesis soon found itself on hiatus after the poor performance and critical reaction of the new album.

In 2006 – after years of speculation – Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford reformed Genesis for the successful [i]Turn It On Again[/i] tour. A reunion involving ex-members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett remains much talked-about and unrealised.

Inducted into the [b]Rock & Roll Hall of Fame[/b] in 2010 (performer).

The original group comprised three core members: founder and bassist Louis ""Cork"" Marcheschi, guitarist David Blossom, and his wife, vocalist Nancy Blossom, augmented by Kim Kimsey (drums) and Larry Evans (guitar). Marcheschi & Blossom ""had been part of the Mills College Tape Music Center and had access to all of the innovations” devised by [a553689], but Marcheschi also built theremins, circuits and audio generators of his own - hence their unique sound.
In 1995, Marcheschi reformed the group for live performances in San Francisco, with a new set of musicians. These performances led to the release of the album Live & Unreleased, which was followed in 1997 by a new studio album, Sing Like Scaffold. On the latter album, Fifty Foot Hose essentially comprised Marcheschi, Walter Funk III, Reid Johnston, Lenny Bove, Elizabeth Perry, and Dean Cook. Funk and Johnston subsequently formed the avant-garde electronic band Kwisp, the first of whose two albums also featured Marcheschi.

Doug Sahm excelled in a wide range of genres throughout his career and influenced both the Texas and national music scenes. Sahm was a musical prodigy who, at an early age, began playing with a local band. He was singing on the radio at the age of five and was so gifted that he could play the fiddle, steel guitar, and mandolin by the time he was eight years old. Around this age, he appeared on the Louisiana Hayride, and before he was a teenager, Little Doug Sahm, as he was known, had played onstage with such greats as Hank Thompson, Faron Young, and Hank Williams. When he was thirteen he was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, but had to decline so he would not miss school. 

Sahm's career spanned over four decades and encompassed a variety of musical styles, including German polkas, blues, rock, and Tejano. In the 1950s he attended Sam Houston High School, San Antonio, where he formed several bands, including the Dell-Kings, Pharaohs, and Markays. In 1964 he helped found the Sir Douglas Quintet under the direction of producer Huey P. Meaux. This outlandish group of Texans, which included Sahm's friend Augie Meyers, dressed up and pretended to be part of the so-called ""British Invasion"" of the mid-1960s. Sahm wrote the quintet's 1965 smash hit, ""She's About a Mover,"" which made the Top 20 chart. 

In the 1970s he moved to Austin and became a member of the ""Cosmic Cowboy"" scene, along with Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker. He released his solo debut as [a509253] when he was signed by Atlantic Records in 1973. With help from his friends Flaco Jiménez, Bob Dylan, and Dr. John, Sahm released the album [m152060], which included the song ""Is Anybody Going to San Antone?"" 

In 1989 Sahm teamed up with Freddie Fender, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados. The group produced a soulful mix of country music, blues, ballad singing, Texas rock-and-roll, and conjunto. They were signed by Reprise Records in 1990 and released their first album, Texas Tornados, later that year.

Sahm was named Rolling Stone's 'Chicano Of The Year' in 1971."

Littleton emerged in 1985 as a member of the Annapolis, Maryland-based punk group the Hated; after their 1989 demise, he continued in a series of bands including Three Shades of Dirty, Choke, and Slack, which also featured future Tsunami frontwoman Jenny Toomey. Mitchell, meanwhile, began performing as one half of an acoustic duo with singer/songwriter (and fellow Brown University alum) Lisa Loeb. Both Mitchell and Littleton later played on Loeb's breakthrough hit ""Stay,"" which became a smash hit during the same year as Ida's debut.

Tales of Brave Ida After signing to Toomey's Simple Machines label, Ida introduced their sound in 1994 with Tales of Brave Ida, a luminous collection of languid, minimalist pop songs. Following the addition of Littleton's brother Michael (formerly of Baltimore's Hassassins) on drums, they returned in 1996 with the stunning I Know About You. The addition of Beekeeper bassist Karla Schickele preceded 1997's brilliant Ten Small Paces, and that same lineup resurfaced a year later with an EP, Losing True. While still a member of Ida, Dan Littleton also played in Liquorice with Toomey and His Name Is Alive's Trey Many; additionally, he and Mitchell were wed in late 1999, shortly after brother Michael's exit from the group. Following an ill-fated major label stay at Capitol, Ida finally released the full-length Will You Find Me on the Tiger Style imprint in the summer of 2000. A year later, the group returned with The Braille Night. The remix album Shhh.... was Ida's only full-length release until 2005, when Polyvinyl issued Heart Like a River. Three years later, the group released their seventh album, Lovers Prayers, as well as an intimate EP entitled My Fair, My Dark."

Vehicle Flips formed in Pittsburgh in 1994 when guitarist/vocalist Frank Boscoe formed the band with bassist Tim Parker, guitarist Erik Lipsky and drummer Tim Hoffman. 
Early on, the quartet shared stages with the Karl Hendricks Trio, Jonny Cohen's Love Machine, Crayon and The Softies. Jeff Schreckengost took over on guitar and Craig Whitman took over on drums later in 1994. 
Harriet Records released the band's debut in 1994, the Our Returning Champion single, as well as the band's first full-length CD, 1995's In Action. The band produced an impressive array of songs in 1995 and 1996, releasing singles on Harriet, Hemiola Records, Rover Records, and Numeric Records over the two year period. 
The group played 39 concerts over those two years, making it by far the most active period of the band's life. Boscoe's brother Paul Boscoe joined the group on vocals from 1995-1996. Drummer Tim Williams and multi-instrumentalist Eric Topolsky joined the group from 1996-1997, and guitarist Jesse Trbovich performed on guitar in 1996. 1998 saw the release of The Premise Unraveled on Portland, Oregon's Magic Marker Records. Kisswhistle's John Lancia was the group's last drummer, joining the group in 1998. The trio of Boscoe, Lancia and Parker briefly toured the Pacific Northwest in late 1998 to commemorate the release of The Premise Unraveled. 
The band's final full-length effort, For You I Pine, was released in early 2000. Vehicle Flips also appeared on various compilations during their tenure, including Harriet's The Long Secret in 1995 and the Friendly Society collection in 1998, March Records Pop American Style in 1995, as well as compilations on Sing Eunuchs, ZUM and Eighty North Records. 
The band called it quits soon after their performance at the 2000 CMJ festival. Boscoe went on to form The Gazetteers.

Upon signing to the Mud label, Sarge debuted that March with the excellent single ""Dear Josie, Love Robyn,"" resurfacing a few months later on a split single with Supporting Actress issued on Grand Theft Autumn. After recording their acclaimed 1996 debut Charcoal, Horvath quit the group and was replaced by drummer Chad Romanski, who signed on in time to cut the 1997 single ""Stall."" Sarge's breakthrough sophomore LP The Glass Intact appeared in 1998 and was recorded with second guitarist Pat Cramer, who quit the band a short time later. His replacement was Sue Roth; lineup changes continued to plague the group in the months which followed, however, and in late 1998 Switzky left Sarge as well, opening the door for ex-Castor bassist Derek Niedringhaus. The following year Elmore enrolled in Northwestern Law School, and in the wake of her semester finals opted to dissolve the band, playing the occasional performance as a solo act; Distant, a posthumous collection of Sarge demos and live tracks, followed in the spring of 2000.(All Music Guide)"

Instead of building on this success, however, Gates and Poulf tended to withdraw from the spotlight in the years that followed, with the exception of a few compilation contributions, preferring to make guest appearances. Rebecca Gates can be heard on albums by Elliott Smith and Ben Lee, while Scott Plouf helped out with Team Dresch and Beck.

Around 1996, the second Spinanes album was to be undertaken; however, Plouf had in the meantime received a request from Built to Spill to join them as a drummer, which complicated the work on the original duo. After the album, titled ""Strand,"" was released, Scott Plouf finally dropped out to become a full member of Built to Spill. Rebecca Gates then moved to Chicago, got involved in the music scene there and eventually found new fellow musicians for the Spinanes, which from 1997 also included bassist Joanna Bolme (later with Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, among others) and drummer Jerry Busher. In this line-up and under the direction of John McEntire (Tortoise) and with guest appearance of Sam Prekop (The Sea and Cake) the third and last Spinanes album ""Arches and Aisles"" was recorded in 1998. Gates kept the band active until 2000 and has been releasing solo since then. In the same year the rare collection ""Imp Years"" was released on the Superchunk label Merge Records.

The band had been planning on recording their first EP when Pete left, and the covers had been printed prior to the recording so he was credited on the first pressing despite not actually playing on the record. With Pete's departure, Chris stepped away from being the full-time lead singer and picked up the guitar.

Songwriter/vocalist Carla Bozulich and guitarist Nels Cline took a two-week trip through the Pacific Northwest and got an album out of it. Scarnella (1998, Smells Like Records), the name of both the group that Bozulich and Cline formed and the album that resulted from their partnership, was born on a trip that contained the beginnings of their work as a duo, four shows, six days of recording and mixing, and a whole lot of songwriting and improvising.

Bozulich and Cline had worked together before in the Geraldine Fibbers and both had stretched themselves in partnerships with other musicians: Bozulich in another band, Ethyl Meatplow, and Cline in the Nels Cline Trio, and in collaborations with Mike Watt, Thurston Moore, and Charlie Haden. However, both the unusual circumstances of the creation of this album and extra roles that each member had to play (Bozulich on bass and sampling keyboard, Cline on drums) meant that this was a project that existed on the edge of their previous experiences. The result was a sound that alternated between the ethereal space of the open road and the noisy organized chaos of random improvisation."

Harris on double bass and Bostek was replaced by Kenneth Ferry, Jr. on trumpet. The band was discovered by former Kid Rock manager Michael Rand. After booking the band nearly 60 concerts Michael began the process of introducing the band to several major record labels. Eventually Lava Records President Jason Flom came on board with Rand. The band was signed to Lava Records by A&R executives Rick Goetz and Jason Flom.

The Atomic Fireballs have released two albums: Birth of the Swerve, which was released independently in 1998, produced at Tanglewood Studio in Brookfield, IL, and Torch This Place, which was released on Atlantic Records in 1999. Though they are jump blues inspired, some listeners have placed them under the Swing Revival label. The band's biggest hit, ""Man with the Hex"", was included on the soundtracks of American Pie, Scooby Doo and The Haunted Mansion, was used in several TV shows, most notably Dawson's Creek, and was featured on both Dancing With the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance as a quickstep. Visuals of the band performing ""Swing Sweet Pussycat"" are shown in the closing credits of the 1999 film Three to Tango.

Bunkley was the former frontman for Ska band Gangster Fun.

Q-Sign was formed by American Chris McKay and Irishman Tom O'Gorman on the banks of the Oconee River in Athens, Georgia in March of 1995.
Soon after, the duo had added Andy Ainsworth on lead guitar to the permanent lineup and had begun work on the songs that would be included on Earth Loop And Goodness. In fact, ""Stay Away"", ""Pepper"" and ""Twist"" were put together within the first 24 hours that O'Gorman and McKay were writing together and the majority of the album's songs were written within the first 2 weeks.
Brian Pridemore and Ken Slotkowski were the original rhythm section. Eventually, Michael Rietveld took over on drums from Brian and first Dave Chalfant, then Christine Reynolds played bass.
Q-Sign played regionally for a couple of years and earned the distinction of being named one of Musician Magazine's Best Unsigned Bands In America before founder Tom O'Gorman moved overseas.
The band's last live performance was on July 4, 1998 in front of 55,000 people in Atlanta, Georgia during the Peachtree Road Race and Q-Sign was seen on nearly all TV news coverage.
