They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

Brought to London from New York by former Animals bassist [a=Chas Chandler], Hendrix quickly established himself as the brightest new star on the burgeoning progressive rock scene of the early '60s.

After a landmark appearance at the Monterey Pop festival, their debut album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Are-You-Experienced/master/24497]Are You Experienced[/url] was released in September 1967. The album, and its 1968 successors - [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Axis-Bold-As-Love/master/24511]Axis: Bold As Love[/url] and the seminal blues-oriented developments of [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Electric-Ladyland/master/24535]Electric Ladyland[/url] - earned Hendrix international acclaim as a premier rock instrumentalist and innovator of his generation. A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

The group was formed by art students in Liverpool in April 1977 out of an earlier band, known variously as 'Albert Dock' or 'Albert and the Cod Warriors', who had supported the Sex Pistols on one of their infamous early gigs the previous year.

The band originally consisted of Bob Bellis (drums, vocals); John (J.J.) Campbell (vocals); Martin Dempsey (bass guitar, vocals) (later replaced by first Ray ""Chopper"" Cooper, then Mick Shiner and finally Glyn Havard); Henry Priestman (vocals, keyboards); and Martin Watson (guitar, vocals).

They played their first show (as ‘Yachts’) at Eric's nightclub in Liverpool, supporting Elvis Costello. This led to a recording contract with Stiff Records, where they released one single, the witty and self-referential ""Suffice To Say"", written by Priestman and Campbell and produced by Will Birch. The band then signed to Radar Records and released two albums, a self-titled debut (released as S.O.S. in the US) and Yachts Without Radar. Following Radar's dissolution,the band released one final single (""A Fool Like You"") on Demon before splitting up in 1981. They also released a novelty single, ""Do The Chud"", as the Chuddy Nuddies."

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

144998.0,,22290895,UK,Black Sabbath,Live At Last...,1980,57.0,9,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"Considered by many to be the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath was formed in 1968 by [a=Tony Iommi], [a=Ozzy Osbourne], [a=Geezer Butler] and [a=Bill Ward] in Birmingham, UK.
The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Initially formed as a trio called ""Genesis,"" then ""Mammoth,"" in 1972 (Eddie on guitar and lead vocals, Alex on drums, Mark Stone on bass), and renamed ""Van Halen"" by David Lee Roth (ex-Red Ball Jets), who joined the band in 1973 after Mammoth had rented a PA system from him. Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

In 2019, further reunion plans were discussed, but the band ended upon the death of Eddie Van Halen on October 6, 2020.

During its first three years, the group was a progressive rock band with a somewhat fluid membership known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia. Most of the members in this early incarnation also played on Rundgren's solo albums of the period up to 1975. By 1976, the group was known simply as Utopia and was a stable quartet of Todd Rundgren, Kasim Sulton, Roger Powell and John ""Willie"" Wilcox. This version of the group gradually abandoned prog-rock for straightforward rock and pop.

In 1980, they had a top 40 hit with ""Set Me Free"". Though often thought of as a Rundgren-oriented project, all four members of Utopia wrote, sang, produced and performed on their albums; ""Set Me Free"", for example, was sung by Sulton. The group broke up in 1986, but reunited briefly in 1992. More recently, beginning in 2011 the earlier prog-rock incarnation known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia was revived for a series of live shows.

Ex-Grunties Melvyn Crawford (gtr) and Kerry Kirk (drums) originally wanted to audition Keine Namen’s Tim Naylor as a replacement singer when original vocalist - Tim Freeman (later of Frazier Chorus) - left due to ‘musical’ differences. Various hybrids of the Grunties and Keine Namen rehearsed over a few weeks around Xmas ’78 with the lineout stabilising around Melvyn who also took on vocal duties, Kerry on drums and Tim on bass and a bit of shouting. Keine Namen drummer Dave took on the manager’s mantle. Meanwhile, The Fastnets guitarist Jon Monks took on duties engineering the band’s sound and documenting various recordings, eventually joining the band as second guitarist.  

In January 1980 Controls debut EP on Stupid Rabbit Tapes was released - ‘Sock it to ‘em Dave’. Controls unwitting pioneering approach to releasing indie cassettes of their material got the band noticed and a short mention in Sounds resulted in around 500 sales of this 4 track cassette featuring ‘So Soon I Forget’, ‘Secrets’, ‘Nobodies Daughter’ and ‘Invited Few’, as well as numerous fanzine pieces and distribution offers.  A second release on the Stupid Rabbit Tapes, the 'Don't Adjust The Controls' album came out in the summer of 1980 and sold around 100 copies.  The band played numerous gigs including the punk, mod and new wave season at the Tumbledown Dick in Farnborough, a double-header with The Mental that degenerated in what the local newspaper later declared was 'The Crondall Village Hall Riot"" and a Beatle-esque performance on the roof of the cafeteria at Aldershot Lido's fiftieth anniversary event.

Personnel changes in the summer saw a different line up gigging in the Autumn and Winter of 1980 with Jim Rump on lead vocals and Mick Pendleton on lead guitar joining the Naylor/Kirk rhythm section.  This line up released the Late Night Love Songs album and was bootlegged on the Happy Sound of Eating live release tape.  The band also played a very well attended gig at The Wooden Bridge in Guildford.

Both line-ups of Controls appeared on X-Cassettes releases in 1981 - 'Anything Could Happen in the Next Half House' (X-002), 'Bits' (X-002) and 'Dance' (a Controls compilation)."

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

The band were introduced to the writing partnership of Chinn and Chapman, who were to provide the band with a string of hit singles.However, the band were writing their own hard-rock numbers on the b-sides of these hits. The group's determinedly effete, glam-rock image was reinforced by a succession of Top 10 hits.

The Sweet in 1974 recorded the album Sweet Fanny Adams without the assistance of Chinn and Chapman. The album charted at number 27, but disappeared again after just two weeks. As The Sweet became more of an albums band, the hit singles began to dry up. Following a move to Polydor, they cut four albums with each release making less impact than its predecessor.

Since 1982, various incarnations of the band have appeared from time to time, with up to two of the original members in any one line-up.

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

Passed away  August 6 2009 .Though starting out in San Francisco playing gay leatherbars as ""Billy de Sade and the Marquis"" (Billy being Billy Borsey, Willy DeVille's original name), the band changed its name To Mink DeVille (and Borsey became Willy DeVille) in 1975 and became one of the housebands in the famous NY club CBGB. CBGB was the epicenter of NY punk - and other house bands such as [a=Blondie], [a=Television] and [a=Talking Heads] got Mink DeVille categorized as part of the punk/new Wave underground to which they never belonged musically. Mink DeVille's music was built on R&B, blues and 60's classic pop blended with streetwise attitudes and back alley romanticism, not unlike the sound heard in early [a=Bruce Springsteen] songs like ""Rosalita"" and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" and heard from Springsteen confreres [a=Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes] and [a=Gary U.S. Bonds], with a twist of hispano, New Orleans and Zydeco. Discovered by [l=Capitol Records] in 1977 the band recorded three albums for the label. The fresh approach to R&B classicism and rock & roll got producer legend [a=Jack Nitzsche] interested in producing the band and he is credited as being a major influence on the development of the band's sound. Hearing the band live in its early days also caught song writing legend [a=Doc Pomus]'s attention, and he offered to write with Willy DeVille. In spite of critical acclaim and praise of DeVille's writing talent, Mink DeVille didn't make it big in the US, but caught quite an audience in Europe. 

The original Mink Deville band was broken up by Willy DeVille after the first two albums, and from 1980's ""Le Chat Bleu"" recorded in Paris, he would hand-pick musicians for recording and touring under the band name. The album is often cited as the band's best out of the six studio albums.

From 1986 Willy DeVille performed under his own name.

Key band songs include ""Spanish Stroll"", ""Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl"", ""A"" Train Lady, ""I Broke That Promise"", ""Just To Walk That Little Girl Home"" and ""Love & Emotion""

Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.

Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"". The Bouchard brothers also contributed lead vocals.  

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.  Lanier returned in 1987 and the band continued to tour, although they recorded very little.  2001's ""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"" was the band's last studio recording until 2020's ""The Symbol Remains.""

According to the Buzzcocks discography he does play on it, but it is believed that he did not participate on this single. By 1980, the band had almost run its course. With a few new members (Helen Barbrook, Trev Wain, and Dave Price) the band recorded and released its only full length album that was titled Final Vinyl. Released in January of 1980, the album featured some re-recordings of previous Teardrops songs ""Teardrops and Heartaches"", was now known as ""Everything's O.K"" it was originally a B-side on the Seeing Double single. ""Teenage Vice"" was also on this album, it was previously on the In and Out of Fashion EP and the Leave No Choice EP. The music on this album is for the most part experimental. There are elements of 70s Punk and New Wave on Final Vinyl, at times sounding like a mix between Buzzcocks and The Fall. The band essentially dissolved by 1981. In 1980 a compilation featuring Manchester bands called Identity Parade was released, it featured a song by The Teardrops called ""Colours"". A very short lived band emerged following The Teardrops called Bok Bok. They released one single in 1980 called Come Back To Me.

153073.0,,23696819,UK,Kiss,Unmasked Uk Promo,1980,39.52,11,"['LP', 'Album', 'Promo']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Pop Rock']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

The idea of the group came from Anthony Moore, an English experimental and avant-garde artist living in Germany, when he was under contract with Polydor for 3 albums. The first two, very experimental, didn't sell well, so when Polydor received the third one ([m=2147974]) which was basically a 40 minute recording of sticks falling on the floor, they freaked, and requested an album of more conventional, commercial songs. As an answer to this request, and as a joke, Anthony Moore teamed up with his mate Peter Blegvad to compose a very poppy song, which they did in 20 minutes, and recorded in less than 2 hours. But they weren't satisfied with their singing, so they persuaded Dagmar Krause (Anthony Moore's then girlfriend) to sing it. The song was [m=3245827], and to Moore's surprise, Polydor was very happy with this recording and decided to release it immediately as a single. They also requested a full length album : [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4495803-Slapp-Happy-Sort-Of]the first Slapp Happy LP[/url] was thus released by Polydor to fullfill Anthony Moore's contract for a 3rd album - and as a result, [m2147974] was shelved.

Still in Germany, Moore, Blegvad and Krause, backed by the band [a=Faust], recorded a second album in 1973, but Polydor had no more contractual obligation and declined to release it. 
The band members moved to England in 1974 where they signed with [l=Virgin], who agreed to release [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/1601931-Slapp-Happy-Slapp-Happy]the second album[/url] on the condition it would be re-recorded. Through the Virgin connection, Slapp Happy met [a=Henry Cow] with whom they merged in 1975. But the merger ended soon afterwards, Dagmar Krause stayed with Henry Cow and Slapp Happy split up.

There were several reunions afterwards. In 1982 the trio reunited briefly to record the [r=1601997] single. They also performed live (for the first time ever) during the ""Dial M For Music"" festival, held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts on 10 September 1982. The three collaborated again in 1991 on a specially commissioned television opera ""Camera"", produced by After Image for Channel 4, based on an original idea by Krause, with words by Blegvad and music by Moore. The soundtrack [m=611691] wasn't released until 2000, and not under the Slapp Happy name.

In 1997, Slapp Happy reunited again to record [m=37666]. Slapp Happy was popular in Japan and toured there in 2000, playing on stage without any backing musicians, and released [m=270692] to commemorate this tour. Krause, Moore and Blegvad then reformed Slapp Happy again in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on 10–11 February 2017 at Cafe Oto in London and on 24 February 2017. Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt. Rainer Hall, Shibuya in Tokyo. On 17 September 2017, Slapp Happy and Faust played at the 10th Rock in Opposition festival in Carmaux, France. On 28 September, they played as a trio in the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten (Art Academy) in Den Haag (The Hague). They made a final appearance in November 2017 in Brussels, Belgium."

Founder and Lead Vocalist Charlie Harper was playing in R&B and pub rock groups before being influenced by bands like The Damned to turn to punk. 

The band initially started in 1976 as ""The Subversives"" with singer Charlie Harper. When the band line-up was based around Harper's growling Cockney vocals with Nicky Garratt on Guitar, Paul Slack on Bass and a variety of drummers they became the ""U.K. subversives"", later shortened to ""U.K. Subs"". Although adopting punk stylings, the bands work was still heavily influenced by R&B, albeit played fast. Their sound was most similar to Sham 69 or The Angelic Upstarts, although without the skinhead following

Whilst never having a big hit, several singles made the lower reaches of the Top 30 in the late 70s,  including ""Stranglehold"", ""Tomorrow's Girls"", a cover of The Zombies classic ""She's Not There""  and ""Warhead"". The first two studio LPs ""Another Kind of Blues"" and ""Brand New Age"" also made the lower reaches of the album charts.

In 1983 Nicky Garratt left the band along with bass player Alvin Gibbs and then drummer Kim Wylie leaving Charlie Harper to recruit a whole new band.

Garratt would come back in and out of the line-up over the following 25 years whilst Charlie carried on touring and recording with an almost ever changing line-up.

The UK Subs are the only band to record an album for every letter of the alphabet, in order, reaching Z (Ziezo) in 2016."

The recording preserves the anarchic free spirit that surfaced from punk, but with art sound-scapes and experimental textures akin to Krautrock, mixed with an alternative funk dub.
For all these years the album has remained a firm favourite on the underground scene to the disaffected in the know-how.      

1981 saw the follow-up Intense Living with its collage cut-up cold graveyard cover, set against a New York skyline and songs innocently depicting mankind’s dark future. The experimental textures remain, but with a hefty wash of melody over the top. This was to be the last album Mex would release until the 21st century.
In the same year of ‘81, two immortal cuts Evil Creature and Functioning Fripp Girls appeared on the infamous Thing from the Crypt compilation album, re-released in February 2013 by Dark Entries Records.
Other isolated tracks also featured on various DIY compilations around that time and it was during this period Mex created the musical atmospheres for the surreal independent stage play, Dark of the Moon.

1983 saw Lost Moment Records release a Mex vinyl 7” containing a satirical 60s style infused song entitled Happy Life, coupled with the sinister acoustic b-side, Veins.

The malicious Don’t Go Looking for Love made its presence on the 1984 compilation album, Colours of the Bastard Art, also issued by Lost Moment Records.

To date and after two decades, Mex has been locked away with life’s disillusions and immersed in almost anonymous studio experimentation antics, only surfacing of late, whereby the 2014 album Dr Jekyll & Mrs Hyde, arrived."
124280.0,504216.0,2103439,UK,Kevin Coyne,Dandelion Years,1980,0.0,37,"['LP', 'Album', 'Compilation']",['Rock'],['Prog Rock'],"Singer, songwriter, guitarist, painter, poet and writer.
Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

Spearheading Blitz's ultra-chic clientele were Steve Strange and DJ Rusty Egan, one time drummer with the Rich Kids. Seeking to record music of their own to fit in with the club's regular playlist (a steady diet of David Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Roxy Music), Strange and Egan were offered studio time by another Rich Kids alum, guitarist Midge Ure. In late 1978, this trio recorded a demo which yielded the first Visage single, an aptly futuristic cover of Zager & Evans' ""In the Year 2525.""

Adding Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie as well as three members of Magazine -- bassist Barry Adamson, guitarist John McGeoch, and keyboardist Dave Formula -- Visage signed to Martin Rushent's Genetic Records to release ""Tar,"" in September of 1979, followed a year later by their self-titled debut LP. The album yielded a major single in ""Fade To Grey,"" an instant club classic which heralded synth-pop's imminent commercial breakthrough. The follow-up, ""Mind of a Toy,"" was a Top 20 hit. Next came their sophomore album, 1982's ""The Anvil."" Midge, John, Dave and Billy left in 1983.

By January 1977 the line-up was Malcolm Lane (guitar, synth, vocals), Simon Millward (bass, vocals, synth), Mark Rowlatt (drums, percussion) and Anton Loach, with Jacqueline Bailey dedicated to designing the band's record covers in a Suprematist style. Their sound honed on the repetitive minimalism featured in Post-punk and Krautrock, with tints in lo-fi Magma-esque passages sneaking their way in through pronounced bass lines. Within the UK press their sound was roughly lumped alongside several other UK experimentalists, The Pop Group, Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle and This Heat. While tied to many preconceived conceptions, “a poor man's This Heat” comes as a classic example; the group procured a different sound upon each release. Aside from British counterparts, the band also claimed continental influences from Can, Gong and Magma.

Early on, Metabolist came to the executive decision to steer clear of capital record labels, forming [l16724]. In their short career the band only released one full-length LP, with a scattering of 7” singles and cassettes on the side. Their lone album [r=200551] (1980) acts as their most complete recording. Each bandmember took an active responsibility in recording, mixing and editing; giving freedom to ideas, time, and money. Indicative of these procedures the band's sound is defined by a rougher edge. Unfortunately these independent actions have lead to restricted re-issue abilities, with original copies being sought-after items.

We did not take ourselves seriously, but we were serious about that. […] Like the Statue of Liberty we held up a shining torch of self-entertainment! Saying: Have fun! Play! Participate!

[l=Wire Magazine] included this album in their legendary [i]100 Records That Set the World On Fire[/i] list in Issue #175, published in Sep 1998.

One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer).

At the age of eleven, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dancing, then located in Holland Park, London, and two years later was starred to move on to the Royal Ballet School at White Lodge. However, she gave up ballet two years later, and achieved three A-Levels at Grade A. She studied classical piano to Grade 7. All her school years were spent at St Joseph's Convent School, Reading, where she became friends with Marianne Faithfull. Oldfield read English Literature and Philosophy at Bristol University.

Oldfield's musical career started in early 1968, when she made some demo recordings with her younger brother Mike Oldfield. These sessions were suggested and overseen by Mick Jagger. It is not known what became of those recordings.

Soon after this she founded the folk music duo The Sallyangie together with her brother Mike. The duo was signed to Transatlantic Records and recorded their only album at the recommendation of Pentangle band guitarist, John Renbourn, whom Oldfield met at the Troubadour Folk Club in Bristol. The album Children of the Sun was recorded in August 1968. The songs on it are mainly co-written by Sally and Mike Oldfield, and the album contained some of her brother's early guitar work. Guesting were Terry Cox on drums and Ray Warleigh on flute.

Evolving from Cleveland's Teutonic protopunks, [a252899], Pere Ubu was formed late in 1975 by Thomas (aka Crocus Behemoth) and guitarist Peter Laughner (who died in 1977). Ubu's classic early singles, ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""Final Solution,"" oozed restless angst way before it became the domain of spoiled mallrats. By 1978's aggressive The Modern Dance and the wilder Dub Housing, Pere Ubu's subversions of rock were guided by superior musicianship and fallout from Thomas's Jehovah's Witness upbringing. Personality quirks split the band, and Thomas regrouped for three more self-indulgent albums through 1982, including the abstract stare-down of The Art Of Walking, all with some difficult sonic perversion to recommend them.

After several Ubus found themselves onstage in Thomas's Wooden Birds, the band was revived for 1988's The Tenement Year. With newfound focus, Pere Ubu unleashed the ravishing funhouse pop experiment of 1989's Cloudland, which treated mainstream textures like found sounds. The sparkling pop, dented by Thomas's unique warble, continued with the gently peculiar Worlds In Collision. But Ubu tired of the total pop concept and returned to quirkier pursuits for Story Of My Life. Tim Kerr Records picked up the ball with 1995's full-bodied Ray Gun Suitcase--a mix of Ubu's vicious rock, luscious pop and art-damaged identities--and a series of multimedia-enhanced EPs, for which Thomas programmed the codes."

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

Excerpts from Wikipedia:
The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) is one of five permanent symphony orchestras based in London. It was founded by the conductors Sir Thomas Beecham and Malcolm Sargent in 1932 as a rival to the existing London Symphony and BBC Symphony Orchestras. The founders' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. 

Unlike its London rivals the RPO and the Philharmonia, the post-war LPO was not exclusively associated with one company, and as well as Decca it recorded for Philips, CBS, RCA, Chandos and many other labels. The orchestra has been associated with the Royal Festival Hall since its opening in 1951, and has been its Resident Orchestra since 1992. In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra was particularly associated with Lyrita, an independent company specialising in neglected British repertoire. In most LPO recordings for Lyrita the conductor was Boult; in the same period he also recorded extensively for EMI, with the LPO his preferred orchestra. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once, and consequently appeared under the name ""The Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra"" in some of its recordings."

Quincy was a New Wave/Power pop band from New Jersey. They released their first album on Columbia records in 1980 entitled ""Quincy"" and an EP in 1983 entitled ""Don't Say No"", using the band name [a1696916].

The band was started by two sets of brothers, Stephen and Brian Butler, and Gerald and Alex Takach. The brothers had met while going to Haddon Heights High School in New Jersey during the 1970s and eventually forming Quincy, where they started off with an acoustic/electric soft rock sound with 4 part vocal harmonies. In 1976, Quincy did a month long tour of the midwest with Bob Holden on drums. A few months later on Friday August 13, 1976, while playing at JC Dobbs club on South Street in Philadelphia, Alex Takach was mysteriously murdered.

After a short period of inactivity, the band re-emerged embracing the Punk/New Wave movement. Gerald Takach took the stage name Gerald Emerick and the band added Wally Smith (aka Metro) on keyboards. They found their way to CBGB in New York and became a regular fixture in the late 1970s. They were managed by the owner of CBGB, Hilly Kristal.

Quincy released a single on CBGB Records titled ""Can't Live In A Dream""/""Salvation Fantasy"". The band eventually signed with Columbia/CBS Records. The debut album was released to favorable reviews and enthusiasm at radio stations.

Shortly after the first album came out, Quincy Jones sued them for using his name. CBS Records did not help the band with the lawsuit. (Both the band and Jones recorded for CBS, and Jones was vastly more powerful than the band.) The band Quincy and Quincy Jones eventually settled out of court. The band then changed its name to [a1696916]. The settlement stipulated that no mention could be made of the lawsuit in public.

After a long battle to release a second record, the album ""Don't Say No"" was released under the new name [a1696916]. In addition to a new name, the band took on a new musical direction adding horns and percussion and a more layered approach. Without the support of the label and the lack of press, even the band's fan base didn't know of their new record.

The band soon split up and went their separate ways in various musical and theatrical endeavors. The Butler brothers eventually founded the band [a777576].

Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

A chance meeting with guitar virtuoso Hartley Cain led to the formation of a rock band. He rapidly built up a large fan base around the Midlands, London and Germany. The rock career lost momentum when the major album Rogues & Thieves did not take off but he did get on Top Of The Pops as part of his mate, Roy Wood¹s band, The Move. Gradually his music became more Country and he was invited by Mervyn Conn to be part of the famed Wembley Festivals. Mervyn Conn backed two albums recorded in Nashville with the Jordanaires and Hargus Pig Robbins. The first, Southern Fried Frog was and still is a massive seller. Froggie did and still does sing 99 percent of his own material and he has the largest following of any UK artist.
His autobiography, Raymond Who?, is a great read. UK singers cover more of his songs than any other writer. When he released Don't Let Me Cry Again, Terry Wogan played it every day for a fortnight but unfortunately a distribution blip stopped it being a major pop hit.
After fighting health problems he was still a major player on the UK Country scene having played with most of the major American artists including Tina Turner who recorded one of his songs.

They reached Number 27 in 1977 with the single 'Cor Baby, That's Really Free' but Otway's most remembered for accidentally crushing his 'crown jewels' on an amplifier whilst performing a cover of the Bob Lind song 'Cheryl's Going Home' live on the BBC's 'Old Grey Whistle Test'. Aside from numerous 'on/off' stints with Barrett he has also collaborated with Attila The Stockbroker and has gained a hardcore following performing as a solo artist and also with his 'Big Band'. Some 25 years after the 'Hit' he achieved his second (and highest charting) hit with 'Bunsen Burner' (straight in at Number 9) which was achieved via a Social Media campaign and the incredible support of his fan base. In 2013 Otway premiered his biopic 'Otway - The Movie' at the Odeon, Leicester Square, which was received with critical acclaim by the media. Ever the one for clever ways to sell his records Otway has tried them all (with varying degrees of success and failure) from releasing singles without vocals to circulating discs with counterfeit WEA labels to using the sleeves as free entry to gigs.

Bryars wanted to engage the masses with classical music, and sought a way to liberate the form from the pomposity of its audience. His idea was to form an orchestra of the people. Anyone could join, regardless of skill. 

The orchestra comprised known musicians playing instruments they had no knowledge of, virtuoso players and people who had never played an instrument in their lives. Their oeuvré would encompass the popular classics and rock songs - music that could be played by ear. No sight-reading skills were therefore required. The virtuoso players kept everything vaguely within the realms of what might be called a tune, with the other players reaching for (and missing) notes nearby. The result was a fascinating atonal mess of a noise, one which was considered profound by several of Bryars classical contemporaries. 

The hilarious results of this experiment led to the Portsmouth Sinfonia's records being pitched at the comedy market which earned them a cult following, enough for them to be selling out the Royal Albert Hall by 1974. 

Although it ceased performing in 1982, the Portsmouth Sinfonia never formally disbanded. At the time of writing (March 2006) there are whispers that more concerts might just be forthcoming…

Elvis Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including rock 'n' roll, pop, country and gospel, he is one of the best-selling music artists in the history of recorded music. He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into a.o. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Country Music Hall of Fame, Rockabilly Hall of Fame and Gospel Hall of Fame. 
He is often referred to as ""The King of Rock and Roll"", or simply, ""The King"".

Japan comprised David Sylvian (vocals), his brother Steve Jansen (drums), Richard Barbieri (keyboards) and Mick Karn (saxophone/bass). Rob (Robert) Dean joined the line-up as guitarist and the band subsequently won a recording contract with the German record company Ariola-Hansa.  Eminently unfashionable in the UK punk era, they first found success in Japan.

After three albums with Ariola-Hansa, they switched to Virgin Records in 1980 and found their fortunes dramatically improving thanks to the surge of popularity in the New Romantic movement. Japan's androgynous image made them suddenly fashionable and they registered several UK Top 20 singles. Their albums Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) and Tin Drum (1981) were also well received.  Rob Dean left the band after Gentlemen Take Polaroids but continued working with the band for one more tour thereafter.

Disagreements between Karn and Sylvian undermined the band's progress just as they were achieving some long-overdue success, and they split in late 1982.  The members diversified into collaborative work and solo careers, reuniting (minus Dean) in 1991 for a project under the moniker of Rain Tree Crow."

Formed in 1978, Eliffant produced original material during the golden era of the Welsh language music scene. 

The songs were written and sung by Geraint Griffiths, and would probably be described as melodic rock, with twinges of folk, country, heavy metal, Americana and even jazz.

When Welsh group Injaroc split in 1977, Geraint found himself band-less until John Davies a guitarist and a member of Chwys approached him with Clive Richards on bass and Colin Owen on drums. After a few rehearsals, it was obvious there was a huge hole where the keyboards should be. In 1978 Euros Lewis with his Fender Rhodes Piano turned up, and that was when Eliffant were properly formed.

The band built up quite a reputation and following, based on high production values on stage and on record, and constant gigging throughout Wales.

The high-point for the band was when Eliffant were voted Best Rock Band 1979 by the readers of Sgrech magazine. They appeared on HTV and BBC television and recorded radio spots up until 1981 when the original five-piece band fizzled out, but re-formed a few months later with Gordon Jones replacing Colin Owen on the drums. Eliffant lasted another two years, but Geraint himself launched into a very successful solo career that continues today.

A percussionist and band leader, Lawal left Nigeria to settle in the UK in the mid-60s. Basing himself in London, he became rapidly established in the session scene, and over the next 10 years recorded with a large number of local and visiting musicians, covering a wide variety of styles, including Ginger Baker’s Airforce, Stephen Stills, the Rolling Stones, George Clinton’s Funkadelic and Barbra Streisand. In 1975, he joined London-based rock band Clancy, leaving in 1977 to return to Nigeria. Moving back to London in 1978, Lawal formed his own group, Afriki Sound (later renamed the Drum Oro Band), creating a highly individual style which succeeded in marrying traditional West African roots music and instrumentation with elements of experimental rock and jazz. A fervent believer in the value of traditional African music, Lawal was also convinced that it needed to develop and could benefit from the incorporation of certain western ideas and influences. With Afriki Sound he released two superb albums on his own Cap label, Ajomase (which in Yoruba means ‘We all have to do it together’), which spawned two dancefloor hit singles in ‘Kita Kita’ and ‘Oromoro’, and Abiosunni (Yoruba for ‘Are you sleeping or what?!’). Both albums featured the cream of expatriate African musicians living in London, notably Olalekan Babolola (percussion), Tunji Omoshebi (trumpet), Abdul Salongo (guitar), Don Amaechi (guitar, percussion, kora, keyboards), Ray Allen (saxophones) and Osibisa’s Mac Tontoh (trumpet). In the mid-80s, Lawal was a founder member of Britain’s Black Music Association, a pressure group which worked to achieve greater exposure and better working conditions for black musicians. In the late 80s he once again embraced a wide range of session work, including spells alongside the Pogues, UB40 and Robert Palmer. In 1989 he toured with Zairean superstar Papa Wemba and appeared in a Royal Command Performance before the Queen and President Babangida. In 1990 sessions began on his third album, the critically acclaimed Kodara, effectively a masterclass in traditional percussion. "

'Theme From Harry's Game' was released in the winter of 1982. Radio programmers and audiences were captivated by the dense harmonies and the Gaelic words. It leapt into the Top five in the UK charts. The 'Magical Ring' album followed in 1983, and by now brothers Pol and Ciaran were writing evocative and powerful music. This was furthered on 'Legend' a soundtrack commissioned for the television series, 'Robin Of Sherwood' in 1984. During this period, the band received numerous awards including an Ivor Novello and a BAFTA for their ground-breaking work on this album.

This primed the band for one of their most mesmeric records. 'Macalla', released in 1985, featured more electronic arrangements, while Maire's voice was reaching the extremes of joy and melancholy. A chance remark to their friends in U2 resulted in Bono singing a duet with Maire on the track 'In A Lifetime'. This charted twice, in 1986 and again in 1989. The follow-up, 'Sirius' was completed in Los Angeles with some of the city's most famous musicians, as the Clannad sound took another unscripted change.

'PastPresent', released in 1989 brought the music of Clannad to an even bigger audience. Summarising their first four RCA albums it became a much-loved fixture in the UK chart eventually going Top 5. The BBC had obviously noted the huge success of the soundtrack to Robin and commissioned a project that would become the outstanding album 'Atlantic Realm'. This was followed in the same year by Clannad's first soundtrack work on an animation, 'Angel And The Soldier Boy'.

Maire, Padraig and Noel were writing more now, supplementing Ciaran's work. The latter was also honing his skills as a producer. Their 'Anam' album made the top 20 in 1990. 'Theme From Harry's Game' featured on the 1992 film Patriot Games, featuring Harrison Ford, raising the band's profile again in America. The band's music was increasingly in demand for soundtrack work, appearing on Last Of The Mohicans, (1992) and Message In A Bottle (1999)."

 UK band, formed in 1983 from the remnants of 'CIVIL DEFENCE'. Had a couple of air plays on the John Peel Show.
Paranoia's roots began in Stoke-on-Trent in 1979 when Paul bought his brother Phil a set of drums, Paul already having learnt to play guitar, the two of them set about covering punked up versions of Bowie and T-Rex classics! they soon found it time to expand and to bring in a vocalist and bass player through ads in the national music press in 1980, the only suitable reply was from a vocalist, Ged, from Market Drayton, who said he would bring his mate along, Steve who was actually a drummer but would have go on bass. Watched by Paul's sister Jan and husband Mick, the band which had no name at this point, rehearsed for there first and last time with this line up as the next time they were due to rehearse, Ged and Steve didn't bother to turn up. Jan felt a bit sorry for her brothers so said she would have a go at vocals and Mick started to learn bass guitar from Paul. They then advertised for a lead guitarist to fill out their sound and found Dave in '81, there first song ""1984"" was written at this time and they adopted a synthesizer played by Jan. Dave tried to influence the direction of the band too much and was eventually asked to leave the group, which still had no proper name or gigs.
Later in '81 they brought in another guitarist- Phil H and his girlfriend Gwyn took over on synth, and called themslved CIVIL DEFENSE and started to get a few gigs, some through CND and one through the Stoke musicans collective, they continued to gig locally until 1983 when Phil and Gwyn amicably left the band.
That left Jan- vocals, Paul- guitar, Mick- bass and Phil- drums, the name Civil Defense was changed to Paranoia, the synthesizer was dropped and they took on a more aggressive punk sound, although by no means ""hardcore"", and bringing in some new songs and gradually leaving out the older ones.
Finding gigs difficult to come by through the closure of local venues they decided the only way to get heard was to make a demo. In September '83 they hired a studio and recorded the first demo which included the tracks ""The Gig"", ""Rock Revolution"", ""Shattered Glass"", ""Robots"", ""Disillusion"", and ""Graveyard Of Hell"", copies of the demo were sent to various independent labels, most replied but they all more or less said ""great potential, but the punk market is dead"", Rot records being the only label to show any interest and offer them a place on a compilation album, the Paranoia songs used on this album were well received and led to a deal to release a lp and single which again received favourable reviews despite the somewhat limited distribution... by 1985 they had left Rot Records after turning down a prospective tour with labelmates the VARUKERS, just after this Paul the guitarist left and Russ Lovettt joined in his place and they proceeded to release the 1986 cassette abum ""Pain And Pleasure"" which was only available from the band at their gigs and through the mail.

Founded in the beginning of the 1980's as pure rockabilly band

Long before terms like Psychobilly and Neorockabilly became common , The Deltas had already started spreading their own brand of high-energy Rock`n´Roll. The original lineup was Steve Bongo (vocals, drums), Captain Pat Marvel (guitar) and Little John (bass) and the trio recorded a demo tape in 1980, loaded with 50´s Rockabilly obscurities like Who Told You?, My Babe or Your Wildcat Ways. A year later they'd already got quite a reputation to be one of the wildest live acts and most talented rocking bands out there. Roy Williams, who had just started his own record company, contracted the Deltas and recorded the now classic Boogie Disease album with them in the Pathway Studios. He introduced them on the back sleeve of the longplayer as ""-wilder than the Polecats-crazier than The Meteors"". The album sold well and The Deltas became very busy touring the UK and the rest of Europe, playing small clubs as well as some of the big RnR weekenders. 

Some years later, the lineup was enlarged to a five-piece outfit with well-known ex-Polecat Boz Boorer (g) & John Buck (d) and the band released their more weirder, more diverse second album, Mad For It (1986), on ID Records, followed by another studio output Tuffer Than Tuff (1988) , a four track EP entitled You Can´t Judge A Book(1988) and a live album on the Link Records Live and Rockin´ (1989) series. 

Their unique blend of high-power Rockabilly, Blues and pure Rock`n´Roll energy still attracts both Psychobilly and Rockabilly followings all over the world and the band has also been included on many essential Psychobilly compilation albums, such as The Magnificent Seven and Hell's Bent On Rockin´ .

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015. The ZFT produced numerous posthumous releases and remasters of the back catalog. The children inherited the ZFT and remain in the industry,  [a237886] the force behind [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/2843814-Dweezil-Zappa-Plays-Zappa] ""[i]Zappa Plays Zappa[/i]"" [/url] as well as an accomplished guitarist in his own right; [a296279], [a1635870] and the more reserved [a296276].

Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1994 (Performer).

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

Big Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit. The band's lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career.

The Apostles were an experimental post-punk band who developed within the confines of the 1980s Anarcho Punk scene in the UK, but did not necessarily adhere to the aesthetics of that movement. 

Although the core of the group remained stable, Andy Martin and Dave Fanning were joined by various members over their 10 year span. Variation was also key in music styles as they varied from pop to punk to industrial through to pure experimentation, with influences like The Velvet Underground, The Adverts, Alternative TV, Lemon Kittens, The Pop Group and Twelve Cubic Feet cited. 

Although highly critical of the seemingly inward looking anarchist movement of the times, the autonomous and libertarian approach of The Apostles seemed to portray classic anarchism, as opposed to the conformity of many of their contemporaries. This led to much respect from notable members of the original anarcho-punk movement such as Crass with whom the band co-operated during the squatting of the Zig-Zag Club and running of [l=The Autonomy Centre] and [l=Centro Iberico] venues, and Conflict who released a single and album by The Apostles on their Mortarhate label. 

Originally formed in 1980 by William Corbett, Julian Portinari, Dan MacIntyre and Pete Bynghall, the band came into its own when Andy Martin joined to contribute lead vocals and lyrics. Shortly afterwards he was joined by Dave Fanning, ex-Innocent Bystander bassist. During this period the band recorded numerous DIY demo cassettes. In 1983 The Apostles released their first 7"" single and were joined by 14 year old Scottish drummer Chris Low, ex-Political Asylum. It is from this time that The Apostles have been described as having started their 'proper recording career', releasing four classic singles, the best of which are shortly to see a long overdue re-release on CD, plus numerous full-length albums and further cassette releases.

The Apostles split up in 1989, immediately forming [a=Academy 23] who released a number of works. Andy Martin & Dave Fanning continued as [a=Unit (6)] although Dave Fanning left Unit in 2007, leaving Andy Martin and Colin Murrell as the only members of Apostles in UNIT."

Biography

1979-1987

Cloven Hoof went through a few early line-up changes, including a brief spell with vocalist Steve Sammon, before settling on a steady line-up that would last their first few recordings. Theatrical from the beginning, the four band members took up pseudonyms after the four elements - David ""Water"" Potter, Steve ""Fire"" Rounds, Lee ""Air"" Payne and Kevin ""Earth"" Poutney. This line-up recorded the band's successful demo tape from 1982, along with The Opening Ritual EP, and Cloven Hoof.

Following the release of their self-titled debut, David Potter left the band to be replaced by Rob Kendrick, who took up the ""Water"" pseudonym. This line-up only managed to record the live album Fighting Back, before splitting up completely soon after the release of the album. Lee Payne was the only member left, and soldiered on through the years.

1988-1990

Lee Payne started the band again in 1988, hiring vocalist Russ North and guitarist Andy Wood from the split up band Tredegar along with drummer Jon Brown.

With a whole new set of musicians in place, the band dropped the stage names and went on to record two more albums - 1988's Dominator and 1989's A Sultan's Ransom. Former member of Sweet Andy Scott was brought to the band for the role of second guitarist soon after the release of these two albums, but contractual difficulties caused the band to split up in 1990.

2001-2007

In the summer of 2001, Lee Payne began putting a new line-up together for the next reincarnation of Cloven Hoof when Andy Wood had phoned him about the contractual difficulties that had utlimately caused the band to split up for a whole decade.

After a few years work and failure to entice back any previous Hoof members, Eye of the Sun was recorded and released in 2006 with the help of studio musicians Matt Moreton on vocals, Andy Shortland on guitars, and Lynch Radinsky on drums. According to Payne, it was the first Cloven Hoof album to have been produced without any obstacles that plagued them in the 1980s, but even though he was proud of the album's successful production, he still wanted Russ North to provide his own vocals for it instead of Moreton's.

Following the successful comeback release, the three hired musicians by Payne left once Russ North returned to the fold after finally taking care of the obstacles that prevented him from rejoining a few years earlier. A brief period of line-up fluctuation could be seen on the band's website over the following few months, with former member Jon Brown briefly listed as being back on board.

Eventually the line-up seemed to settle with Mick Powell, a guitarist almost hired by Cloven Hoof in the early '80s. In another unannounced change, Jon Brown rejoined.

2008

A collection of re-recorded songs The Definitive Part One was released in early 2008, with a new album to be called Throne of Damnation scheduled for release in 2009. Mick Powell played guitar and keyboards on The Definitive Part One but had left the band by the time it was released. Cloven Hoof continued for a few months as a four-piece again before Powell briefly rejoined in April 2008 and was eventually replaced by Christian Horton.

Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends [a=Gram Parsons] and [a=Chris Hillman] (both former members of [a=The Byrds]), the group underwent many personnel changes. 

The original group featured Parsons and Hillman as primary vocalists, guitarists and composers with [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow] (pedal steel guitar), [a=Chris Ethridge] (bass) and a rotating series of drummers. [a=Michael Clarke] (also a former member of The Byrds) was eventually added as permanent drummer, while Ethridge was replaced by guitarist [a=Bernie Leadon] after Hillman switched to bass following the first album.

Following the second album Burrito Deluxe, Gram Parsons was succeeded as frontman by [a=Rick Roberts] for one studio album and a live album. The group then splintered; Chris Hillman and [a=Al Perkins] (Kleinow's replacement) joined [a=Manassas], Bernie Leadon founded [a=Eagles], and later additions [a=Byron Berline], [a=Roger Bush] and [a=Kenny Wertz] formed [a=Country Gazette]. Following a 1973 European tour with new members, Rick Roberts dissolved the band and began a solo career, before forming [a=Firefall] with Michael Clarke. 

After original members Kleinow and Ethridge reformed the band in the mid-1970s with new players (including more former members of The Byrds, [a=Gene Parsons] and [a=Skip Battin]), a more Nashville-centered incarnation of the band led by [a=Gib Guilbeau] and [a=John Beland] eventually emerged, recording & touring through the 1980s as [a=Burrito Brothers].

Pete Kleinow began using the Flying Burritos Bros name again in the mid 1980s, eventually being joined by Gib and John.  Through numerous incarnations (nearly all with Beland at the helm), the band released albums and toured throughout the 1980s and '90s. The latter day Flying Burrito Brothers CDs, produced by Beland, did feature an impressive line-up of guests, including [a=Merle Haggard], [a=Buck Owens], [a=Waylon Jennings], [a=Alison Krauss], [a=Ricky Skaggs], [a=Charles Louvin], and others. The band's final two CDs, [m=1168733] and [r=5398239] received solid critical reviews, but Beland called it quits for the band in 2000, finally ending the band. He embarked upon a successful career as a record producer, The trademark for Flying Burrito Brothers' name was acquired by Chris Hillman in the 2010s.

Kleinow's 2000s spin-off band [a=Burrito Deluxe] featured [a=Carlton Moody (2)] on lead vocals and [a=Garth Hudson] from [a=The Band] on keyboards. The band scored no chart success, relying solely on live appearances in Europe. Kleinow left the band due to illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to any of the actual Flying Burrito Brothers members, past or present, although the band carried on until 2010 when it became [a=The Burritos], and then in 2014 [a=The Burrito Brothers].

Glass Tiger won three Juno Awards in 1986 and two more in 1987. They were also nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987. 

After their third album Simple Mission and a brief Canadian tour in early 1993, the band went on a lengthy hiatus.

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.  In 2021, former bassist Rudy Sarzo returned to the band."

The name is a contradiction in terms, “Violent” being self-explanatory and “Femmes” being Milwaukee slang for wimp.
The rhythm section added high school singer/songwriter Gordon Gano in 1981. Gano and Ritchie had previously performed together at Gano’s National Honor Society induction ceremony, where they caused a near riot. Gano was expelled from the Society and suspended from high school for this outrage. 
One of the only stable aspects of the band is their aversion to rehearsal. Due to this they would take the music to the streets in an attempt to hone it and earn some spare change. It was on one of these occasions that they were spotted by the Pretenders. Chrissie Hynde and the gang were so amused by the Violent Femmes antics that they invited the band to open the show for them. The hometown Milwaukee audience received the Femmes with unanimous booing. However by the end of the set the Femmes had converted approximately 50% of the audience to their cause. Many years later Brian Ritchie encountered Hynde when the Femmes and Pretenders shared the bill at a radio concert. She said, “Oh, you’re still around.”
The Femmes borrowed $10,000 from Victor De Lorenzo’s dad to record their legendary first album in 1982. Slash Records in Los Angeles was the only label to offer them a deal with the amazing advance of $0. The band accepted the deal and started on the predictable round of world tours, recording, more world tours, nervous breakdowns, band members quitting, solo albums, regrouping, more touring, divorces, more crackups, dropped from record deals, new deals, more touring, record company going bankrupt, lawsuits, etc. etc. etc. ad infinitum. 
Fast forward to the present. Many things have changed. One thing that hasn’t is the sound of the band. Their loose, improvisational, acoustic sound is timeless.

Formed in a squat in Leeds, England, in 1982, Chumbawamba released their first single, ""Revolution"", in 1985. Up to a point they self-released most of their material on labels they ran themselves, such as [l74128] and [l22496]. Their musical style has changed through the years, initially a shouting punk band, later recording some folk songs, then, with the ""Jesus H Christ"" album, they discovered electronic music. 

That album, however, was built around numerous samples of other groups and, when they found out how much clearing them would cost, they scrapped it (though, it was released as a bootleg and, in recent years, via their chumbawamba.tv site as mp3s) and rerecorded the album without the samples and with a new focus on censorship. 

""Anarchy"" was their response to criticism from their contemporaries for their move into pop music, funny, political and musically experimental. The anti-Nazi song ""Enough is Enough"", recorded with regular collaborator MC Fusion, was released as a single and launched Fusion's new group Credit to the Nation. They had minor chart success, but nothing compared to what was to come. 

The disappointing ""Swingin' with Raymond"" followed and was the end of their relationship with One Little Indian. Deciding that there's no such thing as a good capitalist, big or small, they signed with EMI, whom they had criticised in the past. The band were heavily criticised once again, but the massive worldwide success of ""Tubthumper"" allowed the band to fund numerous political campaigns around the world. 

They were never to repeat the success of that single and proudly proclaimed themselves one hit wonders and their relationship with EMI only lasted one more album and a few singles. Independent again with Mutt Records, and with long-time producer Neil Ferguson now officially a member, they have continued to experiment with their style, recording ""Readymades"", mixing folk samples with dance beats, the soundtrack to the Alex Cox film ""Revengers Tragedy"" and their latest release, ""UN"", recorded on a mini disc in Latin America and at Chumbawamba's Bradford studio, mixing styles and sounds from different parts of the world.

Since then, the group slimmed down to just Lou, Neil, Boff and Jude, and added Phil Moody on accordion to play folk music with pop influences. The other members have moved on to their own projects.  

Always controversial, often under attack from the left and the right, Chumbawamba have always done things their own way and, in their own words, ""Never do what you are told."" 

In August 2012 the band decided to call it quits after some final gigs in their 30th year of existence mainly because ""the rest of our lives got in the way and we couldn’t commit the time and enthusiasm that the band demanded.""

Pink Peg Slax are a rockabilly band from Leeds, England.

Their anarchic approach made them briefly favourites of BBC Radio One cult DJ John Peel, and their gigs and records were favourably reviewed in the UK music press. The NME’s James Brown opined “If Elvis had been a Marx Brother, he would have invented Pink Peg Slax."" John Peel called their music “Cajun-tinged jive-a-billy”. Despite recording several BBC Radio One sessions and getting day-time BBC Radio One airplay during 1984-88, none of the band’s records sold that well, probably due to their disruptive approach, which antagonised the indie scene by being authentically rockabilly, and the rockabilly scene by being authentically indie. Their irreverent attitude also puzzled major record companies and the band were never signed to a major label. Pink Peg Slax appeared on the 2023 Cherry Red Records release Where Were You?, a history of the Leeds indie music scene in the 1980s."

Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1994 (Performer).

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

In 1985 he released his first solo LP Electrical Storm followed by Rooms Of The Magnificent in 1986 and a further 14 studio albums between 1987 and 2000. In a stunning burst of creativity in 1992 and 1993, he recorded 3 of his best regarded records in 18 months, viz. Honey Steels Gold; Black Ticket Day and Serene Machine, whilst also finding time to record 2 albums with his side project [a=The Aints].

Although in the 1990s his records did break into the lower reaches of the charts, commercial success has largely eluded him, and in recent times this may be at least partially due to the wide range of musical styles he has covered - from blues (on Today Wonder) to experimentation with beats (A King In The Kindness Room), ambient (The Blue House) and soundtracks (Starstruck). 

After a 7 year hiatus, Kuepper's 17th solo studio album Jean Lee And The Yellow Dog, a concept album about the last woman hanged in Australia,  was released to critical acclaim in 2007. In early 2009 Ed Kuepper played in reformed original versions of The Saints and reformed Laughing Clowns to play at the All Tomorrow's Parties Festival curated by [a=Nick Cave].

Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends [a=Gram Parsons] and [a=Chris Hillman] (both former members of [a=The Byrds]), the group underwent many personnel changes. 

The original group featured Parsons and Hillman as primary vocalists, guitarists and composers with [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow] (pedal steel guitar), [a=Chris Ethridge] (bass) and a rotating series of drummers. [a=Michael Clarke] (also a former member of The Byrds) was eventually added as permanent drummer, while Ethridge was replaced by guitarist [a=Bernie Leadon] after Hillman switched to bass following the first album.

Following the second album Burrito Deluxe, Gram Parsons was succeeded as frontman by [a=Rick Roberts] for one studio album and a live album. The group then splintered; Chris Hillman and [a=Al Perkins] (Kleinow's replacement) joined [a=Manassas], Bernie Leadon founded [a=Eagles], and later additions [a=Byron Berline], [a=Roger Bush] and [a=Kenny Wertz] formed [a=Country Gazette]. Following a 1973 European tour with new members, Rick Roberts dissolved the band and began a solo career, before forming [a=Firefall] with Michael Clarke. 

After original members Kleinow and Ethridge reformed the band in the mid-1970s with new players (including more former members of The Byrds, [a=Gene Parsons] and [a=Skip Battin]), a more Nashville-centered incarnation of the band led by [a=Gib Guilbeau] and [a=John Beland] eventually emerged, recording & touring through the 1980s as [a=Burrito Brothers].

Pete Kleinow began using the Flying Burritos Bros name again in the mid 1980s, eventually being joined by Gib and John.  Through numerous incarnations (nearly all with Beland at the helm), the band released albums and toured throughout the 1980s and '90s. The latter day Flying Burrito Brothers CDs, produced by Beland, did feature an impressive line-up of guests, including [a=Merle Haggard], [a=Buck Owens], [a=Waylon Jennings], [a=Alison Krauss], [a=Ricky Skaggs], [a=Charles Louvin], and others. The band's final two CDs, [m=1168733] and [r=5398239] received solid critical reviews, but Beland called it quits for the band in 2000, finally ending the band. He embarked upon a successful career as a record producer, The trademark for Flying Burrito Brothers' name was acquired by Chris Hillman in the 2010s.

Kleinow's 2000s spin-off band [a=Burrito Deluxe] featured [a=Carlton Moody (2)] on lead vocals and [a=Garth Hudson] from [a=The Band] on keyboards. The band scored no chart success, relying solely on live appearances in Europe.

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

The band was formed in 1979 under the name Tyrant, with Dave Chandler (guitar, vocals), Mark Adams (bass), and Armando Acosta (drums), but soon added Scott Reagers on vocals and changed their name to Saint Vitus after the song ""St. Vitus' Dance"" by Black Sabbath. Their main influences were Sabbath and Black Flag, the latter of which Saint Vitus toured with during the 1980's.

Under this line-up, Saint Vitus recorded 2 albums, ""Saint Vitus"" & ""Hallow's Victim"", and an EP ""The Walking Dead"". After ""The Walking Dead"" Reagers left the band and was replaced by The Obsessed frontman Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich (at this time, The Obsessed had only released one 7"").

Wino recorded three studio albums (""Born Too Late"", ""Mournful Cries"" & ""V""), a live album (""Live""), and an EP (""Thirsty and Miserable"", featuring the Black Flag cover of the same name) with Vitus. Weinrich left Saint Vitus in 1991 to reform The Obsessed after Vitus's label, Hellhound Records, released an album of older Obsessed recordings.

Following Weinrich's departure, Saint Vitus went on hiatus. The band finally found former Count Raven singer Christian Lindersson as Weinrich's replacement. He would record only one album, ""C.O.D."" before being replaced by original Vitus vocalist, Scott Reagers. 

Reagers recorded vocals for the band's final album, ""Die Healing"". After this, Saint Vitus decided to call it a day in 1996.

""Born Too Late"" line-up (Weinrich, Chandler, Adams, Acosta) played a gig at Double Door in Chicago.The performance was recorded and released on a DVD that is distributed through Chandler's current band, Debris, Inc., which features former Trouble bassist Ron Holzner. Following the reunion, Saint Vitus parted ways again.

As of 2008, Saint Vitus have reformed again. The band headlined the April 24 date at the 2009 Roadburn Festival.  The lineup for this reunion was the same as the 2003 reunion. Sometime after this gig, drummer Armando Acosta was removed from the band and was replaced by Henry Vasquez, with health concerns being cited as the primary case for his removal (Acosta eventually passed away in November 2010).

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988.

In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018.

Starting out as a 2-piece, Ashemoore & Hosein released the single ""Late Flowering Lust"" in 1985 on their own label Evensong.

Upon recording their follow-up ""The Man Who Would Be King"" the trio brought in Cragg (who had guested on the debut on drums) and Brian E. Roberts, who had previously performed with Taylor in The Passmore Sisters.

Steve Whitehouse: Vocals and Upright Bass
Steve Eaton: Guitars
Adam Seviour: Drums

Frenzy are a 3 piece band, formed in the August of 1983, during the successful revival of the Rock-a-Billy music scene around that time. Steve Whitehouse, the founder member of the group, had already found success with his previous two outifts, most notably ' The Sharks ', another 3 piece Rock-a-Billy band who had released an album and various other ditties since their formation in 1981. Indeed, Steve has been actively involved in music since 1980. Citing musical differences, Steve left The Sharks to pursue his destiny with Frenzy.

Frenzy came to be in a music shop in Bristol, when Steve and an old friend, Simon Brand, were playing around with guitars and double basses one Saturday afternoon. Steve, 17 at the time, approached Simon about playing guitar and the rest, as they say, is history. Using old contacts and a new demo tape, Frenzy soon clinched an album deal and commenced recording on the first of ten albums to date. Merv Pepler, now of Ozric Tentacles and Eat Static fame, completed the line-up on drums.

The 3 piece soon found out they had strong song-writing abilities, creating early anthems like Robot Riot, Hall Of Mirrors, Frenzy, Cry or Die and Sweet Money. The group soon found themselves propelled to the top of their scene. Mostly bypassing support slots, Frenzy became a headlining act within a year of forming, making regular trips to London and other major U.K. cities. On top of all this, the agency that took The Sharks into Europe took Frenzy on, arranging sell-out club dates throughout Holland and Germany.

Frenzy's popularity had not gone un-noticed by some of the larger independent record labels, and soon Frenzy had been signed by ID Records in London. The new album, ' Clockwork Toy ', hit the independent charts like a rocket, and the single, ' I See Red ', went Top 10 in 3 weeks. Reaching a high spot of number 3, the single remained in the top 30 for 27 weeks. The album hit Number 8 and stayed there for 6 weeks, during which time Radio 1 picked up on Frenzy's success and played I See Red no less than 21 times. Spun by DJ's such as Janice Long, John Peel, Andy Kershaw, Bruno Brooks and Steve Wright.

In a career spanning 20 years, Frenzy have tasted the big time touring the world, reaching places such as Holland, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain. Radio and T.V. appearances became commonplace, and a deal was signed in Japan for simultaneous releases of Frenzy albums in both Japan and North America.

The band has undergone several line-up changes over the years. Musicians have come and gone as they do, and inevitably a little influence of each band member has stayed, making Frenzy a rich mixture of musical cultures. It is safe to say the group still uses the Rock-a-Billy thing as it's foundation, but also Blues, Heavy Rock and Punk can be heard. The music scene has changed but Frenzy are still going strong. In December of 2002, Frenzy released their 10th album, ' Dirty Little Devils ', an album they are most proud of. Twelve classic Frenzy tracks that have received much critical acclaim. The band have not heard a single negative comment from anybody. The whole package is selling like hot cakes. Currently the trio are recording their 11th album, a 21st anniversary special addition cd, and are still making regular trips abroad to headline festivals.


Steve Whitehouse has been dubbed ' King of the Slap Bass ' by followers and peers alike, and backs up his playing abilities with a powerful voice and energetic live performance. Steve recently took part in a Terence Higgins Trust Aids Project, which saw him contributing his bass playing to an album which included Sham '69, Sting, Elton John, The Revillo's, The Meteors and many others. Now back with The Sharks as well, Steve say's, "" I just can't leave music alone.....it's in the blood, being on stage is what i live for.....""

Steve Eaton has been with the band 5 years. He is an accomplished guitarist, who also plays for Punk outfit ' Far-Cue '. Steve has played for a number of different styled bands, which has given him a rich insight into a variety of different techniques. His input into Frenzy is invaluble. On stage he is a man possessed, and off stage has struck up a great song-writing partnership with Steve Whitehouse.

Rob Chapman has been playing drums for 17 years and comes from a varied musical background. He has played Soul, Rock n Roll, and Heavy Rock with his last venture before joining Frenzy, being part of a comedy trio, ' Stumpy, Ginge and Tubs ', a skillful musical unit who were much in demand. Rob has been a member of Frenzy since May 2002, and as well as being a solid player, provides much welcomed comic relief whilst on the road.

[a=Mark Burgess] had been in [a=The Clichés], while [a=Reg Smithies] & [A=Dave Fielding] were in [a=Years (3)]. Dave was in a school band called Sen. The three started without a drummer and got the attention of the legendary Radio 1 DJ [a=John Peel]. After the recruitment of drummer [a=John Lever] of [a=The Politicians (6)], their first single ""In Shreds"" on CBS, made number 42 on John Peel's Festive Fifty in 1982. They originally signed with CBS, but they disagreed with how they should sound. CBS dropped them after the one single, despite encouraging sales. They soon signed with Statik. However, Statik was distributed by Virgin, so they couldn't qualify for the independent charts and were thus overlooked by the music press.
The debut album, ""Script of the Bridge"", was recorded in Rochdale during a six-week period. The band was really pissed when they found out about the reduced version which was released by MCA in the US. They then became unhappy with Statik and tried to get away from them, but were bound by contractual obligations. After their second album, ""What Does Anything Mean? Basically"", they signed with Geffen. While signed to Geffen, the band released what was to be their last album together for fifteen years, ""Strange Times"" as the band literally fell apart, acrimoniously, with grief after the 1987 sudden death of band manager Tony Fletcher.
The year 2000 saw an end to the 'hostilities' and a reforming of the group; and a new 'unplugged' album entitled 'Strip' and other live releases followed.

John Lever passed away in 2017 and Dave left the band afterwards leaving Mark and Reg as the only two original members. The Chameleons continue to perform as of 2024.

Formed by guitarist Kirk Hammett & drummer Tom Hunting (who initially handled vocals as well). The group was rounded out by guitarist Tim Agnello and bassist Carlton Melson. The line up shifted several times in the early years.

1982 - 1985

In 1982, Exodus included Kirk Hammett and Gary Holt on guitars, Paul Baloff on lead vocals, Geoff Andrews on bass and drummer Tom Hunting. This lineup recorded the band's 1982 demo.

In 1983, founding member Kirk Hammett left Exodus to join Metallica and was replaced by guitarist Rick Hunolt and Rob McKillop replaced Andrews on bass. This line-up recorded and released their debut album, ""Bonded by Blood"" in 1984 (released in 1985).

1986 - 1991

Shortly before the recording of ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" in 1987, Paul Baloff was replaced by Steve ""Zetro"" Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for the San Francisco band Legacy (later known as Testament). Baloff later went on to form the band [a=Piranha (9)].

In 1989, the band released ""Fabulous Disaster"" which garnered good press and, eventually, a major label deal.  That same year, Tom Hunting departed, leaving the group with no founding members.  In 1991 the band released their first live effort, ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", which featured new bassist Mike Butler.

1991 - 1998

After the release of ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", the band toured sporadically for a year and released another studio album, ""Force of Habit"". This album was a departure for the band, containing several slower, ""heavier"" songs with less emphasis on the speed/thrash basis of their older material.  Unable to match the commercial success of some of their peers and dealing with internal stresses and problems, Exodus split in 1994.

After a few dormant years, Exodus released only another live album in 1997 titled ""Another Lesson in Violence"" and featuring the return of vocalist Paul Baloff and new bassist Jack Gibson. Exodus disintegrated again, partly due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

2001 - 2004

In 2001, Exodus reformed again, initially to play the Chuck Billy benefit, the ""Thrash of the Titans"" mega concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local gigs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. In February 2002, Paul Baloff suffered a seizure/stroke from which he eventually died. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments.

Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004's ""Tempo of the Damned"" released on Nuclear Blast.

2005 - Present

In 2005, Hunolt decided to leave the band to concentrate on his family life. He was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also left, citing strong personal objections over some of Holt's anti-Christian lyrics as well as anxiety issues. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph who had previously played with Forbidden, Slayer and Testament.  Souza also left under disputed terms in 2005. 
He was replaced intitially by Steev Esquivel (ex-Defiance and Skinlab) and then later by Rob Dukes whose first recorded performance for the band is 2005's ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine"". 

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007.  In 2012, Rick Hunolt returned in a guest role, filling in for Gary Holt on several live dates while Holt toured with [a=Slayer].  In 2014, Steve Souza returned to the group. He departed again in January 2025, with Rob Dukes returning as vocalist.

Their first recording was a demo called [b][i]Ever Be The Prize[/i][/b], and was recorded at a studio in Blanefield (Scotland) in 1985. They recorded a number of songs with Rog Patterson (of ""Twice Bitten"" fame) as producer, which were then further refined with the assistance of [a=Mike Bentley] and [a=Niall Mathewson] ([a=Pallas (2)]). These were released as a ""mini album"" in 1986, strongly influenced by Pallas or [a=Abel Ganz] style.

In 1987 when Mike Barnard left the band, [a=Barry Henderson] joined the band on bass while Mark Spalding played guitars. This line-up recorded the demo tape called [b][i]24 Hours[/i][/b] in November 1987 at Evenload Studios in East Kilbride. This was later combined with the mini album to form the band's only CD release under the french MSI label. Unfortunately, the quality of this release is very poor, being a direct transfer from vinyl, rather than master tapes. This is compounded by the fact that ""The Student Prince Part One"" has been omitted and replaced by an inferior version of a track from earlier on the disc.

A change of direction was heralded in in 1989 with the arrival of new lead vocalist [a=John Cowden], replacing Joe Cairney who went on to join the Fire Brigade. The demo tape [b][i]Hold On[/i][/b] was recorded at Evenload Studios (East Kilbride) in May '89. The band were playing more standard rock songs, which were more suited to the new vocalist. They played regularly around Scotland, and then quietly disappeared from view.

Remarkably though, the story does not end there, and in 2011 Comedy of Errors reformed. As the band's official website succinctly puts it:

""One man however kept faith in the original concept, dropped out of the prog scene completely, stayed in his room, kept writing new material and revising songs and waited.and waited.His name I don't recall but that's not important right now. Suffice to say it was hoped these mini-rock symphonies would, at some point in the future, see the light of day and find an appreciative audience. And so it was, thanks to those who kept faith in the music, the new incarnation of Comedy of Errors came to release their debut album [b][i]Disobey[/i][/b], a difficult birth, a long time in the making, but well worth the wait.""

Ceased activity: circa 1986.

A British instrumental quartet, Dif Juz consisted of brothers Dave & Alan Curtis (both guitarists), bassist Gary Bromley and drummer/occasional sax player Richard Thomas. In a recorded interview for Radiobombast (WRFI Community Radio, Ithaca, NY) Richard Thomas explained their name was a random result from use as a place-holder name for booking studio time, but they liked how people interpreted it in various ways. They released two seminal EPs; [r=381650] and [r=381643] in 1981 on the then fledgling 4AD label.  The band then departed 4AD for the label Red Flame in 1983 where they released an experimental mini LP [r=381598], following this they toured extensively through 1984 and 1985 supporting [a=Cocteau Twins] and [a=Wolfgang Press] before returning to 4AD to record their first full-length LP [r=383702] which featured contributions by Cocteau Twins Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) and Robin Guthrie (production). Shortly thereafter Dif Juz were introduced to Jamaican dub innovator [a=Lee Perry] and served as his backing band for a series of shows before eventually attempting to make a record together. The five tracks that were recorded - including a nine-minute version of ""The Mighty Quinn"" - never quite gelled, despite Robin Guthrie's attempts to mix them and the collaboration remains unreleased. 

With the exception of a reissued and re-recorded Huremics and Vibrating Air (respectively) in the form of [r=381633] and a contribution to the 1986 4AD compilation [r=159986] the band effectively disappeared, though the members remained active separately; the Curtis brothers and Ritchie Thomas both recorded parts for [a=This Mortal Coil]'s [r=184972] album, whilst Thomas would also appear that year on the Cocteau Twins/Harold Budd collaboration [r=77098] playing drums and saxophone. He and Dave Curtis also contributed to The Wolfgang Press' albums [r=260855] and [r=104397], respectively. 
It is rumoured that the band's 'final' dissolution came when Richard Thomas became a touring drummer for [a=The Jesus And Mary Chain], though the band never officially split up.

After many years of silence, the posthumous release by 4AD of Huremics and Vibrating Air appeared in the form of [r=237958] in 1999. Coinciding with the album was the creation of a website which appeared to be created by the band. This page ran the banner ""By us about us"", as well as ""More soon"" though this never materialized.

The group began as the backing band for British soul singer P.P. Arnold and also featured guitarist David O'List, drummer Ian Hague, and bassist Lee Jackson. In September 1967, only four months after formation, the group split from Arnold, replaced Hague with former Mark Leeman Five drummer Brian ""Blinky"" Davison, and released a single called ""The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack,"" which became the title track of their 1968 debut album. The Nice quickly built a reputation as an exciting, theatrical live band thanks to Emerson, who dressed in silver lame, hurled knives into his Hammond organ to produce strange sounds, and mimed masturbation onstage. Emerson's antics spawned controversy with an adaptation of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story song ""America."" The Nice performed it at the Royal Albert Hall while trying to burn a replica of an American flag, and Bernstein subsequently attempted to stop the song's release in the U.S., although it was released in edited form on the U.S. release of their second album Ars Longa Vita Brevis.

Emerson had emerged as the star of the group, both in terms of instrumental skill and showmanship, O'List, who had become erratic and unreliable had departed the group before the release of Ars Longa Vita Brevis to join the Misunderstood and subsequently Roxy Music. The reduction of the Nice to a trio allowed the band to further explore fusing rock with jazz and classical music, most notably with an adaptation of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No 3 titled ""Acceptance Brandenburger"".

Nice and Five Bridges became big hit albums in Britain, but the group never broke through in America. In 1969, Emerson met Greg Lake, then with King Crimson, on a U.S. tour, and broke up the Nice in frustration in 1970 due to its lack of success. He, Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer formed the much more popular Emerson, Lake and Palmer, which expanded on Emerson's innovations with the Nice. After the Nice, Lee Jackson formed Jackson Heights which recorded four albums between 1970-1973 and Brian Davison formed the short lived band Every Which Way and was in a mid 70's line up of Gong. Davison and Jackson formed Refugee with keyboardist Patrick Moraz, this was however short lived as the group disbanded after Moraz was invited to replace Rick Wakeman in Yes. In 2002 and 2003 Emerson, Jackson and Davison reunited for a one off Nice tour in the UK."
66025.0,42915.0,626487,US,Anthrax,Spreading The Disease,1985,43.67,9,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']",['Rock'],"['Thrash', 'Heavy Metal']","Thrash metal (heavy metal) band (1985-1990, 2004-present) and alternative rock (modern rock) band (1993-2003) from New York City, New York, United States.

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.

They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The line-up of the group was continually changing, and not all members could make it to every session. Occasionally there were guest musicians - including [a=Paul Kelday]! The 2 constant members were Phil Kelday, who distributed the tapes, and Heather Rolfe, who designed most of the covers.

The original line-up featured Dick Belly (vocals, guitar), Joe Markulin (guitar), Mel Pachuta (bass) and Mike Tatman (drums).

The Beinz began their professional career with a devoted local fanbase, recording covers of songs by Them, The Yardbirds, The Who and Bob Dylan. The group also released a version of “The Pied Piper” (originally recorded 3 years earlier by The Changin' Times and which later became a #1 hit for Crispian St. Peters). The group had a reputation as masters of song interpretation.

They signed to [l=Capitol Records] in 1967 and released their only Billboard Top 40 hit, “Nobody but Me” (first recorded by the Isley Brothers, who wrote it). “Nobody” peaked at #8 in January 1968. An album, Evolutions, followed. The Beinz’ next single, “Turn On Your Love Light,” flopped in the US (peaking at #80) but shot to #1 (for six weeks) in Japan and a tour followed. “Turn On Your Love Light” (a hit for Bobby Bland in 1962, and later covered by several artists, including Jerry Lee Lewis) featured “It’s Fun To Be Clean”, a snappy tune reminiscent of the Beatles’ Penny Lane, as the B-side. Later in 1968, Capitol released the single “Hold on Baby” only in Japan where it also hit the top of the charts. Despite their Nipponese success, the Human Beinz broke up soon thereafter.

In 2004, Quentin Tarantino used “Nobody But Me” on the soundtrack for his film Kill Bill: Vol. 1; also, the tune is featured on two compilation CDs: “ESPN’s The Greatest Crowd-Rockin’ Anthems Of All Time” and “J&R’s Music World Presents Rock And Roll’s Greatest Hits Of All Time”). The song made yet another appearance in Martin Scorcese’s 2006 film The Departed.

Currently, a group of four musicians (none of them original members) tour as the Human Beinz, having bought the rights to the name. The “new” Beinz play county fairs and other smaller venues in the Midwest and Northeast."

His birth name was James Bradford, which he changed to ""Nail"" after he stepped on a 15 centimeter spike in a glass factory.

In the late 1970s he sung in a Newcastle pub band called the King Crabs, more often than not wearing a woman's dress.

He rose to fame playing Leonard Jeffrey 'Oz' Osborne in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet in 1983.

Jimmy Nail has also starred in a number of films and had a long musical career, having been a singer before he was picked out at an audition to play Oz.

Nail spent six months in prison on a ""grievous bodily harm"" sentence following a drunken football match fight in his twenties

After the first two series of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, Nail found himself typecast and had no more major breaks until the detective series, Spender, which he co-wrote. This was followed by Crocodile Shoes, which also featured Nail as a musician. On the strength of his musical performances in the series he released a number of albums.

Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970's. Though often referred to as ""The Carpenters,"" their name on official releases and press materials was ""Carpenters."" During a period in the 1970's when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time.

Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, their parents decided to move the family west to Los Angeles, California. Richard and Karen originally played jazz, with Karen having an interest in playing the drums. They were briefly known as Spectrum and then Carpenters, where they then recorded for a small label, [l=Magic Lamp Records]. In their move West, they met Lou Adler who introduced them to [a=Herb Alpert], who signed them to his label, [l=A&M Records] in 1969.

While Richard penned compositions with writing partner, [a=John Bettis], many of the duos' hits were written by others and some were cover versions of established hits for other artists, such as [a=The Beatles] and Motown's, [a=The Marvelettes]. Their 1973 album, ""Now and Then."" B-side consists of a 9-song medley of 60's hits recorded like a radio show.

Carpenters' melodic pop, produced a record-breaking run of hits on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen #1 hits on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles (including their #1 hits). To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units.

During their 14-year career, Carpenters recorded 11 albums, five of which contained top 10 singles (""[m=84990],"" ""[m=84975],"" ""[m=84966],"" ""[m=85055]"" and ""[m=85013],"") thirty-one singles, five television specials, and one short-lived television series. They toured the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Belgium. Their recording career ended with Karen's death in 1983 from cardiac arrest due to complications of anorexia nervosa. Extensive news coverage of the circumstances surrounding her death increased public awareness of the consequences of eating disorders. "

Sharrock came out of retirement in the very early '80s when he met Bill Laswell, who brought him into the [a8796] fold, and later the free-rock-jazz-noise [a265435] quartet (with Ronald Shannon Jackson and Peter Brötzmann) between 1986 and 1990.

Angel Corpus Christi is a San Francisco singer/accordionist who began releasing vintage-sounding pop albums in the '80s. 
In 1984, Angel debuted with an album of NYC-related covers (by The Ramones, Lou Reed, etc.) called, fittingly,"" I Love New York."" 
""Wake Up & Cry,"" which primarily consisted of originals, emerged the following year, followed by 1987's ""Dim the Lights."" 
""Accordion Pop Vol. 1,"" a collection of accordion covers, came out in 1989. That same year saw the release of her first CD effort, ""The '80s,"" a collection that included both retrospective tracks and new material. 
Her husband, Rich Stim, a frequent musical co-conspirator, first became an important figure in avant/fringe rock in the mid-'70s with MX-80.

In 1995, Angel found herself on a mainstream label, Almo Sounds. That year she released the immensely catchy and fully realized ""White Courtesy Phone."" Producer-extraordinaire Craig Leon (The Ramones, Richard Hell, Blondie, Sir Douglas Quintet and way so much more) played keyboards and produced, while Almo head Herb Alpert added some guest trumpet to ""Lazy."" Legendary session percussionist/drummer Hal Blaine also shows up on the effort. 
Angel has also added accordion to the Spiritualized album ""Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space"" and collaborated with Luna's Dean Wareham on a cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Je T'aime (I Wanna Boogie With You)."" 

In 2005, she released ""Louie Louie,"" an album of Lou Reed covers (that also includes an original track, ""Lou Reed's Hair"" as well as a cover of the title track).

Later that year they were joined by [a260079] and [a336741] of [a286375].

The band was named by Kupferberg who borrowed it from the euphemistic substitute for the word “fuck” famously used in [a952953]’s novel, The Naked and the Dead. Incidentally, the band is featured in a chapter of Mailer’s book, Armies of the Night as they play at the 1967 march on the Pentagon in protest of the Vietnam War (with Scott Rashap on upright bass).

The Fugs were a satirical and self-satirizing rock band that performed at protests against the Vietnam War nationwide. Their 1968 Transatlantic Records album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Fugs-It-Crawled-Into-My-Hand-Honest/master/65618]It Crawled Into My Hand, Honest[/url] (TRA 181) also helped to make them more widely known on the European side of the Atlantic. This album (minus LP artwork, of course) can also be found as tracks 11 to 30 on [url=http://www.discogs.com/Fugs-Electromagnetic-Steamboat/release/626513]Electromagnetic Steamboat[/url]. The band’s frank lyrics about sex, drugs and politics aroused a hostile reaction in some quarters and enthusiastic interest in others. One of their better known songs was an adaptation of [a647247]’s poem, Dover Beach. Another was a [a568306] poem.

The Fugs played their “final” concert of the 1960s in 1969 at the Hersheypark Arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania with the [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Grateful+Dead%2C+The]Grateful Dead[/url].

Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768].

Matthews is an English musician and singer-songwriter. He was an original member of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention from 1967 to 1969 before leaving and forming his own band, Matthews Southern Comfort, which had a UK number one in 1970 with a cover version of Joni Mitchell's song ""Woodstock"". In 1971, Matthews recorded two solo albums on Vertigo and in 1972, under the sponsorship of former Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith, and surrounded by likeminded British semi-folkies (notably another ex-Fairporter, Richard Thompson), he formed Plainsong. After Plainsong collapsed due to a bandmate's alcohol problem, and with his career now based in Los Angeles, Matthews released several more albums with ad hoc bands. In 1979 his cover of Terence Boylan's ""Shake It"" reached No. 13 on the US charts. In 2000 Matthews moved to Amsterdam, where he became involved in independent music projects and collaborations, including the Sandy Denny tribute band No Grey Faith (an anagram of ""Fotheringay""). Since 2003 Matthews has worked with Dutch pianist and composer Egbert Derix. In January-February 2015 Matthews and Derix toured in California to promote the US releases of their albums; Dutch filmmakers Peter Jong and Olivier Hamaker made a documentary about the making of In The Now. In a career spanning over fifty years he has featured on over 100 albums and in 2018 published an autobiography co-written with author and broadcaster Ian Clayton, ""Thro’ My Eyes: A Memoir’’, about his life in the music industry."

Like his brother, he was afflicted with albinism - he was legally blind, and had 20/400 eyesight in one eye and 20/600 in the other, but he made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues. He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

Together with his brother, [a=Epic Soundtracks], [a=Nikki Sudden] formed what was to become [a=Swell Maps], releasing 4 singles and 2 albums on Rough Trade (UK) between 1977 and their break up in 1980. All these releases hit #1 in the UK Independent Charts. Swell Maps are remembered, particularly by similarly minded US based bands such as Sonic Youth, as pioneering exponents of the 'DIY Punk' school.
Sudden then began a solo career making two albums 'Waiting On Egypt' and 'The Bible Belt' before joining up with Birmingham guitarist, Dave Kusworth. The pair formed the Jacobites in 1983, going on to make two albums, 'Jacobites' and 'Robespierre’s Velvet Basement', the latter reaching No. 1 in the German Independent Charts. This tied in with their first German tour which lead to Sudden relocating there. 
When the Jacobites split in 1986, Sudden returned to his solo career with Creation Records, releasing five solo albums over the next five years: 'Texas', 'Dead Men Tell No Tales', 'Kiss You Kidnapped Charabanc' (with Rowland S. Howard), 'Groove' and a compilation, 'Back To The Coast'.
1990 found Sudden in Athens, Georgia, where sessions with [a=Peter Buck], [a=Mike Mills] and [a=Bill Berry (2)] from R.E.M. became the album 'The Jewel Thief' — later reissued as 'Liquor, Guns & Ammo'.
Kusworth and Sudden reformed The Jacobites in 1993, releasing three albums, 'Howling Good Times', 'Old Scarlett' and 'God Save Us Poor Sinners'. Their two original albums were reissued, as was a further compilation of rare tracks, 'Hawks Get Religion'. The band also released a limited edition, vinyl-only album, 'Kiss Of Life', in Germany, and a Spanish CD, 'Heart Of Hearts'.
In 1995, sessions in Chicago with members of the Chamber Strings and The Rosehips led to his seventh solo release 'Seven Lives Later'. This album featured musicians from The Jet Boys, The True Spirit, The Fatal Shore, Band Of Outsiders, Once Upon A Time, Vermooste Vløten, The Flaming Stars, Sonic Youth, Voodoo Witch, and The Jacobites.
Into the 2000's Sudden continued to tour extensively, playing around 100 shows per year, half with his backing band 'The Last Bandits' and half solo.
Nikki, with the Last Bandits, recorded his ninth solo release, 'Treasure Island', in England during summer 2002. Special guests include Ian McLagan (Small Faces, Faces), Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Anthony Thistlethwaite (Waterboys), Dave Kusworth (Jacobites) and Darrell Bath (Dogs D’Amour / Crybabys). The 'Treasure Island' release date was in 2004.
A retrospective, 'The Last Bandit (The Best Of Nikki Sudden)' was released by Glitterhouse Records in Europe, Wagging Dog Records in England, and Bomp Records in America, and features remastered and edited versions of  Sudden's most popular solo work.
Sudden's death in New York followed a number of solo performances in the USA after which a short European tour by The Jacobites had been scheduled. The first of these dates, on 29th March 2006 at London's '12 Bar Club', took place but was transformed into a tribute to Nikki Sudden's memory and featured a number of musicians with whom he had played.

In 2008, Turner came out of semi-retirement and embarked on her ""Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour"" - one of the largest ticket-sales tours of that year. 'Rolling Stone' magazine has hailed her as ""One of the greatest singers of all time"", reaching unprecedented heights in stadium-filling Rock."

Initially began his career as a session drummer, but quickly moved on and joined [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Graham+Bond+Organization%2C+The]The Graham Bond Organisation[/url] in 1966, with whom he stayed until 1968, when he briefly joined [a299538], before forming his own act, [a97325], with [a249817], and [a268714].

Colosseum were reformed in 1994 for a reunion gig, and have toured several times since. On the death of  Dick Heckstall-Smith in 2004, Barbara Thompson, who had been in the various line-ups of Colosseum, joined as a permanent member replacing him on saxophone.

Hiseman's biography, by Martyn Hanson, was released in October 2010 entitled 'Playing The Band'.

1979 RFATP were joined by [a=Nathan McGough] (bass) and [a=Phil Hurst] (drums), and Mike Keane took over vocals, guitar and keyboards. Played at the Moonlight Club in London supporting Joy Division.
By 1980 Phil Hurst left to join Hollycaust and was replaced by [a=Donald Johnson].

The end of 1981 and into the following year saw the Royal Family revert back to the original duo, playing their final gig at Plato's Ballroom (which Arthur & Nathan had set up as a venue).

In 1985, The Royal Family & The Poor left Factory Records and Mike Keane formed his own record label, Gaia Communications World Network.

1986 saw Jeff, Karen and Kif depart and to be replaced by Paula Simms (vocals), [a=John Metcalfe] (violin) and Judith Laity (cello). Touring Holland.

In 1987 RFATP recruites [a=Simon Crab] (vocals, keyboards), [a=Merlin Shepherd] (saxophone), [a=Andy Frizell] (bass). Band toured Germany & Belgium.
Pete Fuck (aka Pic Meter, Peter Jones, Cosmic) played keyboards in 1987 (then aged 19), but didn’t do any gigs.

German for ""fist"", and also the protagonist of Goethe's eponymous play, Faust were among the first bands to use the recording studio as an instrument and one of the originators & central pillars of the Krautrock genre. After two albums for Polydor, they were dropped due to a lack of commercial success and signed with the fledgling Virgin label. The first release to come of this new partnership was The Faust Tapes - a record comprised of edited older material, with no clearly demarcated tracks, and no titles or other information on the sleeve. In what could be seen as an early attempt at viral marketing, the disc was priced as a single and as a result sold over 50,000 copies. Faust IV was released later the same year, and had been recorded on night shifts at the label's Manor studio while Mike Oldfield tracked Tubular Bells during the day. While the group would carry on for another two years after the release of IV, no new releases appeared before the band seemingly vanished.

Throughout the 1980s the group's first three records and various unreleased archival material were released by Chris Cutler's ReR and Recommended labels - the beginning of a creative partnership which would see him go on to perform with Jean-Hervé Peron's later iteration of the group decades later. Beginning in 1994 Faust reactivated; performing live in the UK and Europe and releasing a new album, Rien, on Table Of The Elements. They would go on to tour and record extensively, with the majority of their later work being released on H.J. Irmler's Klangbad label until the group fractured into two distinct lineups in 2004. Their live appearances during both their 70s and 90s periods were infamous for their chaotic physicality and the risks often posed to the band and audience alike, with pinball machines, jackhammers, cement mixers and blowtorches all being common onstage props and sound sources."

Kirk] and [a=Stephen Mallinder] at [a=Cabaret Voltaire]'s [l=Western Works] studio and mixed and engineered by Alan Cross, a member of the band who had studio training. The track reached No. 3 in the UK Indie Chart in the Autumn of 1984. The next single [url=http://www.discogs.com/Chakk-You-They-Say/master/108850]""You"" / ""They Say""[/url], released on their own [l=FON Records] label the following March, was also an Indie Chart top 10 and lead to publishing and recording deals with MCA Music and [l=MCA Records].

The size of the advance they got from MCA Records is something of a legend since it was large enough to finance the building of Sheffield's first large commercial recording studio, [l=FON Studios], completed in the summer of 1985. The studio was designed by Alan Cross, Mark Brydon, and Marcus O'Hagan, a friend of the band. The three had backgrounds in Architecture.

Chakk's original sound was centred around Alan Cross' four track tape machine, some home built echo and effects boxes and a small mixing desk. They had always believed that the most important instrument a band could use was the studio itself. 

FON became a successful commercial studio after the recording of Chakk's 1986 album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Chakk-10-Days-In-An-Elevator/master/108854]""Ten Days in an Elevator""[/url], and was a focal point for local sound engineering talent. [a=Robert Gordon], [a=Alan Fisch], [a=Steve Cobby], and [a=Phil Jones (5)], to name just a few, all spent time honing their skills there. Alan Cross used various pseudonyms such as [a=D.J. Chakk] and [a=Alana Gold] to record, produce and remix other acts at FON outside of his role in Chakk.

Chakk left MCA after their album failed to sell in sufficient quantities to satisfy the record label accountants and, back on the FON label, released the [url=http://www.discogs.com/Chakk-Timebomb/master/108863]""Timebomb""[/url] EP in autumn 1986.

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.
 
Genesis P-Orridge died after a long battle with leukaemia on 14th March 2020."

The music evolved away from the psychedelic sound of the Allen-led era into jazz/rock fusion.  By the time Expresso II (1978) was recorded Moerlen had assembled an almost entirely different group with a very different sound.  With the completion of Gong's contract with Virgin Records the group name was changed to Pierre Moerlen's Gong to differentiate it from the other Gong offshoots and the original band.

Pierre Moerlen's Gong released four albums for Arista Records between 1979 and 1981 (Downwind, Time Is The Key, Live, and Leave It Open) which are widely regarded as their classics.  The band had a distinctive sound dominated by the heavy use of mallet instruments (marimba, xylophone, vibraphone and glockenspiel) played mainly by Pierre Moerlen, his brother [a=Benoit Moerlen], and [a=François Causse].  After being dropped by Arista the band broke up.

In the mid '80s Pierre Moerlen and bassist [a=Hansford Rowe], who had played on the previous four albums, put together a new incarnation of the band featuring several members of the Swedish band [a=Tribute (5)] including guitarist [a=Åke Ziedén].  They released the Scientology-inspired album Breakthrough (1986), mainly pop tunes plus a few fusion tracks.  Shortly thereafter Tribute broke up but Ziedén remained and Benoit rejoined the group.  The new lineup returned to the original jazz/rock fusion sound and recorded two further albums: Second Wind (1989) and Full Circle - Live 1988 before disbanding again.  In 2002 Moerlen recorded an album in St. Petersburg (Russia) with a group of Russian musicians called Pentanine. The last album of the Pierre Moerlen's Gong was started in 2005 with another new line-up of young French musicians, but Moerlen died suddenly leaving the project at a very early stage. The band nevertheless decided to record Pierre's last compositions with some of their own, and release it posthumously as 'Tribute' in 2010. "

The competition had a panel of judges including: Noddy Holder (Slade), Mick Karn (Japan), Roy Wood (The Move & Wizard), Angie Bowie and representitives from Melody Maker & NME.
ithin 12 months the lineup had changed to: Rob Fennah - (Guitars & Vocals), Alan Fennah - (Percussion & Vocals), Steve Barratt - (Bass), Kevin Roberts - (Keys). They signed a recording contract with EMI Parlophone in 1983 and their debut single 'Valley of Evergreen' was released in January 1984.

The record made the top 100 and received good reviews. The follow up, ‘First Night’ was recorded but, horror of horrors, EMI didn’t like it. They said it wouldn’t pick up national radio play! The band left EMI in the summer of 1985 and signed to Cold Harbour Records. They put the single out instead and in 1986 ‘First Night’ went straight onto the Radio 1 play list. (One in the eye for EMI – The A&R guy responsible lost his job). Trouble was, being a small indie label, Cold Harbour struggled to get records into the shops quickly enough and this reflected in the chart position. The band recorded a Radio 1 session for Janice Long the same year.

1986 also saw the release of 'First Night', the album & a stage play of the same name written by Rob & Alan together with friend and journalist Mark Thomas.

In 1987 they released 'Strangers in Love' on the 'Towerbell' record label. A second Radio 1 session followed for Simon Mayo and the band was voted ‘ Best Session Of The Year’. A re-issue of 'Valley of Evergreen' was released by Cold Harbour Records. This was limited edition and had a distinctive GREEN sleeve. It has now become a rare & collectable item.

1988 saw the release of ""Swing Out"" followed by ""Change of Heart"". Both singles did well from a radio point of view but (and this is where it starts getting silly) their record company PRT went bust! So, after another fiasco, the brothers decided that - if they were going to release another single - it would be on their own label.

In 1990, The band experimented with a different style of music and a hectic dance track FALLOUT was released on their PULSE RECORDS label. The track was based on the 1960's cult television series ""THE PRISONER"" which starred Patrick McGoohan as an ex-secret agent who is taken prisoner and exiled in a strange village. The single featured outtakes from the series and became an instant club hit. This record is now a collectors item (see record collector)

Alternative Radio

In 1991- 93, The band were concentrating on writing the script & music for a musical play ""Twopence to Cross the Mersey"". It was premiered at the Liverpool Empire Theatre and became an instant hit. One critic describled it as ‘The best show to come out of Liverpool since Blood Brothers’. At the invitation of The Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, the band was asked to perform the songs from the show at the Philharmonic with members of the orchestra. They released a compilation album called ""Retrospect"" which featured all their singles from 1983 - 1990. The band also released the soundtrack from ""Twopence to Cross the Mersey"". In July 1995 an acoustic album entitled 'Wood, Wire & Skin' followed, together with a single 'Across the Universe' .

1996 – Present day, Alternative Radio (Rob and Alan Fennah) continued to write music for Television, Film and Theatre. Their last album entitled ‘Subject to Status’ was released in 2004. Current projects include the re-launch of 'Twopence to Cross the Mersey', The sequel, 'By The Waters Of Liverpool' and an original stageplay entitled ‘Lennon's Banjo’.  In the meantime, there is an official YT channel where most of the music is put for the people to hear (including new releases). Both brothers have recently issued solo albums. Alan Fennah 'Alone' (2020) and 'Wanderlust' (2021). Rob Fennah 'Junction39' (2021).

Their debut single, ""Storm"" reached No. 1 in the UK independent chart and Carmel was signed immediately to London Records. Their second album The Drum is Everything (produced by Mike Thorne) drew some praise. Parris and Darby conjured the effect of a full ensemble backing to McCourt's vocals, and alternated between soulful ballads, gospel, blues and jazz. The resulting singles ""Bad Day"" and ""More, More, More"" both went Top 25 in the UK Singles Chart. The following album, The Falling (produced by Brian Eno, Hugh Jones and David Motion) made Carmel moderately successful in France, achieving gold disc status, as well as charting in Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands. Carmel had a hit in France with ""J'oublierai ton nom"", a duo with France's Johnny Hallyday. ""Sally"" the first single lifted from the album sold 500,000 copies in France alone.

With the critical and commercial success awarded both The Falling and the next album Everybody's Got A Little Soul, record producers were keen to work with Carmel.

1989 saw the release of Set Me Free, with Brian Eno and Pete Wingfield adding their touches to the material. A five star review in Q describing the album as ""incendiary"".1990's 'best of' compilation, Collected, put the band's career into perspective.

1992's Good News saw Carmel moving to East West Records with Parris producing. In 1997 Ronnie Scotts provided the venue to record their last album, Live at Ronnie Scotts, which was a collection of their work and some previously unreleased material.

Live performance has always been central to Carmel's work and they are successful on the European touring circuit, and has sometimes found greater appreciation on the continent than it has done in the UK. The French christened McCourt the new Edith Piaf, and in Italy she won the accolade of Best Jazz vocalist at the Messina Festival.

During much of the 1990s the band members were living between Barcelona, Paris and Manchester, and it was hard for them to work together, so they pursued other musical projects. Parris created the band Nzi Dada with Paris based multi media artist Xumo Nounjio, and Carmel worked on various projects as a singer, writer and teacher.

The start of the millennium saw them all back in their adopted hometown of Manchester, but Darby decided he no longer wanted to continue. In 2002 Parris and McCourt undertook a tour playing the old material with a nine piece band. Later they worked on material for a new album with drummer Brice Wassy."

By the time they began releasing records under their own name in the 1980s, the band's humanist tendencies came to the fore, with astounding portraits of people on the periphery, resulting in such classics as Rosemary Smith, Mad Dot and Don't Stick Knives In Babbies Heads. The sharp sensibilities of founder and leader Johny Brown eventually led to a star-making deal with Rough Trade, a few near hits and career momentum shattered when the label collapsed mere days after what might have been the band's breakthrough album.

Slowly, a new Band Of Holy Joy has blossomed. Despite all the expected rock 'n roll trappings - Great shows! Killer tunes! Special guests! - the band operate, well, differently. In some aspects, they're an art collective. Inspired by the possibilities which burst forth after punk, the band's expression takes many forms. Visual artist Inga Tillere plays a large role in shaping the band's aesthetic and live events, and in musical foil James Stephen Finn, Mark Beazkley and Peter Smith, Johny's poetic vision transcends expectations without resorting to desperate reaches into esoterica.

In 2017, they released FUNAMBULIST WE LOVE YOU, a literary examination of the malaise set forth by Brexit, Trump, the rise of the far-right and a general disenfranchisement from most post-war liberal values. It rarely names any names, and it's far from strident, but it's undeniably a record forged by 2017.

The Band Of Holy Joy 2019 model is a sleek beat outfit that owes as much to indie music in the proper sense of indie as it does to the Brechtian connotations of past Band Of Holy Joy incarnations. They have lineage but never dwell on it preferring to forge forward. They have a history too but never let it drag them back. For the past few years they have been quietly growing and gestating and now they have emerged fully reborn with renewed purpose of sound and vision.

From their ""free-rock"" beginnings in the nascent ""krautrock"" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional ""rock"" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.

Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the ""krautrock"" twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and ""freak out jamming"" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the ""Berlin School"". Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.

After a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. [a=Paul Haslinger] replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son [a=Jerome Froese] in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own [l=TDI Music] label (later renamed [l=Eastgate]), TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate—father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories—but the group's artistic direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members."

Although he enjoyed success with ""Bat Out of Hell"" and ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell"" and earned a Grammy Award for 'Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance' for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native US. However, he retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for the number of weeks overall spent on the charts as of 2006. He ranked 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

He was one of the best-selling artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million copies.

Initially formed as a trio called ""Genesis,"" then ""Mammoth,"" in 1972 (Eddie on guitar and lead vocals, Alex on drums, Mark Stone on bass), and renamed ""Van Halen"" by David Lee Roth (ex-Red Ball Jets), who joined the band in 1973 after Mammoth had rented a PA system from him. Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

In 2019, further reunion plans were discussed, but the band ended upon the death of Eddie Van Halen on October 6, 2020.

John Christoforou) and drummer Milan Zekavica. 

The seeds for the formation of The Escape Club were sown when Zekavica joined Steel and Holliday in Mad Shadows, who subsequently performed on an album by the obscure early 1980s Stephen Milford-fronted new wave outfit Planning by Numbers.

Before long, Christo had also joined the lineup, and The Escape Club was born and the fledgling band quickly released the single ""Breathing"".

In 1985 The Escape Club signed with EMI and recorded the album White Fields, which was released the following year. 

In 1987, the group moved to Atlantic Records and began recording their next album, Wild Wild West, and the album was released in the summer of 1988 and spawned the single ""Wild, Wild West"", which climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart while the song's video received major rotation on MTV, however, it was banned from British Television for unclear reasons.

In 1989, they released two more singles from Wild Wild West: ""Shake for the Sheik"", which climbed to No. 28, and ""Walking Through Walls"", which peaked at No. 81.

The Escape Club's cover single of The Doors' ""20th Century Fox"" appeared on The Wonder Years: Music From the Emmy Award-Winning Show & Its Era, which also received airplay on MTV. The song was produced by Doors band member Ray Manzarek.

In 1990 the band returned to the studio to record their final album, Dollars and Sex, which saw a March 1991 release. The first single, ""Call It Poison"", failed to crack the US Top 40. 

Atlantic Records then released the song ""I'll Be There"", which the group said was heavily influenced by the death of a friend's wife, and the song has become an anthem among those who have experienced losses of their own. 

""I'll Be There"" reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and achieved gold status in the US.The group disbanded in 1992. 

The Escape Club is the only British band to have a No. 1 hit in the U.S. while not charting at all in their native UK.

The band self-released a fourth album ""Cloud 10"" in 2005.

Trevor Steel and John Holliday reunited, with new band member Red Broad, in 2009 and self-released a fifth studio album, Celebrity, in February 2012.

In 2019, Johnnie Christo returned to the line-up and the Escape Club played as a full band for the first time in 25 years during the U.S. tour Lost 80s Live. "

The latter was sufficiently successful to attract major-label interest from CBS and Virgin Records, but after a further single on their own 'Chant' label, and with guitarist Simon Childs added as a permanent member, they signed a deal with Warners subsidiary Blanco y Negro, debuting on the label in 1986 with eight versions of the single ""Sing Song"".[1] After releasing the Spacemate package - a double LP, book, poster, set of cards and instruction manual, packaged together in a soap box container and designed by Jon Wozencroft, the band moved on to indie label Rough Trade Records, where they would stay for the rest of their career. Their fondness for remixes was evident on their first Rough Trade release, a 7-inch EP featuring eight, 1 minute songs and titles ""Autumn Cut Back Job Lot Offer"", released in early 1987.

After three albums with Ariola-Hansa, they switched to Virgin Records in 1980 and found their fortunes dramatically improving thanks to the surge of popularity in the New Romantic movement.

Rob Dean left the band after Gentlemen Take Polaroids but continued working with the band for one more tour thereafter.

Disagreements between Karn and Sylvian undermined the band's progress just as they were achieving some long-overdue success, and they split in late 1982.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015. The ZFT produced numerous posthumous releases and remasters of the back catalog.

Angel Corpus Christi is a San Francisco singer/accordionist who began releasing vintage-sounding pop albums in the '80s. 
In 1984, Angel debuted with an album of NYC-related covers (by The Ramones, Lou Reed, etc.) called, fittingly,"" I Love New York."" 
""Wake Up & Cry,"" which primarily consisted of originals, emerged the following year, followed by 1987's ""Dim the Lights."" 
""Accordion Pop Vol. 1,"" a collection of accordion covers, came out in 1989. That same year saw the release of her first CD effort, ""The '80s,"" a collection that included both retrospective tracks and new material. 
Her husband, Rich Stim, a frequent musical co-conspirator, first became an important figure in avant/fringe rock in the mid-'70s with MX-80.

In 1995, Angel found herself on a mainstream label, Almo Sounds. That year she released the immensely catchy and fully realized ""White Courtesy Phone."" Producer-extraordinaire Craig Leon (The Ramones, Richard Hell, Blondie, Sir Douglas Quintet and way so much more) played keyboards and produced, while Almo head Herb Alpert added some guest trumpet to ""Lazy."" Legendary session percussionist/drummer Hal Blaine also shows up on the effort. 
Angel has also added accordion to the Spiritualized album ""Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space"" and collaborated with Luna's Dean Wareham on a cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Je T'aime (I Wanna Boogie With You)."" 

In 2005, she released ""Louie Louie,"" an album of Lou Reed covers (that also includes an original track, ""Lou Reed's Hair"" as well as a cover of the title track). 

2010 finds a new Angel release, ""Elvis Elvis,"" a loving tribute of reinterpreted/re-contextualized covers of the King's most memorable songs. angel delivers a decidedly downbeat performance of these songs with solid intentions: Time to hear Elvis in a new and quiet way!"

The band are huge fans of Tranmere Rovers FC, and once turned down the chance to appear on the Channel 4 80`s rock show The Tube, as Tranmere were playing that night.
The musical styles often parody simple popular genres, while the lyrics are dense with cultural allusions, usually (but not exclusively) UK popular culture. For instance, the interpretation of the title of the band's first album, Back in the DHSS (1985), requires three items of background information: that the Beatles wrote a song called ""Back in the USSR""; that the DHSS was the UK state welfare agency, and that at that time unemployment stood at high levels. 
The humour of HMHB draws on 1970s and early 1980s popular culture, and in particular children's programmes. Hence, HMHB 'borrowed' wholesale from Trumpton and turned a song about being the driver of a train into an ode to hard and soft drug use.

Judie Myers was born in London to an English mother and a Polish extract father. After an education in the arts, music and drama, by the age of 15 Judie spent most of her time writing poems which she turned into songs and playing folk clubs, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. In 1975 she met [a=Mike Paxman] and together they started to write the songs that were to become her first releases. After making some demo tapes, they managed to get a record deal with David Bowie and T.Rex producer [a=Tony Visconti]'s label [l=Good Earth].

Judie decided to change her name back to her family's original surname, Tzuke. A single was released: ""[m=669261]"", which was recorded and produced by Tony Visconti and came out under the name of ""Tzuke and Paxo"". In 1977, Judie was signed to [a=Elton John]'s [l=Rocket Records (15)].

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs.

Born as Farrokh Pluto Bulsara to Parsi parents Bomi and Jer Bulsara, he attended St. Peter's boarding school near Bombay and formed his first school band (""The Hectics"") where he played piano.
At age 17 the Bulsara family fled to England during the Zanzibar revolution and Freddie (as he began calling himself) took up studies in art design. He also formed a band called ""Ibex"" (later renamed to ""Wreckage"") but they failed to take off. Soon after he joined another band called ""Sour Milk Sea"" but it also disbanded. 

In 1970 he met [a=Brian May] and [a=Roger Taylor] who at the time were going under the name [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Smile+(6)]Smile[/url]. Quickly taking full charge, he changed the name to ""[a=Queen]"", and with his art design education designed the band's logo. It was also around this time that he changed his name to Frederick Mercury by deed poll.

As flamboyant a performer he was on stage, Mr. Mercury was equally adept at songwriting; it was his ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that propelled the band to superstardom.

Between the late 1970's and early 1980's, Freddie took a break from the band to pursue a solo career, spending much time in Munich and New York. In 1987 he was diagnosed with HIV. Despite his illness he still recorded with Queen to finish one last album (""[r=889990]"") and his last recorded song, ""Mother Love"" (which was to appear on the posthumous ""[r=1383329]"" album). As the disease took hold, public appearances and subsequent videos revealed a very thin Freddie -- yet he insisted on keeping his illness a secret. 

On 24 November 1991, he died in his Kensington home, one day after announcing his illness, aged 45.

Steve Whitehouse: Vocals and Upright Bass
Steve Eaton: Guitars
Adam Seviour: Drums

Frenzy are a 3 piece band, formed in the August of 1983, during the successful revival of the Rock-a-Billy music scene around that time. Steve Whitehouse, the founder member of the group, had already found success with his previous two outifts, most notably ' The Sharks ', another 3 piece Rock-a-Billy band who had released an album and various other ditties since their formation in 1981. Indeed, Steve has been actively involved in music since 1980. Citing musical differences, Steve left The Sharks to pursue his destiny with Frenzy.

Frenzy came to be in a music shop in Bristol, when Steve and an old friend, Simon Brand, were playing around with guitars and double basses one Saturday afternoon. Steve, 17 at the time, approached Simon about playing guitar and the rest, as they say, is history. Using old contacts and a new demo tape, Frenzy soon clinched an album deal and commenced recording on the first of ten albums to date. Merv Pepler, now of Ozric Tentacles and Eat Static fame, completed the line-up on drums.

The 3 piece soon found out they had strong song-writing abilities, creating early anthems like Robot Riot, Hall Of Mirrors, Frenzy, Cry or Die and Sweet Money. The group soon found themselves propelled to the top of their scene. Mostly bypassing support slots, Frenzy became a headlining act within a year of forming, making regular trips to London and other major U.K. cities. On top of all this, the agency that took The Sharks into Europe took Frenzy on, arranging sell-out club dates throughout Holland and Germany.

Frenzy's popularity had not gone un-noticed by some of the larger independent record labels, and soon Frenzy had been signed by ID Records in London. The new album, ' Clockwork Toy ', hit the independent charts like a rocket, and the single, ' I See Red ', went Top 10 in 3 weeks. Reaching a high spot of number 3, the single remained in the top 30 for 27 weeks. The album hit Number 8 and stayed there for 6 weeks, during which time Radio 1 picked up on Frenzy's success and played I See Red no less than 21 times. Spun by DJ's such as Janice Long, John Peel, Andy Kershaw, Bruno Brooks and Steve Wright.

In a career spanning 20 years, Frenzy have tasted the big time touring the world, reaching places such as Holland, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain. Radio and T.V. appearances became commonplace, and a deal was signed in Japan for simultaneous releases of Frenzy albums in both Japan and North America.

The band has undergone several line-up changes over the years. Musicians have come and gone as they do, and inevitably a little influence of each band member has stayed, making Frenzy a rich mixture of musical cultures. It is safe to say the group still uses the Rock-a-Billy thing as it's foundation, but also Blues, Heavy Rock and Punk can be heard. The music scene has changed but Frenzy are still going strong. In December of 2002, Frenzy released their 10th album, ' Dirty Little Devils ', an album they are most proud of. Twelve classic Frenzy tracks that have received much critical acclaim. The band have not heard a single negative comment from anybody. The whole package is selling like hot cakes. Currently the trio are recording their 11th album, a 21st anniversary special addition cd, and are still making regular trips abroad to headline festivals.


Steve Whitehouse has been dubbed ' King of the Slap Bass ' by followers and peers alike, and backs up his playing abilities with a powerful voice and energetic live performance. Steve recently took part in a Terence Higgins Trust Aids Project, which saw him contributing his bass playing to an album which included Sham '69, Sting, Elton John, The Revillo's, The Meteors and many others. Now back with The Sharks as well, Steve say's, "" I just can't leave music alone.....it's in the blood, being on stage is what i live for.....""

Steve Eaton has been with the band 5 years. He is an accomplished guitarist, who also plays for Punk outfit ' Far-Cue '. Steve has played for a number of different styled bands, which has given him a rich insight into a variety of different techniques. His input into Frenzy is invaluble. On stage he is a man possessed, and off stage has struck up a great song-writing partnership with Steve Whitehouse.

Rob Chapman has been playing drums for 17 years and comes from a varied musical background. He has played Soul, Rock n Roll, and Heavy Rock with his last venture before joining Frenzy, being part of a comedy trio, ' Stumpy, Ginge and Tubs ', a skillful musical unit who were much in demand. Rob has been a member of Frenzy since May 2002, and as well as being a solid player, provides much welcomed comic relief whilst on the road.

[a=Frank Zappa] teamed with gigging R&B group 'The Soul Giants' in 1964. The band included vocalist [a=Ray Collins], bassist [a=Roy Estrada] and drummer [a=Jimmy Carl Black]. Zappa emerged as their creative leader and the band became 'The Mothers' (as in mother-f**kers = good musicians). After signing to [l=Verve Records] this was changed to 'The Mothers Of Invention' at the insistence of the label. Until Zappa founded his own label the appendage was usually added in mock deference and the band were usually referred to as 'The Mothers'.

Guitarist [a=Elliot Ingber] then joined and, for much of their seminal 1960's albums, the group also included woodwind player [a=Bunk Gardner], saxophonist [a=Motorhead Sherwood], keyboardist [a=Don Preston], multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian Underwood] and additional drummers [a=Billy Mundi] and [a=Art Tripp]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Freak Out!"" (1966), ""Absolutely Free"" and ""We're Only In It For The Money"" (1967), ""Cruising With Ruben & the Jets"" (1968) and ""Uncle Meat"" (1969).
During Zappa's jazz/classical rock period of 1969-1970, his works were augmented by violinists [a=Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris] and [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], percussionist [a=Ruth Underwood] and drummers [a=Aynsley Dunbar] and [a=John Guerin]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Uncle Meat"", ""Hot Rats"", ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"" and ""Burnt Weeny Sandwich"". 

From 1970-72, Zappa formed a new line-up with former [a48408] members [a=Flo & Eddie] and bassist [a=Jim Pons]. Preston, Underwood and Dunbar remained in the line-up, along with additional keyboardist [a=George Duke]. This line-up was disbanded, after Zappa was pushed from the stage by a fan in 1972. (He could not tour for the next year). Two more jazz rock albums, ""Waka Jawaka"" and ""The Grand Wazoo"", were recorded with much of the previous jazz-rock group including Preston, Ian and Ruth Underwood, Dunbar, Ponty, Guerin and Duke. Trumpeter [a=Sal Marquez] was also added. Zappa and the band went back to vocal rock songs with jazz elements in 1973 on ""Over-Nite Sensation"", then 1974's ""Apostrophe"" and 1975's ""One Size Fits All"". Much of the same band remained, along with new members [a2636463] (trombone), [a=Tom Fowler] (bass) and [a=Napoleon M. Brock] (saxophone). In 1975 Zappa called a halt to this backing band. By the late '70s an entirely new support band was formed, with only occasional participation from past members, including a re-appearance of [a=Captain Beefheart]. Beginning in the 80's, past 'Mothers' members Collins, Black, Gardner, Sherwood, Preston, Tom and Bruce Fowler occasionally played in a mock Zappa band, 'The Grandmothers'. In 1985 Zappa adroitly used 'The Mothers Of Prevention' in his assault on American censorship aspects of the music industry.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

The Apostles were an experimental post-punk band who developed within the confines of the 1980s Anarcho Punk scene in the UK, but did not necessarily adhere to the aesthetics of that movement. 

Although the core of the group remained stable, Andy Martin and Dave Fanning were joined by various members over their 10 year span. Variation was also key in music styles as they varied from pop to punk to industrial through to pure experimentation, with influences like The Velvet Underground, The Adverts, Alternative TV, Lemon Kittens, The Pop Group and Twelve Cubic Feet cited. 

Although highly critical of the seemingly inward looking anarchist movement of the times, the autonomous and libertarian approach of The Apostles seemed to portray classic anarchism, as opposed to the conformity of many of their contemporaries. This led to much respect from notable members of the original anarcho-punk movement such as Crass with whom the band co-operated during the squatting of the Zig-Zag Club and running of [l=The Autonomy Centre] and [l=Centro Iberico] venues, and Conflict who released a single and album by The Apostles on their Mortarhate label. 

Originally formed in 1980 by William Corbett, Julian Portinari, Dan MacIntyre and Pete Bynghall, the band came into its own when Andy Martin joined to contribute lead vocals and lyrics. Shortly afterwards he was joined by Dave Fanning, ex-Innocent Bystander bassist. During this period the band recorded numerous DIY demo cassettes. In 1983 The Apostles released their first 7"" single and were joined by 14 year old Scottish drummer Chris Low, ex-Political Asylum. It is from this time that The Apostles have been described as having started their 'proper recording career', releasing four classic singles, the best of which are shortly to see a long overdue re-release on CD, plus numerous full-length albums and further cassette releases.

The Apostles split up in 1989, immediately forming [a=Academy 23] who released a number of works. Andy Martin & Dave Fanning continued as [a=Unit (6)] although Dave Fanning left Unit in 2007, leaving Andy Martin and Colin Murrell as the only members of Apostles in UNIT."

They emerged from Southern California to gain international prominence, touring enough to become a major attraction in virtually every city where a scene existed and undoubtedly inspiring others to get in the game. Via the band's SST label, Black Flag played an essential role in the development and popularization of American punk. Through countless revolving-door personnel changes — which spawned numerous spin-off bands along the way — Black Flag persevered until 1986, finally dissolving after locating and exploring the zone where punk and heavy metal intersect and overlap.

Guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn founded Black Flag in 1976 along with vocalist Keith Morris. They were initially called Panic, adopting the Black Flag moniker a few years later. Ginn remained the only constant member in the band until their split in the summer of 1986. In 2003, Ginn resurrected the Black Flag for a couple shows to benefit cat rescue organizations. These shows featured contributions from some old members as well as new players and reactions were mixed. In January 2013, Ginn announced that he was relaunching the band with vocalist Ron Reyes (the second of 4 vocalists to pass through the group in its initial run) with the intention of extensive touring and recording new material. At the same time, Keith Morris and one-time bassist and SST Records co-founder Chuck Dukowski launched Flag, which also featured former members Bill Stevenson and Dez Cadena as well as Descendents/ALL guitarist Stephen Egerton, to perform the music of Black Flag."

Born on 8 May 1944 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, Gadd started his recording career as [a809714] in 1960, although a succession of singles under this name (and later as Paul Monday) made little impact. In 1971, with management by [a224754], he jumped on the glam bandwagon, releasing the single ""Rock N Roll"" under the name Gary Glitter. It reached the top ten in both the UK and USA. Although his only major hit state-side, it was the first of many in the UK, under the guidance of [l364229].

Glitter's releases were, for the most part, fairly basic, but were made successful by his bravado and strutting showmanship. The hits dried up in the mid-70s, though he remained in the public eye via live performances and a 1984 comeback ""Another Rock N Roll Christmas"", as well as being sampled by (and appearing on TV with) The Timelords for their 1988 chart-topper ""Doctorin' The Tardis"". He went into semi-retirement in the 1990s, putting most of his musical energy into his annual Christmas gigs. However, his musical career ceased in 2000 after a 1999 conviction for child pornography.

On 5 February 2015, Gadd was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under the age of 13, between 1975 and 1980. He was sentenced, on 27 February, to 16 years imprisonment.

[l=Snapper Music] has owned the master rights to Glitter's recordings since February 1997 and he is not entitled to any royalties or other monies from the catalogue.

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

But at the end of the decade, Starr recorded one of the most unknown American hard rock albums of the era, the self-titled ""Jack Starr's Burning Starr"", named by the fans as ""The Orange album"".
This album set a departure from the band's hard 'n heavy style into a more commercial sound, full of keyboards and catchiness.
""Send Me An Angel"", ""Love Can't Wait"", ""Fool For Love"" or ""Hold Back The Night"" could have been huge hits on the radio. Sadly, it was a little too late when the album came out (almost 1990) and the labels started to drop artists playing this kind of stuff.
The album only was released in Japan and Germany, but with no promotion and poor distribution it went unnoticed to the major audience.

Arising out of adolescent garage band the Primitives, which played primitive covers of British Invasion tunes, the New Primitives came together in New York City in 1966, originally composed of a group of high school friends: Ray Rifice (guitar), Tommy Nikosy (guitar), Rob Buckman (drums), and Mike Garrigan (vocals). Soon, the band increased to a group of five with the addition of bassist/organist Gus Riozzi. 

They kept a busy performance schedule throughout the next few years when their high school commitments allowed it. In 1968, Rifice left the band to attend college, but at about the same time, former '50s crooner turned manager Johnny Mann saw the band live and promised to get them a recording contract. Philip Polimeni replaced Rifice on lead guitar, and the New Primitives became Majic Ship. Mann introduced the band to the Tokens, who produced their first single, ""Night Time Music."" It became a local hit, even gaining the band some national airplay, as did a second single, ""Hummin."" 

After much touring and a couple more singles, Majic Ship found their way to a studio to record their self-titled debut album in the summer of 1969. Majic Ship melded hard rock, pop, and psychedelia in a way similar to fellow New Yorkers Vanilla Fudge. The band continued on for the next couple of years with plans to record a second album, but those plans were nixed when the band's shared house in Staten Island burned to the ground in 1971, taking with it virtually all their recording equipment and instruments. Without any insurance, the band members called it quits.

The band was formed in 1979 under the name Tyrant, with Dave Chandler (guitar, vocals), Mark Adams (bass), and Armando Acosta (drums), but soon added Scott Reagers on vocals and changed their name to Saint Vitus after the song ""St. Vitus' Dance"" by Black Sabbath. Their main influences were Sabbath and Black Flag, the latter of which Saint Vitus toured with during the 1980's.

Under this line-up, Saint Vitus recorded 2 albums, ""Saint Vitus"" & ""Hallow's Victim"", and an EP ""The Walking Dead"". After ""The Walking Dead"" Reagers left the band and was replaced by The Obsessed frontman Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich (at this time, The Obsessed had only released one 7"").

Wino recorded three studio albums (""Born Too Late"", ""Mournful Cries"" & ""V""), a live album (""Live""), and an EP (""Thirsty and Miserable"", featuring the Black Flag cover of the same name) with Vitus. Weinrich left Saint Vitus in 1991 to reform The Obsessed after Vitus's label, Hellhound Records, released an album of older Obsessed recordings.

Following Weinrich's departure, Saint Vitus went on hiatus. The band finally found former Count Raven singer Christian Lindersson as Weinrich's replacement. He would record only one album, ""C.O.D."" before being replaced by original Vitus vocalist, Scott Reagers. 

Reagers recorded vocals for the band's final album, ""Die Healing"". After this, Saint Vitus decided to call it a day in 1996.

""Born Too Late"" line-up (Weinrich, Chandler, Adams, Acosta) played a gig at Double Door in Chicago.The performance was recorded and released on a DVD that is distributed through Chandler's current band, Debris, Inc., which features former Trouble bassist Ron Holzner. Following the reunion, Saint Vitus parted ways again.

As of 2008, Saint Vitus have reformed again. The band headlined the April 24 date at the 2009 Roadburn Festival.  The lineup for this reunion was the same as the 2003 reunion. Sometime after this gig, drummer Armando Acosta was removed from the band and was replaced by Henry Vasquez, with health concerns being cited as the primary case for his removal (Acosta eventually passed away in November 2010).

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

Wall of Voodoo had its roots in Acme Soundtracks, a film score business started by Stan Ridgway, who was later the vocalist and harmonica player for Wall of Voodoo. Acme Soundtracks' office was across the street from the Hollywood punk club The Masque and Ridgway was soon drawn into the emerging punk/new wave scene there. Marc Moreland, guitarist for local group The Skulls, began jamming with Ridgway at the Acme Soundtracks office and the soundtrack company soon morphed into a new wave band. In 1977, with the addition of Skulls members Bruce Moreland (Marc Moreland's brother) as bassist and Chas T. Gray as keyboardist, along with Joe Nanini (who had been the drummer for Black Randy and the Metrosquad) the first lineup of Wall of Voodoo was born.

The band was named Wall of Voodoo before their first gig in reference to a comment made by Ridgway's friend, bassist Joe Ramirez. Ramirez was listening to some of the Acme Soundtracks music Ridgway and Moreland had created in their studio. When Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine-and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector's legendary ""wall of sound"" production style, Ramirez commented it sounded more like a ""wall of voodoo"", and the name stuck."

The band played a succession of gigs around Glasgow to little effect, eventually finding kindred spirits among the London-based New Psychedelia crowd who likened their demos to ""The Hollies on speed"".  In 1984, by which time the band had effectively split up, two Mixers tracks - [i]Love Hurts[/i] and [i]Never Find Time[/i] - made it onto Daniel Treacy's legendary Whaam! compilation [i]All For Art And Art For All[/i], later re-surfacing as a 7"" on Vinyl Japan in the 1990s."

After a self-financed single in 1979, the band released a second in 1980 on the Aardvark label, after which Mick Fidler (vocals, guitar, saxophone) was added. Two further singles followed in 1981, before Ashley left, with Gouldthorpe taking over on vocals and Simon Hinkler (formerly of TV Product) joining on keyboards and guitar. They received support from John Peel, for whom they recorded their first session for his BBC Radio 1 show in July 1981, recording a second early the following year. They signed to the Red Flame label in 1982, releasing a single and the Dale Griffin-produced mini-LP Oceans that year. Their track ""Into the Garden"" reached number nine in the 1982 Festive Fifty. They were often compared to Joy Division, although Gouldthorpe stated ""We never listened to Joy Division – they were never an influence"". Further lineup changes followed, with John White replacing Fidler, who was sacked for missing rehearsals, Christopher Hendrick replacing MacKenzie, and David Hinkler joining on keyboards. The band was reduced to a trio of Gouldthorpe, Wilson, and Hendrick by the time of the release of their second album, One Afternoon in a Hot Air Balloon (1983), with White leaving to form UV Pop and Simon Hinkler moving into production. Simon and David Hinkler and Garry Wilson all played in Pulp around 1983. In 1984 Hendrick left, with MacKenzie returning, and the band moved on to the Golden Dawn label, adding Murray Fenton to the lineup. A third album, The Second Coming, was released in 1984. Simon Hinkler briefly returned, with band manager Tony Perrin added on bass. A live album was released in 1985, by which time the band had split up, after Fenton had joined The Batfish Boys.

Gouldthorpe and Simon Hinkler collaborated on a further album, Flight Commander Solitude & the Snake in 1986, and Hinkler went on to join The Mission. They collaborated on a second album, A Room Full of This, in 1992, working together under the name The Flight Commander.

A compilation of demos, live tracks and interviews, Afterwards, was released in 1989 on the Pleasantly Surprised label.

Gouldthorpe moved away from music to run his own hair salon, stating in 2009 ""I lost it with music for a bit and went into dark corners"".

The band reformed in 2007 after being invited to perform at the Meltdown Festival by long-time fan Jarvis Cocker, and recorded a session for Marc Riley's BBC 6 Music show. The band stayed together, releasing the Standing Still EP in 2009. In 2010 they decided to split up again after David Hinkler decided to leave, but continued after recruiting James Bacon to replace him. A new album, Civilisation, was released in October 2011.

Fagin was the frontman of Merseybeat band The Strangers, often appearing on the same bill as The Beatles. He was musical director for Jim Davidson, including his 1983 Falklands tour. Has one of the most recognisable voices ever to be heard on record, television, and film. Best known for performing the theme songs from the first and second series of the comedy-drama ""Auf Wiedersehen, Pet"", he has enjoyed success in the UK, Europe, and the USA with hit singles such as ""Why Don't We Spend the Night"" and ""Younger Days"". He has recorded a wide range of music styles, from the light-hearted pop/rock style of ""That's Livin' Alright"", the witty lyrics of ""Savin' Face"" (from the Bob Geldof film ""Number One""), the gentle, sentimental ""As Time Goes By"" to the theatrical sounds of the contemporary opera ""Paris"". Fagin has also demonstrated acting talent, both on television and in the theatre, from appearances with Bob Hoskins in ""The Long Good Friday"", the cult comedy ""Blott on the Landscape"" with David Suchet, to the theatre with an adaptation of the children's classic ""Wind in the Willows"", and most recently the contemporary opera ""Paris"".

The band achieved success in the mid-1980s and are best remembered for their hit single, ""Your Love"". The band's lineup at that time was guitarist John Spinks, vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis, and drummer Alan Jackman.

They enjoyed most commercial success in the US. Their first album, Play Deep, reached No. 9 on the Billboard 200 in 1985 and was certified triple platinum in the United States. The single ""Your Love"" reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 7 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The band continued to record and tour through the 1980s and then into the early 1990s. While subsequent albums Bangin' (1987) and Voices of Babylon (1989) saw some chart successes, the group's popularity waned.

Drummer Alan Jackman left and, as a duo, they recorded Diamond Days in 1991. After the disappointing response to their 1992 album Rockeye, which represented a shift towards progressive rock and arena rock, the group disbanded. They resumed touring in 1998, and released two live albums via their website, along with a new studio album, Any Time Now in 2004, which was later re-released in 2006. In 2011, the band released their final album, Replay, with original drummer Alan Jackman re-joining the band. Spinks died in 2014 after which the group officially disbanded."

Boon[/url] (vocals, guitar) and [a=Mike Watt] (bass, vocals) following the break-up of their previous band, [a1643632].  Although technically considered a punk rock band, the group frequently added elements of funk and jazz into their songs and would also incorporate classic rock covers into their records and live sets, most notably covering [a=Steely Dan], [a=Van Halen], [a=Creedence Clearwater Revival], and [a=Blue Öyster Cult] (the latter two were huge influences on a young Boon and Watt).  The band was known for the brevity of their songs, freeing them from solos, choruses, breakdowns, and fade-outs.  Also, [a=D. Boon] was known for his very trebly guitar tone, believing in a ""democratic"" sound, in which all instruments would sound distinct and be equally represented. 

Boon and Watt had wanted to include Reactionaries drummer [a=George Hurley] when the Minutemen formed, but he had immediately joined another band ([a=Hey Taxi]) following the Reactionaries demise, so instead they recruited a local welder named Frank Tonche to play drums.  The Minutemen played their first show with [a=Black Flag] and the two bands would develop a close relationship.  Tonche quit after the group's second show, disliking the punk audiences that the band played for, and Hurley opted to join the band (a collection of recordings with Tonche, called ""Georgeless"", was released on 7"" vinyl in 1993).  While D. Boon would sing the majority of the songs, all 3 members contributed to the songwriting.  The band was extremely prolific, issuing 4 LPs and 6 EPs in 5 years, and also appearing on numerous compilations.  Their 1984 double LP, ""Double Nickels On The Dime"", is their most critically well-received release.  Most of their work was issued via Black Flag's [l=SST Records] and the band's own label, [l=New Alliance Records].

The Minutemen came to end on December 22, 1985, when D. Boon, at age 27, was killed in automobile accident in Arizona.  The following year, a collection of live recordings called ""Ballot Result"" was released by SST.  Following Boon's death, Watt sold New Alliance to SST Records.  In 1986, a Minutemen fan named [a=Ed Crawford] encouraged Watt and Hurley to form a new band with him.  The band, [a=fIREHOSE], existed until 1994.  Since then, Watt and Hurely have played with various bands and sessions and Watt has also released several solo albums.  In 2005, Watt and Hurley reunited again in an improve rock group called [a=Unknown Instructors].

A documentary on the band, called ""[r=3583104]"", was released in 2005 and featured interviews with Watt and Hurley, along with a number of friends and contemporaries, including [a=Chuck Dukowski], [a=Henry Rollins], [a=Ian MacKaye], [a=John Doe (2)], [a=Kira Roessler], and many others."

He is an American musician and songwriter, best known as one of the founding members, long time guitar player and primary songwriters for the 1970s progressive rock band [a=Kansas (2)], whose biggest hits were [m56469] and [m56479]. In 1980, the ever introspective, soul-searching believer Kerry Livgren became a born again Christian. In 1983, after inner turmoil and dissatisfaction within the band with the way Livgren's lyrics were going, he decided himself to leave Kansas after [m217535] to pursue a solo career.

In the mid-80's, he formed the Christian Contemporary Group [a2106419], and after their breakup continued to record solo albums. In 2009, he appeared on [m868218], [a1192110]'s 3rd album, together with former Kansas singer [a579827] and his brother [a740883]. He also appears as a backing vocalist on many Christian artists' albums.

On September 1, 2009, Livgren had a stroke. His family established the Kansas band website as the only authorized source for information on Livgren's recovery. He made his first post-stroke appearance with Kansas on January 28, 2011, when he conducted the Kansas State University Symphony Orchestra for 'Dust in the Wind' during a special concert celebrating the 150th anniversary of the state of Kansas. Livgren was greeted with a prolonged standing ovation.

Though Livgren is known for his music, he is quick to point out that it is only one of his many pursuits. On his website, he quotes his biography: ""I'm a family man, I have a role in my church, I'm running a record label, a studio, a production company, a farm, and I have more hobbies and interests than there are hours in the day."""

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.

The Apostles were an experimental post-punk band who developed within the confines of the 1980s Anarcho Punk scene in the UK, but did not necessarily adhere to the aesthetics of that movement. 

Although the core of the group remained stable, Andy Martin and Dave Fanning were joined by various members over their 10 year span. Variation was also key in music styles as they varied from pop to punk to industrial through to pure experimentation, with influences like The Velvet Underground, The Adverts, Alternative TV, Lemon Kittens, The Pop Group and Twelve Cubic Feet cited. 

Although highly critical of the seemingly inward looking anarchist movement of the times, the autonomous and libertarian approach of The Apostles seemed to portray classic anarchism, as opposed to the conformity of many of their contemporaries. This led to much respect from notable members of the original anarcho-punk movement such as Crass with whom the band co-operated during the squatting of the Zig-Zag Club and running of [l=The Autonomy Centre] and [l=Centro Iberico] venues, and Conflict who released a single and album by The Apostles on their Mortarhate label. 

Originally formed in 1980 by William Corbett, Julian Portinari, Dan MacIntyre and Pete Bynghall, the band came into its own when Andy Martin joined to contribute lead vocals and lyrics. Shortly afterwards he was joined by Dave Fanning, ex-Innocent Bystander bassist. During this period the band recorded numerous DIY demo cassettes. In 1983 The Apostles released their first 7"" single and were joined by 14 year old Scottish drummer Chris Low, ex-Political Asylum. It is from this time that The Apostles have been described as having started their 'proper recording career', releasing four classic singles, the best of which are shortly to see a long overdue re-release on CD, plus numerous full-length albums and further cassette releases.

The Apostles split up in 1989, immediately forming [a=Academy 23] who released a number of works. Andy Martin & Dave Fanning continued as [a=Unit (6)] although Dave Fanning left Unit in 2007, leaving Andy Martin and Colin Murrell as the only members of Apostles in UNIT."

153073.0,291995.0,5916662,US,Kiss,Rock And Roll Over,1976,33.25,10,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Glam']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

The band was initially called The Creeping Ritual.

In 1980, Snowden and Dunning quit the band, and were replaced by [a=Rob Ritter] and [a=Terry Graham] (the rhythm section of the [a=The Bags]). Powers accepted an invite to join [a=The Cramps], and his place on guitar was taken by [a=Ward Dotson]. The new band went on to record the group's classic first two albums, ""Fire Of Love"" & ""Miami"". Ritter left the band in 1982 just before ""Miami"" was released - which is the reason the band is seen as a trio on the LP cover. Dotson soon quit as well.

Ritter taught his basslines to former Bags band-mate [a=Patricia Morrison] before leaving so she joined in his place. Graham quit, and gave his place to [a=Dee Pop]. The next release, the ""Death Party"" EP, came from an improptu recording session that featured [a=Jim Duckworth], and a bassist friend of Pop. For their next album - the only release to feature Morrison on bass - ""Las Vegas Story"" out in 1984, [a=Kid Congo Powers] returned on guitar, and Terry Graham on drums. After some successful tours, Pierce started to travel around the world and the band came to a halt for a period, as he started to work on his solo album. 

In 1987, Pierce staged a comeback for The Gun Club with [a=Kid Congo Powers], Pierce's girfriend [a=Romi Mori] and [a=Nick Sanderson] joining him. The band put out the well-received album ""Mother Juno"" the same year. Three more albums followed, and in 1995 a new line-up was formed including [a=Jeffrey Lee Pierce], [a=Wayne Kramer], [a=Mike Martt], [a=Kid Congo Powers] and [a=Romi Mori]. 

On the 31st of March 1996 the band sadly came to an end due the death of [a=Jeffrey Lee Pierce]. They were notable as one of the first bands in the punk rock subculture to incorporate influences from blues, rockabilly, and country music. The Gun Club has been called a ""tribal psychobilly blues"" band, as well as initiators of the cowpunk and punk blues sound."

 Guitarist, singer and songwriter. Founding member of the rock group [a=Spirit (8)], formed in 1967.
Randy was born into a musical family in Los Angeles and spent his early years studying varied styles at the family's Los Angeles folk club, the Ash Grove. In 1966, at the age of 15, when his mother Bernice Pearl and new stepfather, [a=Ed Cassidy] , moved to New York City where Cassidy had a number of jazz gigs lined up. It was there, at Manny's Guitars, that Randy met [a=Jimi Hendrix]. He played in Hendrix's band The Blue Flame that summer.
The stage name ""Randy California"" was given to him by Hendrix to distinguish him from another Randy in the band, who Hendrix had dubbed ""Randy Texas"". When Hendrix was invited to come to England by former bassist of British Invasion band The Animals [a=Chas Chandler], Randy's parents did not allow him to go so that he could finish high school. By some accounts, Chandler wanted Hendrix as the only guitarist for the band and nixed California's going to England. Hendrix invited Randy anyway, so they could ""go find [a=Jeff Beck]"".
Together with Cassidy, songwriter/front-man [a=Jay Ferguson], bassist [a=Mark Andes], & keyboardist [a=John Locke], California founded the band Spirit. Their first, self-titled album was released in January 1968, a month before California's 17th birthday. It has been suggested that [a=Jimmy Page] borrowed California's guitar part from ""Taurus"" off the album [r=2436399] when he wrote ""Stairway to Heaven"". Led Zeppelin was on the same bill as Spirit on some American dates in 1968 and 1969, which has further fueled this controversy. In 1996, in the liner notes for the reissue of Spirit's first album, California stated ""People always ask me why 'Stairway to Heaven' sounds exactly like 'Taurus,' which was released two years earlier. I know Led Zeppelin also played 'Fresh Garbage' in their live set. They opened up for us on their first American tour"". Since ""Fresh Garbage"" is a song from the same album that includes the song ""Taurus"", this only adds to the controversy that Led Zeppelin was at least aware of the song.
He then wrote the band's biggest hit, 1968's ""I Got a Line on You"" for Spirit's second album, [r=1271736].
Spirit was invited to open for Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. However, band manager & producer [a=Lou Adler], opposed it because the band was busy promoting their latest album, [r=1167375].
When Ferguson and Andes left Spirit to form Jo Jo Gunne due to the slow sales of [r=1015930], & then his dear friend Hendrix died, a depressed California left Spirit. He recorded [r=1612326], featuring many Hendrix-like tracks also featuring former Experience bassist [a=Noel Redding], AKA [a=Clit McTorius].
In 1974 California legally acquired the band name Spirit.
Randy California drowned in the ocean while rescuing his 12-year-old son from a rip current near the home of Bernice Pearl at Molokai, Hawaii. He managed to push his son Quinn, who survived, towards the shore.

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.  

All the members contributed to the songwriting but lyrics were often provided by people outside of the group, including Sandy Pearlman, rock scribe [A=Richard Meltzer], poets [a=Patti Smith] (Lanier's longtime companion) and [a=Jim Carroll], and science fiction author [a=Michael Moorcock], amongst others.  Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"". The Bouchard brothers also contributed lead vocals.  

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.  Lanier returned in 1987 and the band continued to tour, although they recorded very little.  2001's ""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"" was the band's last studio recording until 2020's ""The Symbol Remains.""  Roeser and Bloom continue to tour with new members (Lanier retired from the band in 2006 and passed away in 2013) .

Initially formed as a trio called ""Genesis,"" then ""Mammoth,"" in 1972 (Eddie on guitar and lead vocals, Alex on drums, Mark Stone on bass), and renamed ""Van Halen"" by David Lee Roth (ex-Red Ball Jets), who joined the band in 1973 after Mammoth had rented a PA system from him. Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

Paul Simmons joined from another local band. Various singers came and went. Dave Fane eventually made the job his.

We were all friends with the same ideals, so we formed the band as a way of keeping off the streets. A bit of a laugh to start with, Neil wrote most of the words, and Neil and Dave Fane worked the riffs out.

Most of our words came from Maggie Thatcher's Britain. High unemployment, race riots, getting picked on by soul boys and greasers, and learning to FIGHT BACK against everyone and everything.

We sent a demo tape off to No Future records. It contained three tracks: ""Leslie Whittle"", ""Good Ole' England"", and ""Fight Back"". They chose the latter for ""A Country Fit for Heroes, Vol. 1"". Garry Bushell, one of the founders of oi, reviewed it for Sounds music paper and said that it sounded like it was recorded in a phone box. We actually done it at Rocksnake studios in Rushden.

We graduated from playing youth clubs and mates garages to pubs and clubs, building up a following in Norhamptonshire with skins and punx. Most gigs ended in chaos and violence.

The early gigs were very local, as we were too young to drive. A local band helped out, the Zippps - very good local lads, and they had a transit van which helped.

A second demo tape was made again at Rocksnake containing: ""4 Wall Life"", ""Too Many Chiefs"", and ""Boot Boys"". Alas, Cherry Red records, who had bought No Future out (and our contract), were not big on street punk, so no other Hostile Youth trax were released.

""Fight Back"" did make it onto a Finnish (Finland) only release: a compilation of the best of No Future.

Band members: Neil Bowers (guitar), Martin Morris (bass), Paul Simmons (drums), Dave Fane (vocals).

Songs: ""Fight Back"", ""Boot Boys"", ""Southall's Burning"", ""4 Wall Life"", ""Too Many Chiefs"", ""Leslie Whittle"", ""Love and Hate"", ""Bleeding and Brawling"".

Covers included: ""Borstal Breakout"" (Sham), ""Crashed Out"" (Exploited), ""These Boots Were Made for Stomping"" (a take on Nancy Sinatra's classic) - a short detailed account of a slice of life.

Billed as ""The Only Band That Matters."" Adding catchy sloganistic socio-political lyrics to their brand of garage rock 'n' roll, the band soon explored wider musical horizons than most of their contemporaries, incorporating reggae, dub, rockabilly, hip hop and funk influences into their music and a whole lot more.

The US saw the second album ""[m=14959]"" released before the first to coincide with the band's first transatlantic tour in early 1979, and (like in Japan and in Canada) the first LP ""[m=24371]"" was soon repackaged with an updated track list and the addition of a free 7"" ""Groovy Times"" / ""Gates Of The West,"" which wasn't released separately. A year later, they were receiving worldwide acclaim with their classic double album ""[m=19382].""

Their classic lineup (circa 1977–1982) comprised [a=Joe Strummer] (vocals / guitar; born [url=/artist/782160]John Graham Mellor[/url], August 21, 1952, Ankara, Turkey; died December 22, 2002, Broomfield, Somerset, England), [a=Paul Simonon] (bass, vocals; born December 15, 1955, Thornton Heath, South London, England), [a=Mick Jones] (guitar, vocals; born June 26, 1955, Wandsworth, London, England) and [url=/artist/254552]Nicky ""Topper"" Headon[/url] (drums; born May 30, 1955, Bromley, Kent, England).

Starting in 1982, the band went through lineup changes due to infighting, and ultimately disbanded in January 1986. Soon after Strummer's death, on March 10, 2003, the band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (Performer)."

153073.0,41990.0,7083921,Greece,Kiss,Creatures Of The Night,1982,0.0,9,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Heavy Metal']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer). In 2016 [a=Jeremy Stacey] (drums, keyboards) joined as an eighth member making the group a ""double quartet"".

The band toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Levin and Jakszyk had earlier said that the North America tour was probably the band's last there."

Prolific in writing their own songs, Huw was the main songwriter, providing a range of stringed accompaniment - guitar, banjo, melodion and lead vocals. He was also known to sport a variety of headgear for the numerous gigs - though not onstage. Tony's main instrument was the double bass, although he also provided backing vocals, drums and guitar on some of their studio recordings.
They became widely known when their songs were covered by many other artists in Europe and the USA and their close association with the likes of Ralph McTell and Fairport Convention, both of whom championed their music. They developed a very large fan base and toured theatres and festivals throughout the 1990s before performing one final tour in 2001.

Founded 1972.

The Flying Saucers performed in the back of a truck during the 1976 famous Teddy Boy March in London (thousends of Rock 'n' Roll fans marched to the BBC where a 50.000 strong petition to play more Rock 'n' Roll music in the radio  were handed in). 

The Flying Saucers were formed in 1972 by bassist Pete Pritchard, drummer Terry Earl, guitarist Chris Townsend, and Rhythm guitarist/ vocalist Alan Jones. Jones and Townsend left the group in 1975 and were replaced by guitarist Nigel ""Niggsy"" Owen and vocalist Sandy Ford, who remained with the group. Jacko Buddin on saxophone was also added to the line up around this time. With help from a renewed interest in Rockabilly music and The British subculture movement known as Teddy Boy, The Flying Saucers toured Europe and earned recording contracts with EMI Music.

The Flying Saucers are best known for performing in the back of a truck during the 1976 Teddy Boy March in London. This march was part of a successful plan to promote the airplay of rockabilly music on BBC national Radio One. Within a matter of weeks, BBC disc jockeys Stuart Colman and Geoff Barker presented ""It's Rock ‘n’ Roll,"" an hourly show which featured the music of bands making music in the style of 1950s rock music, and a long list of guest performers including The Flying Saucers, Dave Edmunds and Crazy Cavan & The Rhythm Rockers amongst many others. The 1976 Teddy Boy March is often credited as the spark which ignited the Rockabilly revival and explosion in popularity of younger rockabilly acts such as Stray Cats and The Blasters during the early 1980s. Due to polished production and strategic artist promotion from EMI, the band's major label releases are often associated with the new wave scene, which embraced an entirely new generation of rockabilly-inspired groups. In 1980, The Flying Saucers appeared in the film Blue Suede Shoes, which was a documentary on rock and roll directed by Curtis Clark. The film starred notable pioneering rock artists such as Bill Haley & His Comets.

After numerous personnel changes, The Flying Saucers disbanded during the mid 1980s.

Pete Pritchard went on to become a session player and touring bassist, backing guitarist Alvin Lee of Ten Years After and playing bass for Scotty Moore, DJ Fontana and the Jordanaires on several tours. Pritchard was a co-founder of the independent blues record label Alligator Records, which has showcased seasoned artists and offered several new acts their first chance to record. In 2011, Pritchard was inducted into the International Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

The original singer was Alan Jones from the days they were called North nine and they changed their name to The Flying Saucers As the only original member of the group, Ford continues to tour and record with a reconstituted version of The Flying Saucers, billed as ""Sandy Ford's Flying Saucers.""

In 1991, Sandy Ford's Flying Saucers appeared in British film Buddy's Song, starring Roger Daltrey, Chesney Hawkes, Sharon Duce and Michael Elphick. The film was a sequel to the 1986 BBC television series Buddy, which starred Daltrey in the same role (it featured Wayne Goddard as Buddy, however). Daltrey, Bill Curbishley and Roy Baird acted as producers for the film and Daltrey also served as musical director. The film was accompanied by a soundtrack album which featured Hawkes' hit ""The One and Only"". It was filmed in London and various towns in the Thames Valley. Starring as a teddy boy Rockabilly group, Sandy Ford's Flying Saucers play the roles of themselves in the film. Playing the part of Terry's friends, they offer support by rehearsing with Buddy and becoming his backing band. Buddy contributes vocals and rhythm guitar while Sandy Ford handles lead guitar duties."

By 1976, the group was known simply as Utopia and was a stable quartet of Todd Rundgren, Kasim Sulton, Roger Powell and John ""Willie"" Wilcox. This version of the group gradually abandoned prog-rock for straightforward rock and pop.

In 1980, they had a top 40 hit with ""Set Me Free"". Though often thought of as a Rundgren-oriented project, all four members of Utopia wrote, sang, produced and performed on their albums; ""Set Me Free"", for example, was sung by Sulton. The group broke up in 1986, but reunited briefly in 1992. More recently, beginning in 2011 the earlier prog-rock incarnation known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia was revived for a series of live shows.

Their vinyl releases are still highly prized and priced ebay booty today. Nervous Germans played a string of legendary gigs in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Switzerland, France and England.
At the invitation of BBC legend John Peel Nervous Germans were invited into BBC’s Maida Vale Studio to record 4 tracks with producer Bob Sargeant and engineer Nick Gomm for a John Peel Session which was broadcast on 14th October 1980. A rare honour and as was heard at the time ...“not bad for a bunch of krauts“.
Nervous Germans are first and foremost Australian singer Grant Stevens and German bassist and composer Micki Meuser. The band toured in varying line ups from 1979 until 1984 when it all came to an abrupt end following a festival performance that included Mitch Ryder and Aswad. Stevens and Meuser both now live in Berlin and have breathed life back into the old beast. They have found worthy partners in Gary Schmalzl on guitar and drummer Sabine Ahlbrecht who bring the right ingredients to make Nervous Germans an act to reckon with.
The 5 year history of Nervous Germans song material provides around half of the current repertoire, new songs make up the rest. One obvious conclusion on hearing the old mixed with the new is that Nervous Germans was a band ahead of its time and listening today, sounds very “now“.
In summer 1984 Meuser & Stevens finally pulled the plug and Nervous Germans were no more.......until today....the phoenix arises.

Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist [a=Peter Gabriel], who left the band August 15, 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer [a=Phil Collins] who assumed lead vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist [a=Steve Hackett], two years later, saw the remaining three members (Phil Collins, keyboardist [a=Tony Banks] and bassist/guitarist [a=Mike Rutherford]) move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1996 Phil Collins left to concentrate on his solo work and other projects, leaving erstwhile bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks to forge ahead with new recruit; [a=Stiltskin] vocalist [a=Ray Wilson]. This line-up lasted for one album only (1997's [i]Calling All Stations[/i]) and Genesis soon found itself on hiatus after the poor performance and critical reaction of the new album.

In 2006 – after years of speculation – Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford reformed Genesis for the successful [i]Turn It On Again[/i] tour. A reunion involving ex-members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett remains much talked-about and unrealised.

Inducted into the [b]Rock & Roll Hall of Fame[/b] in 2010 (performer).

All four original members of Caravan (David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Pye Hastings, and Richard Coughlan) were, at one time or another, in that band. ""Caravan"" was however a big change in terms of musical direction, blending psychedelic rock, jazz, and classical influences to create a distinctive sound. They are considered a key part of the Canterbury scene of progressive rock acts, although they have never achieved the great commercial success that was widely predicted for them at the beginning of their career.

The band were originally based in Whitstable, Kent, near Canterbury, but moved to London when briefly signed to Verve Records. After being dropped by Verve, the band signed to Decca Records, where they released their most critically acclaimed album, ""In the Land of Grey and Pink"", in 1971. Dave Sinclair left after the album's release and was replaced on keyboards, but the group split up the following year. Hastings and Coughlan however, recruited new members, notably viola player Geoffrey Richardson, and continued touring and recording albums regularly despite more line-up changes that even saw original members David Sinclair and Richard Sinclair coming back and leaving again. They split in 1982 after a series of albums in pop vein, which left listeners wondering if this was still the same band who had released the landmark early-1970's albums... 

The band was inactive for most of the 1980s, apart from three sporadic live appearances in 1983 and 1984. But in 1990 Caravan was asked to play a one-off reunion concert under its original form (plus Jimmy Hastings), for a TV show screened by Central TV (“Bedrock” special). This was the start of the resumed activity of the band, who continued touring and recording in the 1990s, with again, the core trio of Hastings, Coughlan and Richardson, and other more or less regular members. 

The band stopped and reformed several times in the following decades, and Caravan still remain active as a live band in the 21st century, despite Coughlan's death in December 2013. "

They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

In 1980, Snowden and Dunning quit the band, and were replaced by [a=Rob Ritter] and [a=Terry Graham] (the rhythm section of the [a=The Bags]). Powers accepted an invite to join [a=The Cramps], and his place on guitar was taken by [a=Ward Dotson].

Ritter left the band in 1982 just before ""Miami"" was released - which is the reason the band is seen as a trio on the LP cover. Dotson soon quit as well.

Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.

He collaborated with [a=David Byrne], formerly of [a=Talking Heads], on ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Brian-Eno-David-Byrne-My-Life-In-The-Bush-Of-Ghosts/master/6392]My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts[/url]"" (1981) which was one of the first albums not in the rap or hip-hop genres to extensively feature sampling. 
Eno collaborated with [a=David Bowie] as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential ""Berlin Trilogy"" of albums, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Low/master/22382]Low[/url]"" (1977), ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Heroes/master/22294]Heroes[/url]"" (1977), and ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Lodger/master/22318]Lodger[/url]"" (1979), on Bowie's later album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-1-Outside-The-Nathan-Adler-Diaries-A-Hyper-Cycle/master/22350]1. Outside - The Nathan Adler Diaries: A Hyper Cycle[/url]"" (1995), and on the track ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Im-Afraid-Of-Americans/master/53966]I'm Afraid Of Americans[/url]"" (1997). 
He  has also collaborated with [a=Robert Fripp] of [a=King Crimson], [a=Robert Wyatt] on his ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Robert-Wyatt-Shleep/master/23627]Shleep[/url]"" (1997) album, with [a=Jon Hassell] and with the German duo [a=Cluster]. 

Eno is also well known for acting as a producer for a number of bands, these include [a=U2], [a=James], [a=Coldplay], et al. He won the Best Producer award at the 1994 and 1996 BRIT awards. He is an innovator across many fields of music and collaborated on the development of the Koan algorithmic music generator. He has also been involved in the field of visual arts. 

In 1996 Brian Eno, and others, started the Long Now Foundation to educate the public into thinking about the very long term future of society. Brian Eno is also a columnist for the British newspaper, The Observer.

[b]Joplin[/b] was the eldest of her siblings [a3565868] and [a3565870], and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where she began painting and listening to blues artists [a=Bessie Smith], [a=Leadbelly], [a=Big Mama Thornton] and [a=Odetta] with the other rebellious kids in her neighborhood. She graduated high school in 1960, and in 1962, she quit university in the middle of her studies. The university then ran the headline, ""She Dares To Be Different"" in the student newspaper.

She went to San Francisco in 1963, first living in North Beach and later, Haight-Ashbury, where she begun the drug and alcohol habits that would tragically end her life. During this period, she recorded a session with [a=Jorma Kaukonen] that later appeared as the bootleg ""The Typewriter Tape"". Noticeably suffering from her addictions, she returned to Port Arthur in May 1965 and 'straightened up' for a year, enrolling as a sociology major at Lamar University.

In 1966, at the invitation of [a=Chet Helms] whom she'd known as a teenager, she returned to California and was recruited as the singer for [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] in June, appearing at the [l=Avalon Ballroom] in San Francisco during her first public performance with them. In August 1966, the group signed with [l=Mainstream Records] and recorded an album. However, it was not released until a year later and in the meantime, with very little reward, they moved with the [a=Grateful Dead] to a house in Lagunitas, California. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drug use.

Joplin and the band signed with [a=Albert Grossman] in November 1967 and released [r559560] in 1968. This release was the culmination of a year in which Joplin had wowed audiences at the Monterey Pop Festival, the Anderson Theater in New York, the Wake For Martin Luther King Jr concert with [a=Jimi Hendrix] in New York and on TV's prime-time Dick Cavett Show. Joplin then left the band after a Family Dog benefit gig in December 1968 and formed a back-up group, the [a=Kozmic Blues Band], releasing an album in September 1969. The group disbanded three months later, with Joplin again suffering from her addictions.

After taking time out in Brazil with close friend Linda Gravenites (wife of Bay Area musician [a=Nick Gravenites] from 1962-1970), who was her costume designer and praised by Joplin in the May 1968 issue of Vogue, Joplin returned to America and formed the [a=Full Tilt Boogie Band], which began touring in May 1970. She also appeared in reunion concerts with [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] at this time. She then began recording a new album in September 1970 with producer [a=Paul A. Rothchild].

By Saturday, October 3rd Joplin had already laid down a number of takes at [l=Sunset Recording Studios] in LA, including ""Mercedes Benz"". On the following day she failed to appear and John Cooke, the road manager of Full Tilt Boogie Band, drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel where Joplin was staying. There he found her dead on the floor of her room, the result of a seizure caused by a heroin overdose.

Joplin was cremated and her ashes scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean. Her unfinished recordings were assembled and the result was the posthumously released [r755239] in 1971. It became the biggest selling album of her career.

Wall of Voodoo had its roots in Acme Soundtracks, a film score business started by Stan Ridgway, who was later the vocalist and harmonica player for Wall of Voodoo. Acme Soundtracks' office was across the street from the Hollywood punk club The Masque and Ridgway was soon drawn into the emerging punk/new wave scene there. Marc Moreland, guitarist for local group The Skulls, began jamming with Ridgway at the Acme Soundtracks office and the soundtrack company soon morphed into a new wave band. In 1977, with the addition of Skulls members Bruce Moreland (Marc Moreland's brother) as bassist and Chas T. Gray as keyboardist, along with Joe Nanini (who had been the drummer for Black Randy and the Metrosquad) the first lineup of Wall of Voodoo was born.

The band was named Wall of Voodoo before their first gig in reference to a comment made by Ridgway's friend, bassist Joe Ramirez. Ramirez was listening to some of the Acme Soundtracks music Ridgway and Moreland had created in their studio. When Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine-and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector's legendary ""wall of sound"" production style, Ramirez commented it sounded more like a ""wall of voodoo"", and the name stuck."

British experimental artist, avant-garde musician, poet and 'wild-child' of the 60s & 70s. Later an activist and Spanish resident, supportive of the propagation of the 'Canterbury Scene'.

Cramer, having studied at art school in the '50s, spent much of her teenage years in and around the Spanish hideout of Deià, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous in the bohemian lifestyle of the sixties. She became the catalyst to the meeting of Texan millionaire Wes Brunson and island inhabitants [a10354] and [a45646] who were visitors to [a515781]' home, which led to the eventual formation of [a152680].

Cramer, following an art career as 'June Onion' began exhibiting in the UK and her work gradually began to develop a multimedia form of presentation. Many of the retinue that became known as 'The Canterbury Scene' could be found lodging at her London residence in Maida Vale, or involved in her gigs in the early '70s. Now known as 'Lady June' she had a residency at London's 'Electric Cinema', performed at The Roundhouse in the International Festival Of Experimental Sound and appeared at The Paradiso in Amsterdam among the [a282968] & [a119009] gigs. Her avant-garde style was fused with works by a wide variety of artists such as [a4452], [a84684], [a239930] and [a51850]. Her experimental tapes were employed in a BBC Radiophone Workshop performance and she featured in other BBC appearances. It was at [a258438]'s birthday party in Lady June's flat in 1973 that [a5049] suffered his paralyzing fall from a window. 

As 'Lady Jane', Cramer continued her contributions to music and art and involvement with members of [a10346], working primarily from her Spanish home. Her work was part of a 'Fifty Years Of Deyan Art' broadcast on Spanish TV and arts festival in 1987. She died suddenly, in the midst of a long-term creation of work entitled 'Rebela' which, it is hoped, will emerge with the aid of musician [a249461].

Frida was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of ABBA, in 2010.
Born on November 15, 1945 in Ballangen, Norway. 
For more Frida releases, see [b][a=Anni-Frid Lyngstad][/b].

Based in Sweden, Frida started her music career in 1958 as a jazz singer, under her given name '[a688940]'. In 1964 she married jazz musician Ragnar Fredriksson and had two children, [a325133] and Ann Lise-Lotte Fredriksson. The couple separated in 1968. In 1967 she won [l=EMI]'s talent competition ""New Faces"", making her first TV appearance, singing ""[m=1721501]"", her first single, released on EMI's [l=His Master's Voice] imprint. Despite several singles on EMI, a few of them charting, and appearing on Swedish television and cabarets, Frida didn't become hugely popular in Sweden, prior to ABBA. She had her first #1 hit in 1971 with ""[m=1263138]"". The track was taken from Frida's first, eponymous album, produced by her then fiancé and future husband [a69873] (the two wouldn't marry until 1978). The album expanded Frida's style more towards pop.

In 1972, Frida signed with [l40813] and recorded her first single for the label, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/master/511035]Man Vill Ju Leva Lite Dessemellan[/url]"", which became her second #1 hit in Sweden. ABBA was formed that same year. The production of her first solo album for Polar took over a year, as the production of ABBA albums of ""Waterloo"" and ""ABBA"" took precedence. ""[m=129900]"" was released in November 1975 in Scandinavia. The single ""[r=2635546]"" (later recorded in English by ABBA), and the album reached to the Top 10 in Svensktoppen.

Frida didn't adopt the artist name 'Frida' completely before her post-ABBA releases, although only ""Frida"" appeared on the sleeve front of both of her 70s albums.

Frida divorced Andersson in 1981, and ABBA released their last new material in 1982 (until their comeback in 2021). This led Frida to collaborate with [a=Genesis] drummer and singer [a101028], on her album ""[m=82058]"", released in 1982. The single ""[m=129895]"" and the album became considerable hits, especially in Europe.

In 1984 the album ""[m=129893]"" was released, produced by [a50809]. Unlike her previous album, it was only a moderate success, mainly in continental Europe. Frida debuted as a songwriter on the album with ""Don't Do It"".

After the two solo albums, Frida concentrated on environmental issues and got involved with [a=Artister För Miljö], who released a single in 1992, with Frida on vocals. The same year she became a princess through her marriage to Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss (of Plauen) in 1992.

In 1996, the album ""[m=711064]"" was released. The album marked something of a comeback for Frida, although in Scandinavia only.

Frida has appeared as a guest singer, most notably with Swedish duo [a51226], [a=Deep Purple] keyboardist [a262410], [a2553309], and jazz trumpeter [a277489]."

Fronted by Anthony Meynell, Squire were at the forefront of the mod revival when The Jam bought attention to this burgeoning scene in the late 70's. With an impressive canon of timeless pop songs, as danceable as they are melodic, Squire sounded like no other band at the time. Releasing the first single of the genre – ‘Get Ready To Go!’, and kicking off the legendary Mods Mayday concert and live album, they continued with two fantastic singles for Arista, ‘Walking Down The Kings Road’ and ‘Face of Youth Today’, the fourth ‘My Mind Goes Round In Circles’ featured Kirsty MacColl on vocals.

""...If you can imagine the first Beatles album slammed through the sound of classic Flamin' Groovies, with all the wide-eyed enthusiasm and tunefulness that it implies, you'll be close to capturing the sheer joy of Squire"" - Dave Thompson - All Music Guide.

Squire recorded five albums and ten singles, including the 1983 sunshine pop album Get Smart, the 1984 groundbreaking ‘September Gurls’ album, the title track a cover of Big Star then undiscovered classic. Relocating to California in 1985 their sound became a perfect marriage of British mod beat and California paisley pop.

Following a solo career, new band Sugarplum, and Doctor of Music degree reflecting a lifelong dedication to popular music, Meynell reformed Squire to celebrate the millennium, following which has been an essentially live act playing all over the world. Two recent tours alongside original mods Secret Affair, albums ‘Get Ready To Go’, an extended version of ‘September Gurls’, a set of single releases, and a tribute album in their honour, they follow this year with a release of the never before heard mono mix of the September Gurls album.

Together with his brother, [a=Epic Soundtracks], [a=Nikki Sudden] formed what was to become [a=Swell Maps], releasing 4 singles and 2 albums on Rough Trade (UK) between 1977 and their break up in 1980. All these releases hit #1 in the UK Independent Charts. Swell Maps are remembered, particularly by similarly minded US based bands such as Sonic Youth, as pioneering exponents of the 'DIY Punk' school.
Sudden then began a solo career making two albums 'Waiting On Egypt' and 'The Bible Belt' before joining up with Birmingham guitarist, Dave Kusworth. The pair formed the Jacobites in 1983, going on to make two albums, 'Jacobites' and 'Robespierre’s Velvet Basement', the latter reaching No. 1 in the German Independent Charts. This tied in with their first German tour which lead to Sudden relocating there. 
When the Jacobites split in 1986, Sudden returned to his solo career with Creation Records, releasing five solo albums over the next five years: 'Texas', 'Dead Men Tell No Tales', 'Kiss You Kidnapped Charabanc' (with Rowland S. Howard), 'Groove' and a compilation, 'Back To The Coast'.
1990 found Sudden in Athens, Georgia, where sessions with [a=Peter Buck], [a=Mike Mills] and [a=Bill Berry (2)] from R.E.M. became the album 'The Jewel Thief' — later reissued as 'Liquor, Guns & Ammo'.
Kusworth and Sudden reformed The Jacobites in 1993, releasing three albums, 'Howling Good Times', 'Old Scarlett' and 'God Save Us Poor Sinners'. Their two original albums were reissued, as was a further compilation of rare tracks, 'Hawks Get Religion'. The band also released a limited edition, vinyl-only album, 'Kiss Of Life', in Germany, and a Spanish CD, 'Heart Of Hearts'.
In 1995, sessions in Chicago with members of the Chamber Strings and The Rosehips led to his seventh solo release 'Seven Lives Later'. This album featured musicians from The Jet Boys, The True Spirit, The Fatal Shore, Band Of Outsiders, Once Upon A Time, Vermooste Vløten, The Flaming Stars, Sonic Youth, Voodoo Witch, and The Jacobites.
Into the 2000's Sudden continued to tour extensively, playing around 100 shows per year, half with his backing band 'The Last Bandits' and half solo.
Nikki, with the Last Bandits, recorded his ninth solo release, 'Treasure Island', in England during summer 2002. Special guests include Ian McLagan (Small Faces, Faces), Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Anthony Thistlethwaite (Waterboys), Dave Kusworth (Jacobites) and Darrell Bath (Dogs D’Amour / Crybabys). The 'Treasure Island' release date was in 2004.
A retrospective, 'The Last Bandit (The Best Of Nikki Sudden)' was released by Glitterhouse Records in Europe, Wagging Dog Records in England, and Bomp Records in America, and features remastered and edited versions of  Sudden's most popular solo work.
Sudden's death in New York followed a number of solo performances in the USA after which a short European tour by The Jacobites had been scheduled. The first of these dates, on 29th March 2006 at London's '12 Bar Club', took place but was transformed into a tribute to Nikki Sudden's memory and featured a number of musicians with whom he had played.

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

The group was named after an early 20th century American slang phrase that appeared in the work of Aleister Crowley, William S. Burroughs, Robert Anton Wilson and filmmaker Julian Biggs. Formed in 1979 by Fritz Catlin, Johnny Turnbull and Sam Mills, and later augmented by Alex Turnbull and Tom Heslop, 23 Skidoo had interests in martial arts, Burundi and Kodo drumming, Fela Kuti, The Last Poets, William S. Burroughs, as well as the emerging confluence of industrial, post-punk and funk, heard in artists such as A Certain Ratio, Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, The Pop Group and This Heat.

Their first 7"", ""Ethics"" was released in 1980, followed by the ""Last Words"" 12"", produced by Stephen Mallinder from Cabaret Voltaire. A Peel Session was recorded on September 16, 1981 that included other associates Richard Heslop and Tim Soar. Their debut album, Seven Songs, was released in 1982 and is said to evoke the claustrophobic humidity of an African forest. An experimental EP Tearing Up The Plans was produced without the Turnbull brothers, who were traveling in Indonesia. Guitarist Sam Mills and vocalist Tom Heslop left the band soon after, and with the arrival of slap-bassist Peter ""Sketch"" Martin following the break-up of Linx, the lineup remained the same until their disintegration in 2003.

With the Turnbull brothers back from Indonesia where they were exposed to Gamelan, the band recruited Aswad's horn section for the ""Coup"" 12"", which featured samples from Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. It has been alleged that The Chemical Brothers stole the bass line for their ""Block Rockin' Beats"" track. The Culling Is Coming (1983 - noted for featuring the band live at the first WOMAD Festival) and Urban Gamelan (1984) followed, criticized at the time for their shift towards more abstract sounds. After having been evicted from their rehearsal space at Genesis P-Orridge's 'Death Factory' the band shifted their focus towards hip hop and released a few singles and a compilation album Just Like Everybody in 1987.

In 1989 the Turnbull brothers formed the Ronin label, and released material by Deckwrecka, Roots Manuva, and Rodney P amongst others. They signed to Virgin Records in 1991 and were able to build a new studio with their advance. In 2000 they released a self-titled LP, which featured contributions from Pharoah Sanders and Roots Manuva. This was followed by a compilation of singles, The Gospel Comes To New Guinea in 2002, and for the first time on CD, reissues of Seven Songs and Urban Gamelan. In 2003 the Turnbull brothers liquidated the company. In 2008 LTM reissued the whole back catalog of 23 Skidoo.

It was a group of amateur musicians with an interest in improvisation. They would meet on occasional weekends at a place called the Arun Leisure Center, where they would play in a rented room without the presence of an audience. 

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The line-up of the group was continually changing, and not all members could make it to every session. Occasionally there were guest musicians - including [a=Paul Kelday]! The 2 constant members were Phil Kelday, who distributed the tapes, and Heather Rolfe, who designed most of the covers.

153073.0,41737.0,4530023,US,Kiss,Alive!,1975,71.58,16,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Glam']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

After a self-financed single in 1979, the band released a second in 1980 on the Aardvark label, after which Mick Fidler (vocals, guitar, saxophone) was added. Two further singles followed in 1981, before Ashley left, with Gouldthorpe taking over on vocals and Simon Hinkler (formerly of TV Product) joining on keyboards and guitar. They received support from John Peel, for whom they recorded their first session for his BBC Radio 1 show in July 1981, recording a second early the following year. They signed to the Red Flame label in 1982, releasing a single and the Dale Griffin-produced mini-LP Oceans that year. Their track ""Into the Garden"" reached number nine in the 1982 Festive Fifty. They were often compared to Joy Division, although Gouldthorpe stated ""We never listened to Joy Division – they were never an influence"". Further lineup changes followed, with John White replacing Fidler, who was sacked for missing rehearsals, Christopher Hendrick replacing MacKenzie, and David Hinkler joining on keyboards. The band was reduced to a trio of Gouldthorpe, Wilson, and Hendrick by the time of the release of their second album, One Afternoon in a Hot Air Balloon (1983), with White leaving to form UV Pop and Simon Hinkler moving into production. Simon and David Hinkler and Garry Wilson all played in Pulp around 1983. In 1984 Hendrick left, with MacKenzie returning, and the band moved on to the Golden Dawn label, adding Murray Fenton to the lineup. A third album, The Second Coming, was released in 1984. Simon Hinkler briefly returned, with band manager Tony Perrin added on bass. A live album was released in 1985, by which time the band had split up, after Fenton had joined The Batfish Boys.

Gouldthorpe and Simon Hinkler collaborated on a further album, Flight Commander Solitude & the Snake in 1986, and Hinkler went on to join The Mission. They collaborated on a second album, A Room Full of This, in 1992, working together under the name The Flight Commander.

A compilation of demos, live tracks and interviews, Afterwards, was released in 1989 on the Pleasantly Surprised label.

Gouldthorpe moved away from music to run his own hair salon, stating in 2009 ""I lost it with music for a bit and went into dark corners"".

The band reformed in 2007 after being invited to perform at the Meltdown Festival by long-time fan Jarvis Cocker, and recorded a session for Marc Riley's BBC 6 Music show. The band stayed together, releasing the Standing Still EP in 2009. In 2010 they decided to split up again after David Hinkler decided to leave, but continued after recruiting James Bacon to replace him. A new album, Civilisation, was released in October 2011.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

	The core of the band were Graeme Garlick (guitar, vocals, song writing), Hilary Dron (bass, cover art) and Cyril Simsa (keyboards).  Graeme was originally from Manchester, Hilary was from Liverpool and Cyril was from North London.  David Jones, the drummer on the record, was brought in as a session musician after the original drummer quit, and never actually played live with the band, though he does a good job in the studio.

	In typical post-punk fashion, Graeme was the only real musician in the band.  Hilary was a trained artist, who worked as a PA in various cultural institutions and did design work; Cyril was an aspiring writer, who did odd jobs at the Natural History Museum and the British Library.  The band got together, when Cyril and Hilary both ended up working at the British Library at the same time. 

	Hilary had never played bass before, which is reflected in her unusually melodic approach to the instrument (sometimes even paralleling the vocals); and through Cyril had taken piano lessons in his teens, the instrument he was playing was an early monophonic keyboard synthesiser (a Roland), which would not play chords.  This is why the synthesiser also mostly plays melody lines (or counter-melodies) with a lot of attention to timbre and long, floating notes that fade away with a slowly decaying envelope.  For the purposes of the record, the band added an old electric piano as a second keyboard on selected tracks, but used it mostly to play sustained chords as harmonic fill in the background.  

	The album came about through a chance contact of Cyril's sister, who worked with Leo Feigin, well know at the time as a jazz producer and the founder of the rather austere avant-garde jazz label, Leo Records.  Leo was looking to expand his output into more popular genres and took a chance on SAV, but given the poor sales, it was his first and last venture into popular music.  

	It was Leo's idea to bring in Seva, a Russian expat he knew from his jazz label, to play sax on three tracks.  ""Kim Lambert"", the producer, was a moonlighting BBC sound engineer, which is why he worked only under his Christian names.  The LP also includes a slightly eccentric early use of samples: the party noises on ""Conscience"" (Side 2, Track 4) are actually field recordings of a hippopotamus from the Mzima Springs nature reserve, lifted from a sound effects disc and multitracked.  

	Unfortunately SAV did not long survive making an album and it fell apart by the end of 1982, which is in part why sales never took off, and though Graeme and Hilary continued in other musical ventures for a time, they never had much success.  Cyril went on to work as an editor and then moved to Prague, where he still lives.  Hilary returned to Liverpool and became an art teacher.  Graeme stayed in London.

Credited as Natasha, she released eleven solo singles on Towerbell, including ""Iko Iko"" in 1982. She appeared on Top of the Pops, and the song, produced by Tom Newman, rose to number 10 on the UK singles chart. It also charted in Ireland reaching number 7, Israel reaching number 6, and New Zealand where it peaked at number 5 as well as scoring the 26th biggest selling single of the year. Her follow-up record, ""The Boom Boom Room"", reached number 44 on the UK singles chart later in the year,and her album Captured reached number 53 on the UK albums chart. However, later singles on Towerbell, and a second, largely self-penned album Don’t Walk Away, had less success.

After her marriage to Bob England ended in the mid-1980s, she left the music business, and worked with horses and on animal rights issues.She moved to Canada and sang with the band Why before returning to England in the early 1990s. A few years later she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but eventually returned to the music industry. Relaunching her career in 2007 via Platform Records, her 1982 top 10 single Iko Iko was given its first digital release along with a 42 track anthology Back From The Mists of Time which included her entire 80's output. Album Deeper Into Reality followed in 2010, a collaboration with experimental producer Robert Logan. Further releases have included a 2013 cover of 'Get It On'(T.Rex) and 2015 single 'Work It Out'.

Natasha's version of ""Iko Iko"" enjoyed a resurgence when it was included on the soundtrack to the highest-grossing Italian film of 2014, Un Boss In Salotto (A Boss in the Living Room).

A new 13-track album and 2 -track single were released on August 10th 2018, entitled 'Somehow'."

Although she played the violin from childhood, she received her formal training in the visual arts.

By 1976, her performances were featured prominently in museums and concert venues across Europe and North America. Anderson’s performance are sample elements from such genres of cultural performance as storytelling, theatre, ritual, dance, music, popular enter- tainment, and sports.

In 1981, Anderson's single ""O Superman"" reached number two on the British pop charts. Until then music had been only one of the media employed in her work. Anderson has achieved greater visibility than most composers of her generation, her unexpected crossover into the popular domain brought her a degree of fame usually unavailable to avant-garde artists.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Spearheading Blitz's ultra-chic clientele were Steve Strange and DJ Rusty Egan, one time drummer with the Rich Kids. Seeking to record music of their own to fit in with the club's regular playlist (a steady diet of David Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Roxy Music), Strange and Egan were offered studio time by another Rich Kids alum, guitarist Midge Ure. In late 1978, this trio recorded a demo which yielded the first Visage single, an aptly futuristic cover of Zager & Evans' ""In the Year 2525.""

Adding Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie as well as three members of Magazine -- bassist Barry Adamson, guitarist John McGeoch, and keyboardist Dave Formula -- Visage signed to Martin Rushent's Genetic Records to release ""Tar,"" in September of 1979, followed a year later by their self-titled debut LP. The album yielded a major single in ""Fade To Grey,"" an instant club classic which heralded synth-pop's imminent commercial breakthrough. The follow-up, ""Mind of a Toy,"" was a Top 20 hit. Next came their sophomore album, 1982's ""The Anvil."" Midge, John, Dave and Billy left in 1983. ""Beat Boy,"" was Visage's 1984 release, the band now consisting of Steve Strange, Rusty Egan, Steve Barnacle and Gary Barnacle.

His interest in science led him to build his own effects boxes for the instrument. He became intrigued with all types of experimental music, from contemporary classical to free jazz and sophisticated rock. Sharp studied anthropology at Cornell University, where he played in a band and took an electronics class with synthesizer inventor [a=Robert Moog]. At Bard College he studied with free jazz pioneer [a=Roswell Rudd] (future Lounge Lizards John and [a=Evan Lurie] were classmates). He went to graduate school in Buffalo, where his academic advisor was [a=Morton Feldman]. He moved permanently to New York City in 1979, where he played gigs at various underground performance spaces, including the notorious ~Mudd Club. In the '80s Sharp became a major figure on the downtown New York experimental music scene, collaborating with many of its most prominent players, including [a=John Zorn], [a=Wayne Horvitz], [a=Bobby Previte], and [a=Butch Morris]. Over the years, Sharp has led his own bands more often than not. His music draws upon the wide range of his influences, from Coltrane to Zappa to Xenakis and beyond.

A remarkable blend of rock, psychedelia, world-music, ambient, reggae and dub, techno, and postmodern juxtapositions of TV and movie themes with pseudo-political and outer-space samples, Remipeds never quite let the listener know what was going on by making sure the band didn't either.

The Remipeds burned brightly for around two years. Their meteoric rise to fame, coupled with an incredible creative output in the form of songs, interpretive dances, children's stories, multi-media events, bodily noises, and more, took London and indeed most of England by storm. Their influence can be said to have penetrated every nook and cranny of popular music today. Yet despite this, most people have never heard of them. This is one of the profound injustices our research team at Pimlico University has set out to remedy. Along with what has come to be known in the literature as ""The Cover-Up,"" we will also trace how the band was boycotted by major record companies following the ""EMI Xmas Caper,"" in which the lads found that record company executives are singularly lacking in sense of humor when it pertains to their own persons. Living constantly at the temperature of their own destruction, and sometimes exceeding it by quite a bit, the at times overheated Remipeds came to epitomize the power of Creativity, Freedom, and Independent Music, proudly recording on their own Banana Records as a statement against the corruption so rampant in the music industry.

Unfortunately, the complex challenge of reconciling order and disorder within the band's profoundly pluralistic and admittedly ample bosom simply proved too much. After a couple of years, the centripetal force created by Remipeds expelled the band members one after the other. The band disbanded in the early 80s, but not before leaving behind an astonishing body of work. Slowly but surely, we hope to present this body of work on this web site. We want to bring to the attention of today's listeners a band that was so ahead of its time, it was once humorously speculated they were in fact time travellers. In a disturbing twist, and proving that many a true word is often spoken in jest, we shall see that this bizarre conjecture may not be as outlandish as it might seem. The fate of the members is documented, of course, in Harry J. Clarke's classic tale of the road, ""Me Wanta Rainbow Remiped: In Search of the Band that Changed the Music.""

This website will contain all the information available to us at present. It was compiled by the Ethno-Musicology department at Pimlico University by a team headed by Prof. Clifford Llewellyn. We will focus on presenting to the public a wide collection of artefacts, ranging from sound-samples to video-clips to historical segments, to published and unpublished interviews, found objects, reviews, merchandise, scholarly treatises and analyses, explorations of musical sources and influences and colleagues, drug paraphernalia, and other ""Remipediana."" Stay tuned, and feel free to drop us a line if you want to ask us anything, or if you have any information about the Remipeds. We are particularly interested in contacting people who saw, worked with, or were intimate with the band.

In 1974 both Larry Van Kriedt and Colin Burgess left and were replaced by Rob Bailey (bass) and Peter Clack (drums), a further change in 1974 saw Peter Clack leave and Tony Currenti (drums) join the band. In June 1974 they were signed by Harry Vanda & George Young (Malcolm & Angus's brother) to Albert Productions. In November 1974, Dave Evans left the band and was replaced by Bon Scott (vocals & bagpipes). Rob Bailey also left in 1974 and was replaced by George Young (bass). In 1975 Phil Rudd (drums) replaced Tony Currenti and Mark Evans (bass) replaced George Young. In June 1977 Mark Evans left and is replaced by Cliff Williams (bass) for their first tour of the USA. On the 19 Feb 1980 Bon Scott died at the age of 33. Brian Johnson (ex Geordie) joined the band to replace him on vocals and the album ""Back In Black"" was released, a tribute to Bon Scott, this album became the 2nd largest selling album of all time with over 40 million copies sold worldwide. In May 1983, Phil Rudd had a parting of the ways and was replaced by Simon Wright (drums), aged 20 then. November 1989 Simon Wright left and is replaced by Chris Slade (ex Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Uriah Heep & The Firm). In summer 1994 Phil Rudd ""quietly"" rejoined the band, but left again in 2015, which led to Slade's return. Malcolm Young left AC/DC in 2014 for health reasons. Brian Johnson was forced to stop touring in April 2016 because of hearing issues. To complete the 2016 tour dates, Axl Rose was recruited as a guest singer. In September 2016 Cliff Williams retired from the group. In 2020 it was announced that the band had reunited with Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams.

AC/DC are Australia's most successful rock band ever, and are popular around the world. The band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2003 as a performer.

His distinctive fretless bass sound and melodic playing style were a trademark of the band's sound. 

He emigrated to the UK from Cyprus in the early 1960s and met the three other founding members of Japan at Catford Boys' School in London.  Japan split in 1982, bowing out after a successful world tour and accompanying album, ""Oil On Canvas.""

Inside and outside Japan, Mick developed a distinctive and original bass sound instantly recognizable as his own. Mick was mainly a self-taught musician and many feel he forever changed the perception of how the bass is played and heard.  His rubbery, unique playing led best friend and Polytown band mate David Torn to say of Mick, ""It's as if Bootsy Collins was from Morocco.""  He also played woodwind instruments, mainly clarinet and saxophone, among many others.

Mick was a celebrated sculptor as well as an author and chef; he later qualified in psychiatry. He spoke several languages and in 2009 published his autobiography, ""Japan and Self Existence.""

After Japan, Mick worked in many areas of music, experimenting in jazz, ambient and prog, and continued to create his own indefinable music as a solo artist and in collaboration with other great musicians, including ex-members of Japan.

His first solo album, ""Titles,"" and the first Dalis Car collaboration, ""The Waking Hour,"" give those new to his music a good place to discover it."

After signing to [l=Verve Records] this was changed to 'The Mothers Of Invention' at the insistence of the label.

Guitarist [a=Elliot Ingber] then joined and, for much of their seminal 1960's albums, the group also included woodwind player [a=Bunk Gardner], saxophonist [a=Motorhead Sherwood], keyboardist [a=Don Preston], multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian Underwood] and additional drummers [a=Billy Mundi] and [a=Art Tripp].

Most of these artists appeared on ""Uncle Meat"", ""Hot Rats"", ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"" and ""Burnt Weeny Sandwich"". 

From 1970-72, Zappa formed a new line-up with former [a48408] members [a=Flo & Eddie] and bassist [a=Jim Pons].

Two more jazz rock albums, ""Waka Jawaka"" and ""The Grand Wazoo"", were recorded with much of the previous jazz-rock group including Preston, Ian and Ruth Underwood, Dunbar, Ponty, Guerin and Duke. Trumpeter [a=Sal Marquez] was also added. Zappa and the band went back to vocal rock songs with jazz elements in 1973 on ""Over-Nite Sensation"", then 1974's ""Apostrophe"" and 1975's ""One Size Fits All"". Much of the same band remained, along with new members [a2636463] (trombone), [a=Tom Fowler] (bass) and [a=Napoleon M. Brock] (saxophone). In 1975 Zappa called a halt to this backing band. By the late '70s an entirely new support band was formed, with only occasional participation from past members, including a re-appearance of [a=Captain Beefheart]. Beginning in the 80's, past 'Mothers' members Collins, Black, Gardner, Sherwood, Preston, Tom and Bruce Fowler occasionally played in a mock Zappa band, 'The Grandmothers'.

Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

Richard Kerr, a renowned British composer and songwriter, emerged as a significant figure in the music world through his collaboration with American lyricist Will Jennings. Together, they crafted some of the most memorable hits of the 1970s and 1980s. Kerr's journey in music began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period marked by his work with artists like Peter Green, Don Partridge, and Scott English. His partnership with English led to the creation of ""Brandy,"" which, when rebranded as ""Mandy"" and performed by Barry Manilow, soared to worldwide fame.
Kerr's impact on the music industry was not limited to his songwriting. He also explored his talents as a solo artist, releasing three albums between 1976 and 1982, which showcased his versatility and depth as a musician. His work encompassed a range of styles, appealing to a broad audience and earning him critical acclaim.
His contributions extended beyond his solo work, as he was instrumental in shaping the careers of other artists. The songs he wrote were performed by a variety of influential musicians, including Dionne Warwick and Helen Reddy. Kerr's ability to blend poetic lyricism with captivating melodies made his compositions timeless classics. His songs garnered multiple Grammy Award nominations and sold over 40 million records worldwide. "

Around 1980/81 Oxford based band Exit 13 changed their sound & changed their name to Aerial FX. They signed a publishing deal with Island Music, released 2 singles (""So Hard"" on Square Records & then ""Take It From Here"" on Island Records), & then bagged enough studio time to record ""Watching The Dance"" LP which was released on [l29864] along with a single ""Instant Feelings"".
 
They played shows around London & the UK throughout that period. Around 1982/83 the focus changed to studio recording & Melton & Bladon left the band. The other 3 continued writing & recording & EMI Records signed them mid 1983. Unfortunately there were creative disagreements with EMI & they didn't progress out of the studio, finally being dropped at the end of 1984.

Their studio experiments continued for another couple of years but nothing was released & they stopped making music as AFX around 1986. 

Nowadays Chris Hufford  is well-known in music industry as the manager of Radiohead, Supergrass and Gamma Hayes, he also produced some of Radiohead's early recordings, a group he would help steer to massive global success. Chris also run his new project [a178469] (Downtempo, IDM, ambient)

We did not take ourselves seriously, but we were serious about that. […] Like the Statue of Liberty we held up a shining torch of self-entertainment! Saying: Have fun! Play! Participate!

Entirely within the territorial limits of the United States. 4. Of all the Americas.[/i] In reality, this album was recorded, produced and released in the United Kingdom.

In 1982, the band released their second album, [r=1644730] LP. This time The 49 Americans recorded a collection of happy-go-lucky pop songs, co-written and produced by David Toop and Steve Beresford, and covering a wide range of 'faux light music' styles, from doo-wop to disco and samba. [l=Wire Magazine] included this album in their legendary [i]100 Records That Set the World On Fire[/i] list in Issue #175, published in Sep 1998.

For two decades, the short-lived 49 Americans remained mostly in the context of obscure DIY/art-punk bands, with all their 12"" and LPs being out-of-print.

The Passage were formed in March 1978 by Richard 'Dick' Witts together with Tony Friel and Lorraine Hilton. For Witts and Friel the band was extra-curricular, with Friel still playing bass in The Fall, and Witts juggling a post as music and dance officer for Merseyside Arts Association with a stint co-presenting What's On for Granada TV. Prior to this, Witts had trained as a classical percussionist and briefly played with the prestigious Hallé Orchestra; he was also a founder member of the Manchester Musicians' Collective.

Early Passage dates included a show at Eric's Club in Liverpool with Joy Division as support. '[r=810982]' was released on 7"" in December and featured two tracks apiece by Friel and Witts, with Love Song in particular raising eyebrows by virtue of an uncompromising lyric ('I love you/cos I need a cunt/I love you/to use you back and front') misconstrued by some as misogyny, although 'New Love Songs' sold a staggering 3,000.

Still a part-time group, the second Passage EP '[r=845728]' (OM 08) was produced by David Cunningham of Flying Lizards, and again featured two songs each by Tony Friel and Dick Witts. Recorded over two days, the standout track was an early version of 16 Hours, an intense meditation by Witts and Friel on infatuation. Indeed the EP was almost a concept record, with 16 Hours, Taking My Time, Clock Paradox and Time Delay all dealing with various aspects of the passage of time - a fixation repeated on the Contact EP involving Friel. However, About Time sold fewer copies than the first Passage EP, and following a London date with Cabaret Voltaire early in 1980 Friel left. For a brief period Lorraine Hilton's sister Martine joined on bass, although after Witts was injured in a car crash band activity was put on hold.

By the time The Passage recorded their debut album '[r=845692]' in July 1980, the group consisted of Dick Witts alone. Self-produced on eight-track equipment at Graveyard in just 70 tense hours, OBJ 011 made up in bile and bite what it lacked in production gloss. Standout tracks included a powerful version of 16 Hours, the brooding Watching You Dance and the memorable Troops Out, which despite an overt political agenda hinted that Witts was quite capable of writing a bona fide pop hit.

In due course The Passage expanded to become a trio, and recorded three further albums (For All & None, Degenerates and Enflame) as well as singles such as Taboos, XOYO and Wave. Today Witts is an academic, having published a history of the Arts Council in 1998, and lectures on modern music in London and Edinburgh.

He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias.

All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768].

Doug Sahm excelled in a wide range of genres throughout his career and influenced both the Texas and national music scenes. Sahm was a musical prodigy who, at an early age, began playing with a local band. He was singing on the radio at the age of five and was so gifted that he could play the fiddle, steel guitar, and mandolin by the time he was eight years old. Around this age, he appeared on the Louisiana Hayride, and before he was a teenager, Little Doug Sahm, as he was known, had played onstage with such greats as Hank Thompson, Faron Young, and Hank Williams. When he was thirteen he was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, but had to decline so he would not miss school. 

Sahm's career spanned over four decades and encompassed a variety of musical styles, including German polkas, blues, rock, and Tejano. In the 1950s he attended Sam Houston High School, San Antonio, where he formed several bands, including the Dell-Kings, Pharaohs, and Markays. In 1964 he helped found the Sir Douglas Quintet under the direction of producer Huey P. Meaux. This outlandish group of Texans, which included Sahm's friend Augie Meyers, dressed up and pretended to be part of the so-called ""British Invasion"" of the mid-1960s. Sahm wrote the quintet's 1965 smash hit, ""She's About a Mover,"" which made the Top 20 chart. 

In the 1970s he moved to Austin and became a member of the ""Cosmic Cowboy"" scene, along with Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker. He released his solo debut as [a509253] when he was signed by Atlantic Records in 1973. With help from his friends Flaco Jiménez, Bob Dylan, and Dr. John, Sahm released the album [m152060], which included the song ""Is Anybody Going to San Antone?"" 

In 1989 Sahm teamed up with Freddie Fender, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados. The group produced a soulful mix of country music, blues, ballad singing, Texas rock-and-roll, and conjunto. They were signed by Reprise Records in 1990 and released their first album, Texas Tornados, later that year.

Sahm was named Rolling Stone's 'Chicano Of The Year' in 1971."

The Pointer Sisters have won three Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. The group had 13 US top 20 hits between 1973 and 1985.

The group had its origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in 1969 as ""Pointers, a Pair"". The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita Pointer joined them. They got a record deal with Atlantic Records and released several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, recorded their debut album, and began seeing more success, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Country Vocal Performance for ""Fairytale"" (1974). Bonnie left the group in 1978 to commence a solo career with only modest success.

The group achieved its greatest commercial success as a trio during the 1980s consisting of the line-up of June, Ruth, and Anita, winning two more Grammys for the top 10 hits ""Jump (for My Love)"" (1984) and ""Automatic"" (1984). The group's other U.S. top 10 hits are ""Fire"" (1979), ""He's So Shy"" (1980), ""Slow Hand"" (1981), the remixed version of ""I'm So Excited"" (1984) and ""Neutron Dance"" (1985). June Pointer, the youngest sister, struggled with drug addiction for much of her career, leaving the group in April 2004 and dying from extensive cancer in April 2006, at the age of 52. She was replaced by Ruth's daughter Issa Pointer. This trio had a number two hit in Belgium in 2005, covering ""Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves"" with Belgian singer [a=Natalia (3)]. From 2009 until Anita Pointer's death in 2022, the group consisted of Anita, Ruth, Issa, and Ruth's granddaughter Sadako Pointer.

Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an ""adult"" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics; by and large, his songs were sensitive and sensual, which is part of the reason why he achieved such a large success. Once Twitty reached the top of the country charts in the late '60s, he stayed there for years on end, releasing a consistent stream of Top Ten hits that both defined and expanded the limitations of country-pop by adding subtle R&B, pop, and rock & roll influences. Though he had some pop success, Twitty remained country to the core; occasionally, his song titles were simply too corny, which was why he retained his popularity until his death in 1993, aged 59.

Some 25 years after the 'Hit' he achieved his second (and highest charting) hit with 'Bunsen Burner' (straight in at Number 9) which was achieved via a Social Media campaign and the incredible support of his fan base. In 2013 Otway premiered his biopic 'Otway - The Movie' at the Odeon, Leicester Square, which was received with critical acclaim by the media. Ever the one for clever ways to sell his records Otway has tried them all (with varying degrees of success and failure) from releasing singles without vocals to circulating discs with counterfeit WEA labels to using the sleeves as free entry to gigs. Add to this the huge deposit paid (and lost) to hire a jet to take his fans on a World Tour that never got off the ground and two autobiographies and you have a remarkable career of more than 40 years that defies belief!

She died in a bicycle accident on Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Spain, on 18 July 1988. According to her autobiography, her Catholic father Wilhelm Päffgen was an archeologist, stemming from a wealthy Bavarian brew master dynasty. But that can´t be correct: Gisela Päffgen proved that there wasn´t any relative named ""Wilhelm Päffgen"" - but an employee called ""Hermann Willhelm Päffgen"". Nico´s father died in WWII in 1942, and her mother Margarete (née Schulze, 1910-70) moved to Berlin-Schöneberg. Due to the heavy bombings, they soon moved again, to Lübbenau in Brandenburg, a small town in the eastern part of Germany.

After the war, mother and daughter moved to Berlin where Nico, aged 15 and already 175 cm (5'9"") tall, was discovered by photographer Herbert Tobias while she worked as a sales person at the KaDeWe department store. He supposedly gave her the nickname Nico after his lover, the Greek movie maker Nikos Papatakis. At first, she called herself both Christa Nico and Nico Otzak, but settled for Nico. The modelling career soon set off for the statuesque brunette-turned-blonde, which allowed her to work in Berlin, Paris, London and Rome. Already in the late 1950s she had an unprecedented modelling career for a German (with a contract with the Eileen Ford Agency), which enabled her to buy a house for her mother (already suffering from Parkinson's) on Ibiza in 1962. And it was in Rome where she had her first movie appearance as 'Nico' in [a463623]'s 'La dolce vita'. In 1959 she moved to Paris where she had an affair with [a=Alain Delon] and in 1962 gave birth to her only son, the troubled [a949333] whose father never acknowledged him.

In London she met [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Brian+Jones+(5)]Brian Jones[/url] and recorded her first single [r1171100], produced by Rolling Stones manager [a=Andrew Loog Oldham]. While modeling in New York, [a=Bob Dylan] introduced her to [a=Andy Warhol] and [a39766]. She sang three songs on the Velvet Underground's debut LP and played roles in several Warhol films. Following the release of her debut album, [m35096], her friend [a=Jim Morrison] encouraged her to write her own material.

She toured extensively in Europe, United States, Australia and Japan in the 1980s. After a concert in Berlin in June 1988, she went on holiday in Ibiza to rest. There she fell dead off a bicycle while taking a ride. At the time it happened, the story was that she was already dead from a stroke (brain hemmorhage) falling off the bike, whereas the narrative nowadays has been changed to ""an accident"" after which she died. Her ashes are buried at Friedhof Grunewald-Forst in Berlin at a place historically known as ""Cemetery of the Unknown"" or ""The Suicide Cemetery""."

Together with his brother, [a=Epic Soundtracks], [a=Nikki Sudden] formed what was to become [a=Swell Maps], releasing 4 singles and 2 albums on Rough Trade (UK) between 1977 and their break up in 1980. All these releases hit #1 in the UK Independent Charts. Swell Maps are remembered, particularly by similarly minded US based bands such as Sonic Youth, as pioneering exponents of the 'DIY Punk' school.
Sudden then began a solo career making two albums 'Waiting On Egypt' and 'The Bible Belt' before joining up with Birmingham guitarist, Dave Kusworth. The pair formed the Jacobites in 1983, going on to make two albums, 'Jacobites' and 'Robespierre’s Velvet Basement', the latter reaching No. 1 in the German Independent Charts. This tied in with their first German tour which lead to Sudden relocating there. 
When the Jacobites split in 1986, Sudden returned to his solo career with Creation Records, releasing five solo albums over the next five years: 'Texas', 'Dead Men Tell No Tales', 'Kiss You Kidnapped Charabanc' (with Rowland S. Howard), 'Groove' and a compilation, 'Back To The Coast'.
1990 found Sudden in Athens, Georgia, where sessions with [a=Peter Buck], [a=Mike Mills] and [a=Bill Berry (2)] from R.E.M. became the album 'The Jewel Thief' — later reissued as 'Liquor, Guns & Ammo'.
Kusworth and Sudden reformed The Jacobites in 1993, releasing three albums, 'Howling Good Times', 'Old Scarlett' and 'God Save Us Poor Sinners'. Their two original albums were reissued, as was a further compilation of rare tracks, 'Hawks Get Religion'. The band also released a limited edition, vinyl-only album, 'Kiss Of Life', in Germany, and a Spanish CD, 'Heart Of Hearts'.
In 1995, sessions in Chicago with members of the Chamber Strings and The Rosehips led to his seventh solo release 'Seven Lives Later'. This album featured musicians from The Jet Boys, The True Spirit, The Fatal Shore, Band Of Outsiders, Once Upon A Time, Vermooste Vløten, The Flaming Stars, Sonic Youth, Voodoo Witch, and The Jacobites.
Into the 2000's Sudden continued to tour extensively, playing around 100 shows per year, half with his backing band 'The Last Bandits' and half solo.
Nikki, with the Last Bandits, recorded his ninth solo release, 'Treasure Island', in England during summer 2002. Special guests include Ian McLagan (Small Faces, Faces), Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Anthony Thistlethwaite (Waterboys), Dave Kusworth (Jacobites) and Darrell Bath (Dogs D’Amour / Crybabys). The 'Treasure Island' release date was in 2004.
A retrospective, 'The Last Bandit (The Best Of Nikki Sudden)' was released by Glitterhouse Records in Europe, Wagging Dog Records in England, and Bomp Records in America, and features remastered and edited versions of  Sudden's most popular solo work.
Sudden's death in New York followed a number of solo performances in the USA after which a short European tour by The Jacobites had been scheduled. The first of these dates, on 29th March 2006 at London's '12 Bar Club', took place but was transformed into a tribute to Nikki Sudden's memory and featured a number of musicians with whom he had played.

They had a brief tenure under the moniker of 'Sandy & The Wheelchairs', and had a temporary drummer called Turtle, but once Danny came in on Drums and Nick from Lasky's came in on Bass, they felt the name 'Allegiance To No One' reflected their take on things far better. Influenced by Classic '77 style punk bands such as The Damned, their stated aim was to write tunes and put thought into the lyrics, covering subjects such as War, Media, Drugs, American Dominance, and lighter style songs about Dallas and The Royal Family.
These aims led to a set of songs with titles such as 'Palitoy Boy', 'War Theatre', 'Prince Charles Has Got VD', 'American Trash', 'Allegiance to No One' and 'Who the F*** are Genesis?'. Andy, Mike, Nick and Danny set out to play as many gigs as possible, and played some classic shows with The Kronstadt Uprising at 'Sid's' and the Zero 6, as well as headlining at local venues like The Focus Centre and The Cliff Hotel. A key local show was with Attila The Stockbroker + local poet Ian of Nazareth (aka Skinner Malive). They also managed to start playing further afield, and played with The Lost Cherrees in Brixton and The Subhumans in Stratford, amongst others. After a few years together however, by 1984 things were in need of a change, and to this end Danny and Nick departed, with Danny going on to play in Steve Hooker's Shakers. Around this time, Guy came in on Drums, and John Edwards of The Sinyx came in on Bass. This line up proved to be very solid, enabling the band to concentrate on writing newer songs.

Allegiance To No One - Andy, Guy, Mike & John - Live at The Pink Toothbrush 1985Not long after the line-up change, the band put out their own 11 track demo, including such titles as 'Nymphomaniac', 'Wages of War, 'She's Obese', 'But it's Impossible' and 'A.I.D.S.' Speaking to the local press at the time, Andy said ""As far as our musical direction is concerned, we are moving away from the ""thrash"" approach to more involved songs'.
The band continued playing and played a lot of local concerts, often with bands such as The Burning Idols and The Armless Teddies, as well as further afield, where they would often hire a coach to bring their followers along. As their sound progressed, they even got in backing singers 'The Fabulous Desparettes' to fill out the songs and help on more complex songs such as 'Tonight Won't You Be My Baby' and 'Do the Perado'. Andy told the Evening Echo at the time ""The new image will hopefully be useful because we will now be easily recognisable so people can buy us drinks and we can give more autographs."" After several years with the band however, Mike took the decision to step back and John's partner Mandy took over on Vocals. This ultimately led to a name change and the band called themselves The Cat Jugglers and they continued into the early '90's with this line up.
Like many bands of the era, they eventually petered by the early '90's, although they did manage to get a track on the Indigo Blue Records compilation 'The Best of The Rest'. They also had quite a prodigious output of songs, and they managed to record many of them on Andys 4-Track home studio and there are plans to release them one day.

That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs. It was also the label's idea to release the album under the name [b]Johnny Cougar[/b] which Mellencamp did not approve of.
It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks. 
Following that was [i]Uh-huh[/i] which would be his first release under the moniker [b]John Cougar Mellencamp[/b]; the name he would stick by until he gradually dropped the ""Cougar"" and just went by his given name [b]John Mellencamp[/b].

""Bat Out of Hell"" has sold more than 43 million copies worldwide.

Although he enjoyed success with ""Bat Out of Hell"" and ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell"" and earned a Grammy Award for 'Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance' for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native US. However, he retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for the number of weeks overall spent on the charts as of 2006. He ranked 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

He was one of the best-selling artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million copies. He has also appeared in over 50 movies and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His most notable roles included 'Eddie' in the American premiere of ""The Rocky Horror Show"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and Robert ""Bob"" Paulson in Fight Club.

The band was formed by vocalist [a=King Diamond (2)] and guitarist [a=Hank Shermann] in 1981.  The original MF line-up shared members with another Copenhagen band, Danger Zone, whom Diamond and Shermann were helping out.  By 1982, the ""classic"" Mercyful Fate line up of Diamond, Shermann, guitarist Michael Denner (ex-Brats and Danger Zone), bassist Timi ""Grabber"" Hansen (Danger Zone), and drummer Kim Ruzz was in place. Over the next couple years, the band would release an EP and 2 LPs that would cement their reputation as one the most influential metal bands of the early 1980s.  King Diamond's blasphemous lyrics and theatrical stage presence would have many label the band as part of the 1st wave of black metal, although musically the band was closer to the style of Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  The group split in 1985, as Shermann decided he wanted to pursue a more commercial direction.  King Diamond launched a solo career, taking Denner and Hansen with him, while Kim Ruzz disappeared into the regular world.

The band's legend continued to grow after their split.  In 1993, the classic line up, minus Kim Ruzz, reformed for a new album, ""In The Shadows"".  Hansen dropped out after that release but the group continued on throughout the 1990s.  At the same time, King Diamond kept his own solo career going.  Michael Denner left the band after 1996's ""Into The Unknown"" and Diamond and Sherman continued on with new players.  1999's ""9"" is, to date, the band's last full-length release.  King Diamond has stated that MF has not split up but the band is on hold for the foreseeable future.  In 2009, Diamond, Shermann, Denner, Hansen, and drummer Bjarne Holm (who has played with the group since 1994) reunited to re-record the songs ""Evil"" and ""Curse Of The Pharoah"" for the ""Guitar Hero:  Metallica"" video game.

In 2019, the group announced they would be playing a series of live dates.  The line up would include Diamond, Sherman, Wead, Holm, and bassist Joey Vera (filling in for Timi Hansen, who was battling cancer). Timi Hansen lost his battle with cancer on November 4th, 2019.

Inspired by [a=Throbbing Gristle], [a=File Under Pop] and the 'do-it-yourself' aesthetics of UK punk movement, the duo recorded and self-released [r=816612] on 7"" through the newly established [l=NB Records (4)] label. The edition of 1000 copies arrived from the pressing plant with white labels in plain sleeves, so Nag and Bendle hand-painted all the covers, and managed to distribute the entire stock.

The follow-up 7"" [r=816595] was released the same year, distributed by [l=Rough Trade]. Vinyl with photocopied cover and folded A4 inlay was packaged in a clear plastic sleeve, with 'tracklist' stickers on white labels. Inspired by anarcho-punks [a=Crass], T.D.A.T.W. wrote [i]Do not pay more than 55p[/i] on the cover, but the distributor nevertheless managed to sold out the edition of 2000 copies.

The Apostles were an experimental post-punk band who developed within the confines of the 1980s Anarcho Punk scene in the UK, but did not necessarily adhere to the aesthetics of that movement. 

Although the core of the group remained stable, Andy Martin and Dave Fanning were joined by various members over their 10 year span. Variation was also key in music styles as they varied from pop to punk to industrial through to pure experimentation, with influences like The Velvet Underground, The Adverts, Alternative TV, Lemon Kittens, The Pop Group and Twelve Cubic Feet cited. 

Although highly critical of the seemingly inward looking anarchist movement of the times, the autonomous and libertarian approach of The Apostles seemed to portray classic anarchism, as opposed to the conformity of many of their contemporaries. This led to much respect from notable members of the original anarcho-punk movement such as Crass with whom the band co-operated during the squatting of the Zig-Zag Club and running of [l=The Autonomy Centre] and [l=Centro Iberico] venues, and Conflict who released a single and album by The Apostles on their Mortarhate label. 

Originally formed in 1980 by William Corbett, Julian Portinari, Dan MacIntyre and Pete Bynghall, the band came into its own when Andy Martin joined to contribute lead vocals and lyrics. Shortly afterwards he was joined by Dave Fanning, ex-Innocent Bystander bassist. During this period the band recorded numerous DIY demo cassettes. In 1983 The Apostles released their first 7"" single and were joined by 14 year old Scottish drummer Chris Low, ex-Political Asylum. It is from this time that The Apostles have been described as having started their 'proper recording career', releasing four classic singles, the best of which are shortly to see a long overdue re-release on CD, plus numerous full-length albums and further cassette releases.

The Apostles split up in 1989, immediately forming [a=Academy 23] who released a number of works. Andy Martin & Dave Fanning continued as [a=Unit (6)] although Dave Fanning left Unit in 2007, leaving Andy Martin and Colin Murrell as the only members of Apostles in UNIT."
153073.0,42029.0,1549726,US,Kiss,Lick It Up,1983,0.0,10,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Heavy Metal']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

In 1974 both Larry Van Kriedt and Colin Burgess left and were replaced by Rob Bailey (bass) and Peter Clack (drums), a further change in 1974 saw Peter Clack leave and Tony Currenti (drums) join the band. In June 1974 they were signed by Harry Vanda & George Young (Malcolm & Angus's brother) to Albert Productions.

On the 19 Feb 1980 Bon Scott died at the age of 33. Brian Johnson (ex Geordie) joined the band to replace him on vocals and the album ""Back In Black"" was released, a tribute to Bon Scott, this album became the 2nd largest selling album of all time with over 40 million copies sold worldwide. In May 1983, Phil Rudd had a parting of the ways and was replaced by Simon Wright (drums), aged 20 then. November 1989 Simon Wright left and is replaced by Chris Slade (ex Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Uriah Heep & The Firm). In summer 1994 Phil Rudd ""quietly"" rejoined the band, but left again in 2015, which led to Slade's return. Malcolm Young left AC/DC in 2014 for health reasons. Brian Johnson was forced to stop touring in April 2016 because of hearing issues. To complete the 2016 tour dates, Axl Rose was recruited as a guest singer. In September 2016 Cliff Williams retired from the group. In 2020 it was announced that the band had reunited with Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams.

AC/DC are Australia's most successful rock band ever, and are popular around the world. The band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2003 as a performer.

Hillage evolved from prodigy to virtuoso and the guitar sound evolved with echoes and reverb blending with synthesizers. he was a pioneer in new age ambient music and retired from recording for a while as he went on to be a prominent producer in the early 1980's, most known for his work on the Simple Minds albums of that era. Some years later he was in a club and heard The Orb sampling his music and hooked up with them.

From the period of 1976 to 1985, the line-up of 999 consisted of Nick Cash (vocals, guitar - real name Keith Lucas, not to be confused with Nicholas John Cash), Guy Days (lead guitar), Jon Watson (bass guitar) and Pablo LaBrittain (drums). (As a result of injuries sustained in a motor accident, LaBrittain was temporarily replaced by drummer Ed Case aka Paul Edwards in 1980.) Jon Watson left the band in 1985; being replaced by Danny Palmer, who remained with the band until 1991. Palmer was replaced by Arturo Bassick, who remains the bass guitarist with 999 to this date.

Between 1978 and 2007, 999 released fourteen singles and twelve studio albums. Five of the singles released by 999 between 1978 and 1981 charted within the Top 75 in the UK Singles Chart, with one further single released by 999 in 1978, Homicide, charting within the Top 40. In addition, as a result of extensive touring in the United States in the early 1980s, the band's third and fourth studio albums: The Biggest Prize in Sport and Concrete, each charted on the U.S. Billboard 200.

Despite having formed in 1976, 999 have only experienced two permanent changes to their original line-up and has continued to record and play live to the present day, leading AllMusic to describe the band as ""one of the longest-lived groups of the punk era."""

Adi Newton formed the first lineup of Clock DVA in 1978, after his departure from The Future (the other members of which would go on to form The Human League and Heaven 17) with Judd Turner (bass), David J. Hammond (guitar), Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophone, clarinet).
The term 'DVA,' [meaning 'two' in Russian] was inspired by Anthony Burgess' satirical science fiction novel, 'A Clockwork Orange.').
Originally focusing on experimental music inspired by science fiction and the occult (with the latter fading as time went on) and later reflecting the burgeoning industrial and electronic body music that had begun seeping into underground music scenes on both sides of the Atlantic.
After a handful of privately produced cassettes (most of which have since been collected in the 'Horology' boxed sets of lps from the German label Vinyl-On-Demand) the band released a cassette on Throbbing Gristle's Industrial Records label.
""White Souls In Black Suits"" features founder members Adi Newton (vocals, violin, EMS Synthi E, tapes), Steven James ""Judd"" Turner (bass, vocals, treatments, rhythm machine, ex-Block Opposite), and the original guitarist David J. Hammond (guitar, treatments). Two additional musicians were added to the line up, Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophones, flute, and percussion,) and featured a sound much more in line with their contemporaries outside of the Sheffield scene (which had gravited to a smoother more pop oriented sound, for the most part.) The first formalised DVA line up also featured Simon Mark Elliot-Kemp on synthesiser.

In 1981, David J Hammond left and guitarist Paul Widger joined in 1980. The following album, ""Thirst,"" was produced by Psychic TV producer Ken Thomas and released through the independent record label Fetish (and was cited, by the NME Journalist Paul Morley, as one of the great albums of the 80's alongside Joy Division's ""Unknown Pleasures"" and The Fall's ""Dragnet"".)  After ""Thirst"", Newton & Turner decided to take Clock DVA into another direction and parted company with Qual, Collins and Widger, who consequently formed the short lived group The Box. Tragedy struck later with the death of co-founder Steven James Turner. By 1983, with Newton as the only remaining original member, replacements had been found in John Valentine Carruthers (guitar), Paul Browse (saxophone), Dean Dennis (bass) and Nick Sanderson (drums). A brace of singles then preceded ""Advantage"", their first album for Polydor Records. The following year Carruthers and Sanderson departed, leaving Clock DVA to continue as a trio. Although it would be five years before another Clock DVA album, Newton remained busy with his audio visual conceptual project [a=The Anti Group] (TAGC) which researched and developed ambisonics and psychoacoustics through experimental uses of frequencies and ambient acousmatic sound pieces, alongside visual and conceptual text pieces.
The album, ""The Delivery"" (a soundtrack album for a TAGC 16 mm film,) a series of recordings including ""Documents"" and the acclaimed ambisonic album ""Digitaria"" and the pioneering ""Meontological Research Recordings"" were released, as well as the soundtrack to ""Burning Water"", a 25 min TAGC film.
In 1988 ""Buried Dreams"" was recorded utilising the first digital sampling synthesisers and computer sequencing which Newton had been experimenting with in TAGC, released in 1989 by Interfisch, and often hailed as the group's masterpiece. By the time of 1991's ""Transitional Voices"", Browse had been replaced by Robert E. Baker, of TAGC. The departure of Dennis after the completion of ""Man Amplified"" and ""Digital Soundtracks"" in 1992 left the remaining duo of Newton and Baker to record ""Sign"", released on the Italian Record Label Contempo.

After 15 years of silence, Adi Newton reactivated Clock DVA.  Since 2011 the new line-up (feat. Maurizio ""TeZ"" Martinucci) has performed at major independent electronic festivals and venues throughout Europe. The 'Horology' series of vinyl box sets compiling early cassette-only material began in 2012 (with three volumes released as of 2019) and Mute Records have signed a contract with Newton to reissue all of the official Clock DVA recordings (minus private press cassette releases) along with a new studio album.
A ""new"" album, ""Post-Sign"" was released in 2013, having been recorded in 1994/95 by Newton as an instrumental companion album to ""Sign"", which had remained unreleased due to problems with an Italian record label after Contempo's demise.
""Clock 2"", a printed aluminium USB Smart Media Card in printed metal box was released with all new material plus remixes by ATOM, Scanner, Frank Bretschneider and also features several videos by [a3925208] and a 48-page PDF, was release in 2014, as well as a limited silkscreened double sleeve 45rpm 12"" of ""The Konstructor/De Konstructor"" with two DVA remixes, both through Newton's own label Anterior Research Media Communications _ armcomm.co.uk.

Outspoken regarding issues such as anarchism, animal rights, the anti-war movement and in their support for the organisation Class War, a number of their gigs during the 1980s were followed by riots and disturbances. The band's 'Mortarhate' logo, originally designed by 'Nihilistic Nobody' is claimed to be a reference to the initials CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) as well as incorporating two 'A's for anarchy and autonomy, and an 'N' for nihilism.

 UK band, formed in 1983 from the remnants of 'CIVIL DEFENCE'. Had a couple of air plays on the John Peel Show.
Paranoia's roots began in Stoke-on-Trent in 1979 when Paul bought his brother Phil a set of drums, Paul already having learnt to play guitar, the two of them set about covering punked up versions of Bowie and T-Rex classics! they soon found it time to expand and to bring in a vocalist and bass player through ads in the national music press in 1980, the only suitable reply was from a vocalist, Ged, from Market Drayton, who said he would bring his mate along, Steve who was actually a drummer but would have go on bass. Watched by Paul's sister Jan and husband Mick, the band which had no name at this point, rehearsed for there first and last time with this line up as the next time they were due to rehearse, Ged and Steve didn't bother to turn up. Jan felt a bit sorry for her brothers so said she would have a go at vocals and Mick started to learn bass guitar from Paul. They then advertised for a lead guitarist to fill out their sound and found Dave in '81, there first song ""1984"" was written at this time and they adopted a synthesizer played by Jan. Dave tried to influence the direction of the band too much and was eventually asked to leave the group, which still had no proper name or gigs.
Later in '81 they brought in another guitarist- Phil H and his girlfriend Gwyn took over on synth, and called themslved CIVIL DEFENSE and started to get a few gigs, some through CND and one through the Stoke musicans collective, they continued to gig locally until 1983 when Phil and Gwyn amicably left the band.
That left Jan- vocals, Paul- guitar, Mick- bass and Phil- drums, the name Civil Defense was changed to Paranoia, the synthesizer was dropped and they took on a more aggressive punk sound, although by no means ""hardcore"", and bringing in some new songs and gradually leaving out the older ones.
Finding gigs difficult to come by through the closure of local venues they decided the only way to get heard was to make a demo. In September '83 they hired a studio and recorded the first demo which included the tracks ""The Gig"", ""Rock Revolution"", ""Shattered Glass"", ""Robots"", ""Disillusion"", and ""Graveyard Of Hell"", copies of the demo were sent to various independent labels, most replied but they all more or less said ""great potential, but the punk market is dead"", Rot records being the only label to show any interest and offer them a place on a compilation album, the Paranoia songs used on this album were well received and led to a deal to release a lp and single which again received favourable reviews despite the somewhat limited distribution... by 1985 they had left Rot Records after turning down a prospective tour with labelmates the VARUKERS, just after this Paul the guitarist left and Russ Lovettt joined in his place and they proceeded to release the 1986 cassette abum ""Pain And Pleasure"" which was only available from the band at their gigs and through the mail.

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The line-up of the group was continually changing, and not all members could make it to every session. Occasionally there were guest musicians - including [a=Paul Kelday]! The 2 constant members were Phil Kelday, who distributed the tapes, and Heather Rolfe, who designed most of the covers.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Their live performances were surreal vaudeville shows in which songs became full fledged production numbers. 

The Tubes scored their first hit ""White Punks on Dope,"" on their self-titled debut album released on A&M records. Their second album, “Young And Rich,""  included their second hit single – the suggestive duet “Don't Touch Me There.""  The Tubes released three more albums on A&M before being dropped in 1982, slimming back down to the original lineup. Capitol Records signed them upon their release from A&M and they released their most successful album to date, the concept album “The Completion Backward Principle.""

“The Completion Backward Principle,""  contained the hits, “Don't Want To Wait Anymore,"" “Sushi Girl,” and the classic rock staple “Talk To You Later.""  

Their next release on Capitol was ""Outside Inside,"" which featured the top 10 US single “She's A Beauty.""  

In 1985 The Tubes released “Love Bomb,"" which was not a commercial success and years of expensive tours left the band a half million dollars in debt.  Capitol dropped the Tubes and lead singer Fee Waybill left the band, with David Killngsworth joining as his replacement.  

The years that followed saw several personnel changes in the band, with Spooner, Cotten and Welnick all departed by mid-1989, and Waybill ultimately returning to the band in the 1990's.  While the Tubes have continued to release music, the fame and notoriety of the late 70's and early 80's remain as the bands true legacy."

Fronted by Anthony Meynell, Squire were at the forefront of the mod revival when The Jam bought attention to this burgeoning scene in the late 70's. With an impressive canon of timeless pop songs, as danceable as they are melodic, Squire sounded like no other band at the time. Releasing the first single of the genre – ‘Get Ready To Go!’, and kicking off the legendary Mods Mayday concert and live album, they continued with two fantastic singles for Arista, ‘Walking Down The Kings Road’ and ‘Face of Youth Today’, the fourth ‘My Mind Goes Round In Circles’ featured Kirsty MacColl on vocals.

""...If you can imagine the first Beatles album slammed through the sound of classic Flamin' Groovies, with all the wide-eyed enthusiasm and tunefulness that it implies, you'll be close to capturing the sheer joy of Squire"" - Dave Thompson - All Music Guide.

Squire recorded five albums and ten singles, including the 1983 sunshine pop album Get Smart, the 1984 groundbreaking ‘September Gurls’ album, the title track a cover of Big Star then undiscovered classic. Relocating to California in 1985 their sound became a perfect marriage of British mod beat and California paisley pop.

Following a solo career, new band Sugarplum, and Doctor of Music degree reflecting a lifelong dedication to popular music, Meynell reformed Squire to celebrate the millennium, following which has been an essentially live act playing all over the world. Two recent tours alongside original mods Secret Affair, albums ‘Get Ready To Go’, an extended version of ‘September Gurls’, a set of single releases, and a tribute album in their honour, they follow this year with a release of the never before heard mono mix of the September Gurls album.

The Apostles were an experimental post-punk band who developed within the confines of the 1980s Anarcho Punk scene in the UK, but did not necessarily adhere to the aesthetics of that movement. 

Although the core of the group remained stable, Andy Martin and Dave Fanning were joined by various members over their 10 year span. Variation was also key in music styles as they varied from pop to punk to industrial through to pure experimentation, with influences like The Velvet Underground, The Adverts, Alternative TV, Lemon Kittens, The Pop Group and Twelve Cubic Feet cited. 

Although highly critical of the seemingly inward looking anarchist movement of the times, the autonomous and libertarian approach of The Apostles seemed to portray classic anarchism, as opposed to the conformity of many of their contemporaries. This led to much respect from notable members of the original anarcho-punk movement such as Crass with whom the band co-operated during the squatting of the Zig-Zag Club and running of [l=The Autonomy Centre] and [l=Centro Iberico] venues, and Conflict who released a single and album by The Apostles on their Mortarhate label. 

Originally formed in 1980 by William Corbett, Julian Portinari, Dan MacIntyre and Pete Bynghall, the band came into its own when Andy Martin joined to contribute lead vocals and lyrics. Shortly afterwards he was joined by Dave Fanning, ex-Innocent Bystander bassist. During this period the band recorded numerous DIY demo cassettes. In 1983 The Apostles released their first 7"" single and were joined by 14 year old Scottish drummer Chris Low, ex-Political Asylum. It is from this time that The Apostles have been described as having started their 'proper recording career', releasing four classic singles, the best of which are shortly to see a long overdue re-release on CD, plus numerous full-length albums and further cassette releases.

The Apostles split up in 1989, immediately forming [a=Academy 23] who released a number of works. Andy Martin & Dave Fanning continued as [a=Unit (6)] although Dave Fanning left Unit in 2007, leaving Andy Martin and Colin Murrell as the only members of Apostles in UNIT."

His best known composition is ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" for the movie ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Various-Arthur-The-Album/master/157691]Arthur[/url]"" starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli. 
The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1981 (shared award with Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen).

Cross played with an Austin group called Flash before signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records, thanks to which he released his debut album, ""Christopher Cross"" in 1979 for which he won 5 Grammy awards. He received in the same gala the 4 main prizes that are: best recording, best song, best album and best new artist. Of this album they emphasize the songs ""Sailing"", ""Ride Like the Wind"" and ""Never Be the Same"".

His second album, [i]Another Page[/i] released in 1983 included the songs, ""Think of Laura"" and ""All Right"".

The song ""Think Of Laura"" has nothing to do with the characters Luke and Laura from the soap opera [i]General Hospital[/i]. He allowed ABC to use the song in this context; however, he has stated that he wrote ""Think of Laura"" not in reference to the television characters, but to celebrate the life of Denison University college student Laura Carter who was killed when she was struck by a stray bullet.

Cross contributed voices in the 1985 David Lee Roth song called ""California Girls"" and also voiced Alan Parsons' song ""So Far Away"" and has once come up with him on stage to play it.

The song ""Loving Strangers (David's theme)"" is part of the soundtrack of the movie [url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Various-Nothing-In-Common-Original-Soundtrack/master/415115][i]Nothing In Common[/i][/url] from 1986, with Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason.

His daughter Madison Cross is a singer and actress.

The oldest son of Peter Griffin in the series [i]Family Guy[/i] is named Christopher Cross Griffin.

Since 1981, Christopher held the record of being the only artist to win the so-called ""Big Four"" of the Grammy Awards in a single ceremony: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist.

The group fit nicely into New York's punk and new wave scene, and an early single, ""American Beat,"" attracted the attention of independent label Red Star and, in time, I.R.S.

The band continued to record through the '80s and released Powerstance in 1992 and Beautiful Light in 1994. (Powerstance also marked the debut of new Fleshtones bassist Ken Fox, who replaced Pakulski in the lineup and has been with the group ever since.) While the group's popularity dipped under the radar in the last half of the '90s, in 2003 the group bounded back when they were signed to the potent indie label Yep Roc Records and released one of their best albums, Do You Swing?

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The line-up of the group was continually changing, and not all members could make it to every session. Occasionally there were guest musicians - including [a=Paul Kelday]! The 2 constant members were Phil Kelday, who distributed the tapes, and Heather Rolfe, who designed most of the covers.

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].

Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.

Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"". The Bouchard brothers also contributed lead vocals.  

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.  Lanier returned in 1987 and the band continued to tour, although they recorded very little.  2001's ""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"" was the band's last studio recording until 2020's ""The Symbol Remains.""  Roeser and Bloom continue to tour with new members (Lanier retired from the band in 2006 and passed away in 2013) .

She died in a bicycle accident on Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Spain, on 18 July 1988. According to her autobiography, her Catholic father Wilhelm Päffgen was an archeologist, stemming from a wealthy Bavarian brew master dynasty. But that can´t be correct: Gisela Päffgen proved that there wasn´t any relative named ""Wilhelm Päffgen"" - but an employee called ""Hermann Willhelm Päffgen"". Nico´s father died in WWII in 1942, and her mother Margarete (née Schulze, 1910-70) moved to Berlin-Schöneberg. Due to the heavy bombings, they soon moved again, to Lübbenau in Brandenburg, a small town in the eastern part of Germany.

After the war, mother and daughter moved to Berlin where Nico, aged 15 and already 175 cm (5'9"") tall, was discovered by photographer Herbert Tobias while she worked as a sales person at the KaDeWe department store. He supposedly gave her the nickname Nico after his lover, the Greek movie maker Nikos Papatakis. At first, she called herself both Christa Nico and Nico Otzak, but settled for Nico. The modelling career soon set off for the statuesque brunette-turned-blonde, which allowed her to work in Berlin, Paris, London and Rome. Already in the late 1950s she had an unprecedented modelling career for a German (with a contract with the Eileen Ford Agency), which enabled her to buy a house for her mother (already suffering from Parkinson's) on Ibiza in 1962. And it was in Rome where she had her first movie appearance as 'Nico' in [a463623]'s 'La dolce vita'. In 1959 she moved to Paris where she had an affair with [a=Alain Delon] and in 1962 gave birth to her only son, the troubled [a949333] whose father never acknowledged him.

In London she met [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Brian+Jones+(5)]Brian Jones[/url] and recorded her first single [r1171100], produced by Rolling Stones manager [a=Andrew Loog Oldham]. While modeling in New York, [a=Bob Dylan] introduced her to [a=Andy Warhol] and [a39766]. She sang three songs on the Velvet Underground's debut LP and played roles in several Warhol films. Following the release of her debut album, [m35096], her friend [a=Jim Morrison] encouraged her to write her own material.

She toured extensively in Europe, United States, Australia and Japan in the 1980s. After a concert in Berlin in June 1988, she went on holiday in Ibiza to rest. There she fell dead off a bicycle while taking a ride. At the time it happened, the story was that she was already dead from a stroke (brain hemmorhage) falling off the bike, whereas the narrative nowadays has been changed to ""an accident"" after which she died. Her ashes are buried at Friedhof Grunewald-Forst in Berlin at a place historically known as ""Cemetery of the Unknown"" or ""The Suicide Cemetery""."

260571.0,282112.0,3318043,US,Carl Wilson,Youngblood,1983,37.75,11,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']",['Rock'],['Pop Rock'],"Carl Wilson (born December 21, 1946, Hawthorne, California, USA – died February 6, 1998, Los Angeles, California, USA) was an American rock and roll singer and guitarist, best known as a founding member, lead guitarist and sometime lead vocalist of [a70829]. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. He was the youngest brother of fellow band members [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/189718-Brian-Wilson]Brian[/url] and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/391245-Dennis-Wilson-2]Dennis[/url], and cousin of [a372789]. Son of [a363017] and [a3239364]. Uncle of [a434651] and [a413862].

Like most members of The Beach Boys, Carl was a multi-instrumentalist, playing lead, rhythm, bass, and acoustic guitars, keyboards, and occasionally drums onstage.

After his elder brother Brian's retirement from the stage in 1965, Carl became the de facto leader of the band onstage, and shortly after became the band's in-studio leader, producing the bulk of the 1967-1973 albums ""Smiley Smile, Friends"", ""20/20"", ""Wild Honey"", ""Surf's Up"", [a2415580] - ""So Tough"", and ""Holland"".

Carl's leadership role in the band diminished somewhat in the late 1970's, both due to Brian's brief re-emergence as the band's producer and Carl's own substance abuse problems. He nonetheless remained a prominent and recognizable voice in the band, taking lead vocals on many songs and serving as ""mixdown producer"" on the Brian-produced ""Love You"" album. By the time of recording of 1979's ""L.A. (Light Album)"", Carl again found himself filling the vocal and songwriting gap left by a retreating Brian Wilson.

As a lead vocalist Carl was the last member of the group to be assigned lead vocals to sing.  His first turn at the solo mic was on 1964's ""Pom-Pom Playgirl"", from ""Shut Down Vol. 2"".  Over the years he has been considered one of the greatest singers in pop/rock, deftly handling ballads such as ""God Only Knows"", pop gems like ""I Can Hear Music"", and rock and rollers including ""Darlin'"" and ""Keeping The Summer Alive"".  On tour, particularly in the late 1960's and 1970's, his extraordinary voice often replaced that of his brother Brian's on songs originally sung by the latter, including ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""Surfer Girl"", and ""Let The Wind Blow"".

Carl was not the most controversial member of the band.  To his credit, his quiet, private life endured only two ripples: first, in the late 1960's, he emerged victorious from a fight with the US government over his Conscientious Objector status regarding the Vietnam draft (he and the band agreed to play a number of free benefit concerts in lieu of Carl being drafted); second, in the late 1970's he appeared on a television simulcast concert in Australia with The Beach Boys while inebriated (he later explained it away as a reaction to flu medicine).  

By the early 1980's The Beach Boys were in disarray. Frustrated with the band's sluggishness to record new material and reluctance to rehearse for live shows, Carl Wilson took a leave of absence in 1981, rather than remain as part of what he saw increasingly becoming a nostalgia act. Thence, he released a 1981 solo album, ""Carl Wilson"", to little critical notice, with songs co-written with [a360015] - particularly the extraordinary ""Heaven"" and the radio hit ""Hurry Love"". He recorded a second solo album, 1983's ""Youngblood"", in a similar vein, but by the time it was released he had already rejoined The Beach Boys. Although ""Youngblood"" did not chart, a single, the [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/987261-John-Joseph-Hall]John Hall[/url] and [a604946] penned ""What You Do To Me,"" did, and it took on new meaning after the death of brother Dennis in December 1983. Youngblood also featured a cover of [a260458]'s ""Rockin' All Over The World"", which he performed on tour with The Beach Boys in the 1980's.

During his brother Brian's mental health struggles and in-and-out participation in the band in the 1980's, particularly after the death of brother Dennis, Carl was closely involved in the legal and moral support of Brian, and was a key player in supporting Brian's second wife Melinda in the ousting of controversial psychologist [a1057138] from Brian's affairs.

Carl was diagnosed with brain and lung cancer in early 1997. Despite his illness and chemotherapy treatments, he continued to perform after diagnosis. Carl played through The Beach Boys' entire summer tour ending in the fall of 1997. Carl Wilson lost his battle with cancer on February 6, 1998, just two months after the death of his mother, Audree. He was survived by his brother Brian, wife Gina (daughter of [a10533]) and two sons [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/5454595-Justyn-Wilson]Justyn[/url] and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/6438151-Jonah-Wilson]Jonah[/url] from his first marriage to Annie Hinsche (sister of [a299166] member, [a311944], who was a mainstay of the Beach Boys' support band on tour).

A handful of additional recordings of Wilson have been released as the album ""Like a Brother"", by ""supergroup"" [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/274822-Gerry-Beckley]Beckley[/url]-[url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/529946-Robert-Lamm]Lamm[/url]-Wilson, comprising Carl Wilson, Gerry Beckley of [a249829] and Robert Lamm of [a114483].

After a self-financed single in 1979, the band released a second in 1980 on the Aardvark label, after which Mick Fidler (vocals, guitar, saxophone) was added. Two further singles followed in 1981, before Ashley left, with Gouldthorpe taking over on vocals and Simon Hinkler (formerly of TV Product) joining on keyboards and guitar. They received support from John Peel, for whom they recorded their first session for his BBC Radio 1 show in July 1981, recording a second early the following year. They signed to the Red Flame label in 1982, releasing a single and the Dale Griffin-produced mini-LP Oceans that year. Their track ""Into the Garden"" reached number nine in the 1982 Festive Fifty. They were often compared to Joy Division, although Gouldthorpe stated ""We never listened to Joy Division – they were never an influence"". Further lineup changes followed, with John White replacing Fidler, who was sacked for missing rehearsals, Christopher Hendrick replacing MacKenzie, and David Hinkler joining on keyboards. The band was reduced to a trio of Gouldthorpe, Wilson, and Hendrick by the time of the release of their second album, One Afternoon in a Hot Air Balloon (1983), with White leaving to form UV Pop and Simon Hinkler moving into production. Simon and David Hinkler and Garry Wilson all played in Pulp around 1983. In 1984 Hendrick left, with MacKenzie returning, and the band moved on to the Golden Dawn label, adding Murray Fenton to the lineup. A third album, The Second Coming, was released in 1984. Simon Hinkler briefly returned, with band manager Tony Perrin added on bass. A live album was released in 1985, by which time the band had split up, after Fenton had joined The Batfish Boys.

Gouldthorpe and Simon Hinkler collaborated on a further album, Flight Commander Solitude & the Snake in 1986, and Hinkler went on to join The Mission. They collaborated on a second album, A Room Full of This, in 1992, working together under the name The Flight Commander.

A compilation of demos, live tracks and interviews, Afterwards, was released in 1989 on the Pleasantly Surprised label.

Gouldthorpe moved away from music to run his own hair salon, stating in 2009 ""I lost it with music for a bit and went into dark corners"".

The band reformed in 2007 after being invited to perform at the Meltdown Festival by long-time fan Jarvis Cocker, and recorded a session for Marc Riley's BBC 6 Music show. The band stayed together, releasing the Standing Still EP in 2009. In 2010 they decided to split up again after David Hinkler decided to leave, but continued after recruiting James Bacon to replace him. A new album, Civilisation, was released in October 2011.

His career has covered a wide range of musical activities, and he is still active in the music industry. In recent years he has expanded into photography.

From 1966 to 1970, Fisher played the organ with the soul/pop band, The Soul Survivors, who in 1967 renamed themselves Love Affair. They had a number one hit single in 1968 with ""Everlasting Love"", while Fisher was taking a break from the band to complete his final year at Hendon County Grammar school. Between 1972 and 1973 he formed the progressive rock band called Morgan, with singer Tim Staffell (the lead singer of the band Smile, who later became Queen). From 1973 to 1976, after a brief liaison with Third Ear Band, he joined British rock band Mott the Hoople. Meanwhile, Fisher contributed keyboards to John Fiddler's Medicine Head, and when Mott folded, Fisher invited Fiddler to join the remaining members of Mott in what would become British Lions. In 1980, Fisher conceived and produced the unique [m1733668] project with two volumes released in 1980 & 2000. And he played with Queen on their 1982 tour of Europe.

In 1985, Fisher moved to Japan, and started to make ambient and improvised music. He became a tv commercial music songwriter, including songs written or arranged for Cat Power, Karin Krog, José Feliciano, Zap Mama and Swing Out Sister. Japanese artists he has worked with include Yoko Ono, Dip in the Pool, The Boom, Heat Wave, Shoukichi Kina, Haruomi Hosono and Kokoo. Starting in November 2003 Morgan performed 100 monthly solo improvisation concerts at the cutting-edge arts/music club Superdeluxe in Roppongi, Tokyo. He called this concert series Morgan's Organ, and has started to release live recordings of the series as downloads. The series ended in March 2013 and has been continued as Morgan's Organ At Home at his personal studio in Tokyo since June 2013. Fisher has maintained a lifelong interest in photography and in recent years has been holding an increasing number of solo exhibitions of his work in Japan and abroad. He has evolved a technique of abstract photography which he calls Light Art."

He left Gong at the time of [m=25501] and started a solo career.

Hillage evolved from prodigy to virtuoso and the guitar sound evolved with echoes and reverb blending with synthesizers. he was a pioneer in new age ambient music and retired from recording for a while as he went on to be a prominent producer in the early 1980's, most known for his work on the Simple Minds albums of that era. Some years later he was in a club and heard The Orb sampling his music and hooked up with them. As a result he resurfaced with his longtime partner [a39787] as System 7 (aka 777 due to concerns from Apple over their operating system at the time).

The band recorded their first album Playing in the City in 1981 at Chapel Lane Studios just outside Hereford. The band were one of the first fully professional Christian rock (CR) bands in the United Kingdom, all members having worked as professional musicians in mainstream rock and pop.

The band signed to the fledgling Chapel Lane label that had just been started by Rob Andrews, owner of Chapel Lane Studios. This was a bold attempt to produce CR recordings that matched professional secular standards and also raise Christian rock's profile.

The band toured the album extensively throughout the UK, Europe and Scandinavia on major tours supporting Larry Norman. Barratt Band was featured on Larry Norman's 1981 live Friends on Tour album, along with Alwyn Wall. In their own right they embarked on smaller club tours, the highlight being the 1982 Greenbelt Festival held at Knebworth, where they headlined the closing night.

Larry Tomaso replaced Tim Hatwell on bass in 1982 and the band appeared on numerous tours and albums supporting or backing some of the top CR artists of the day from the USA and UK, including Larry Norman, Steve Camp, Phil Keaggy, Jesse Dixon and Sheila Walsh.

The band released a second album in 1984 named Voice with Dave Engel on drums.

The heavy touring and work schedules took their toll resulting in one of the band members collapsing through exhaustion while on tour in Scandinavia towards the end of 1986.

Although the band has never officially split up, it never toured or recorded again."

Fronted by Maire Ni Bhraonain AKA [a=Maire Brennan], who recreated her vocals from ""Theme From Harry's Game"" for [a=Chicane]'s hit ""Saltwater"".

'Theme From Harry's Game' was released in the winter of 1982. Radio programmers and audiences were captivated by the dense harmonies and the Gaelic words. It leapt into the Top five in the UK charts. The 'Magical Ring' album followed in 1983, and by now brothers Pol and Ciaran were writing evocative and powerful music. This was furthered on 'Legend' a soundtrack commissioned for the television series, 'Robin Of Sherwood' in 1984. During this period, the band received numerous awards including an Ivor Novello and a BAFTA for their ground-breaking work on this album.

This primed the band for one of their most mesmeric records. 'Macalla', released in 1985, featured more electronic arrangements, while Maire's voice was reaching the extremes of joy and melancholy. A chance remark to their friends in U2 resulted in Bono singing a duet with Maire on the track 'In A Lifetime'. This charted twice, in 1986 and again in 1989. The follow-up, 'Sirius' was completed in Los Angeles with some of the city's most famous musicians, as the Clannad sound took another unscripted change.

'PastPresent', released in 1989 brought the music of Clannad to an even bigger audience. Summarising their first four RCA albums it became a much-loved fixture in the UK chart eventually going Top 5. The BBC had obviously noted the huge success of the soundtrack to Robin and commissioned a project that would become the outstanding album 'Atlantic Realm'. This was followed in the same year by Clannad's first soundtrack work on an animation, 'Angel And The Soldier Boy'.

Maire, Padraig and Noel were writing more now, supplementing Ciaran's work. The latter was also honing his skills as a producer. Their 'Anam' album made the top 20 in 1990. 'Theme From Harry's Game' featured on the 1992 film Patriot Games, featuring Harrison Ford, raising the band's profile again in America. The band's music was increasingly in demand for soundtrack work, appearing on Last Of The Mohicans, (1992) and Message In A Bottle (1999)."

Born on 8 May 1944 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, Gadd started his recording career as [a809714] in 1960, although a succession of singles under this name (and later as Paul Monday) made little impact.

Although his only major hit state-side, it was the first of many in the UK, under the guidance of [l364229].

Glitter's releases were, for the most part, fairly basic, but were made successful by his bravado and strutting showmanship. The hits dried up in the mid-70s, though he remained in the public eye via live performances and a 1984 comeback ""Another Rock N Roll Christmas"", as well as being sampled by (and appearing on TV with) The Timelords for their 1988 chart-topper ""Doctorin' The Tardis"". He went into semi-retirement in the 1990s, putting most of his musical energy into his annual Christmas gigs.

Born 3 October 1938 in Albert Lea, Minnesota, USA, died 17 April 1960 in Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK.
Influential on later artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and many others. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).
Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California. Cochran became musician as a teenager, with a circle of friends that included Connie ""Guybo"" Smith whose nickname would later become one of his song titles. He teamed up with [a=Hank Cochran] (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools. They later called themselves [a=The Cochran Brothers], touring the south-western states and appearing on the California Hayride show. They recorded two hillbilly records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting [a=Elvis Presley] on the Dallas Big D Jamboree show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise"", their third recording on Ekko and a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of [a=Jerry Capehart].
In 1956 Cochran teamed up with Capehart and was signed to [l=Liberty] in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross, spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as [l=Crest], [l=Zephyr], Crash, [l=Vik], along with [l=Silver Records (9)], on which he recorded ""Guybo"", also known as ""Drum City"". He also appeared in two films.
Following up on his increasing American success, Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with [a=Gene Vincent] and [a=Ronnie Hawkins] to appear on popular TV and radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon [a=Shari Sheeley], later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.
On Sunday, April 17, 1960 — the day following the tour — Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car, also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat, and driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lamppost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs and collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries, aged 21. Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother [a=Bob Cochran], entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock'n'roll come of age in the UK."

When Billy Bragg stood in for John Peel on BBC Radio 1, he ended the show with ""...And for those of you who have written to me asking for The Smiths, who are a bit worried about what records you're going to take away to college with you when you go away for the first time, this is my candidate for your turntables. Singing a song that also expresses a lot of my sentiments: Clive Product, Songs From An Untidy Bedroom"". Thus it was that Clive Product became the second artist after Billy Bragg to appear on Utility Records. Billy's 1983 album Life's A Riot with Spy vs Spy had been the label's first release (UTIL 1), but there wasn't a UTIL 2 until Financial Suicide in 1989. By then Utility was owned by Billy and Peter Jenner and they were trying to showcase independent acts which had tried hard, but so far failed, to break through. Clive fitted the bill perfectly, having already released four albums, to no appreciable commercial success.

Since 1990 Clive has lived in Berlin, Germany. Clive currently spends much of his time working in music therapy, as well as drawing and writing the occasional song."

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

Started by Chris Hamlin in Cheltenham in late 1980.  He recruited multi-instrumentalist Roger Freeman, (an old friend from his hometown Birmingham) along with Chris Lee (trumpet) and James Johnstone (guitar / alto sax).  Later Andrew ""Chip"" Carpenter (drums) and Mark Smith (bass) both old school mates of James and former members of his previous band Hardware, were recruited for informal rehearsals.  It was at these jam sessions that their first hit was developed, from an idea Hamlin had before the band was formed.
Simon Underwood, previously of [a33932] was invited to join, along with his old friend and tenor sax player Ollie Moore.  Simon's connections with manager Dick O'Dell landed their first gig, supporting [a33930] at Bristol's Romeo and Juliets.  Based on the crowd's enthusiastic response to a 20 minute performance of their first song, O'Dell invited them to record the track for his label [l=Y Records] the very next day.
Their first single, ""[url=/release/76841]Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag[/url]"", was released in 1981 on Dick O'Dell's Y Records, taking inspiration for the title (if not the music) from [a=James Brown]'s ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/367153]Papa's Got A Brand New Bag[/url]"". The instrumental release quickly became an underground dance hit, selling many thousands of copies and appearing high in the independent charts.  Feeling that he had created and lost control of a 'monster' with too many egos to contend with, Hamlin abandoned the band.
April 1982 saw the release of their first album ""[url=/release/135289]Dr. Heckle & Mr Jive[/url]"", which was massively successful topping the indie charts for several weeks.  A major college tour followed in the spring which put a lot of stress on the band, particularly Roger Freeman.  ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/248337]Papa's[/url]"" was re-released, receiving club play and making the UK charts, peaking at number 3.  The band also made two appearances on ""Top of the Pops"" on April 8th & 22nd.  Freeman departed before the first (turning up later in [a=Dr. Calculus]).
A new lineup, including Brian Nevill and Oscar Verden, began rehearsals on April 27th, following up with ""[url=/release/323660]The Big Bean[/url]"" (which peaked at number 40) and a tour of the UK, Europe, New York and Japan.

In 1983, Angela and Simon Underwood were married at Hammersmith Registry Office with notables from the music scene in attendance, including [a=John Lydon] (aka Johnny Rotten).
A single, ""[url=/release/76820]Hit The 'O' Deck[/url]"" and the album ""[url=/release/144141]Lend An Ear[/url]"" were released in 1983, followed by a final tour of UK and Europe.

They returned to Australia in 1985 for six months (Turner quit and reconvened his earlier group Fungus Brains; he would later form Dirty Three) and then travelled again to the UK. During this time they toured extensively through Northern Europe and also made a short tour of the United States. In 1985 they recorded an EP for Creation Records. In 1986 they released two EPs on the TIM label.

Britain's most successful home-grown pop star, he has had more than 130 singles, albums and EP's make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist.  He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with [a27518]) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's–2000's).

He was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, ""The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook""."

Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768].

Britain's most successful home-grown pop star, he has had more than 130 singles, albums and EP's make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist.  He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with [a27518]) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's–2000's).

He was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, ""The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook""."

After three albums with Ariola-Hansa, they switched to Virgin Records in 1980 and found their fortunes dramatically improving thanks to the surge of popularity in the New Romantic movement.

Rob Dean left the band after Gentlemen Take Polaroids but continued working with the band for one more tour thereafter.

Disagreements between Karn and Sylvian undermined the band's progress just as they were achieving some long-overdue success, and they split in late 1982.

They are regarded as a catalyst of the new wave of Welsh rock in the early '80s.
The band was formed in by vocalist David R. Edwards and instrumentalist T. Wyn Davies in 1982 while they were at Ysgol Uwchradd in Aberteifi, with instrumentalist Patricia Morgan joining in 1984.Edwards' lyrics were almost entirely in the Welsh language, the subject matter reflecting his ""extreme disillusionment"" with life in Wales in the early 1980s era under Margaret Thatcher.After four cassette-only releases on Casetiau Neon, the band had their first vinyl release in 1987 on Anhrefn Records, with the Hwgr-Grawth-Og EP featuring just Edwards and Morgan, which was picked up by John Peel and led to a session being recorded for his BBC Radio 1 show (the first of five such sessions). While Welsh radio gave the band little airplay, they also found an outlet through Geraint Jarman's Fideo 9 television show on S4C. The band's first album, Wyau (Eggs), was released in 1988, and was followed two years later with Pyst (Posts) on the Ofn label. Davies left in 1990 and the group continued as a duo for a while, before being augmented by a series of musicians, notably drummer Al Edwards. Moving to Ankst Records, the Christmas-themed Blwch Tymer Tymor cassette was issued in 1991. Edwards collaborated with Tŷ Gwydr and Llwybr Llaethog on the 1992 album LL.LL v T.G. MC DRE, before releasing a final Datblygu album in 1993 with Libertino.After a single, ""Alcohol""/""Amnesia"" in 1995, the band split up.

In August 2008 a new 7"" single ""Can y Mynach Modern"" (The Song of the Modern Monk) was released. The song recounts (over its brief ninety seconds) the turmoil and madness that engulfed Edwards as the band fell apart in the mid nineties and the long road to recovery that resulted from the fallout. The track is intended as a full stop on their legacy rather than a brand new start. Datblygu have been cited as a major influence on the generation of Welsh bands that followed, including Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Super Furry Animals (who covered Datblygu's ""Y Teimlad"" on their Mwng album).
In a rare TV appearance, David featured on S4C documentary programme O Flaen dy Lygaid in 2009, presented by Cardiff-based broadcaster and friend of David's, Ali Yassine, which followed David and his battle to recover from mental illness. The programme also featured Datblygu bandmember and former Pobol y Cwm actress Ree Davies and her own battle against mental illness. In 2012 an exhibition celebrating the band's history was held in a Cardiff coffee shop. Edwards and Morgan reunited in 2012 for the EP Darluniau'r Ogof Unfed Ganrif ar Hugain. A new mini-album, Erbyn Hyn, was released in June 2014 and a new album, Porwr Trallod (Tribulation Browser), in December 2015. In 2017 David released a series of poems for the very first time in his second language English compiled in a book called ""Search In English For The House Of Tolerance"", released with an accompanying CD of the book audio read with music by Ashley Cooke on the small Welsh label Recordiau Prin.

Edwards passed away in June 2021.

The Passage were formed in March 1978 by Richard 'Dick' Witts together with Tony Friel and Lorraine Hilton. For Witts and Friel the band was extra-curricular, with Friel still playing bass in The Fall, and Witts juggling a post as music and dance officer for Merseyside Arts Association with a stint co-presenting What's On for Granada TV. Prior to this, Witts had trained as a classical percussionist and briefly played with the prestigious Hallé Orchestra; he was also a founder member of the Manchester Musicians' Collective.

Early Passage dates included a show at Eric's Club in Liverpool with Joy Division as support. '[r=810982]' was released on 7"" in December and featured two tracks apiece by Friel and Witts, with Love Song in particular raising eyebrows by virtue of an uncompromising lyric ('I love you/cos I need a cunt/I love you/to use you back and front') misconstrued by some as misogyny, although 'New Love Songs' sold a staggering 3,000.

Still a part-time group, the second Passage EP '[r=845728]' (OM 08) was produced by David Cunningham of Flying Lizards, and again featured two songs each by Tony Friel and Dick Witts. Recorded over two days, the standout track was an early version of 16 Hours, an intense meditation by Witts and Friel on infatuation. Indeed the EP was almost a concept record, with 16 Hours, Taking My Time, Clock Paradox and Time Delay all dealing with various aspects of the passage of time - a fixation repeated on the Contact EP involving Friel. However, About Time sold fewer copies than the first Passage EP, and following a London date with Cabaret Voltaire early in 1980 Friel left. For a brief period Lorraine Hilton's sister Martine joined on bass, although after Witts was injured in a car crash band activity was put on hold.

By the time The Passage recorded their debut album '[r=845692]' in July 1980, the group consisted of Dick Witts alone. Self-produced on eight-track equipment at Graveyard in just 70 tense hours, OBJ 011 made up in bile and bite what it lacked in production gloss. Standout tracks included a powerful version of 16 Hours, the brooding Watching You Dance and the memorable Troops Out, which despite an overt political agenda hinted that Witts was quite capable of writing a bona fide pop hit.

In due course The Passage expanded to become a trio, and recorded three further albums (For All & None, Degenerates and Enflame) as well as singles such as Taboos, XOYO and Wave. Today Witts is an academic, having published a history of the Arts Council in 1998, and lectures on modern music in London and Edinburgh.

A British instrumental quartet, Dif Juz consisted of brothers Dave & Alan Curtis (both guitarists), bassist Gary Bromley and drummer/occasional sax player Richard Thomas. In a recorded interview for Radiobombast (WRFI Community Radio, Ithaca, NY) Richard Thomas explained their name was a random result from use as a place-holder name for booking studio time, but they liked how people interpreted it in various ways. They released two seminal EPs; [r=381650] and [r=381643] in 1981 on the then fledgling 4AD label.  The band then departed 4AD for the label Red Flame in 1983 where they released an experimental mini LP [r=381598], following this they toured extensively through 1984 and 1985 supporting [a=Cocteau Twins] and [a=Wolfgang Press] before returning to 4AD to record their first full-length LP [r=383702] which featured contributions by Cocteau Twins Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) and Robin Guthrie (production). Shortly thereafter Dif Juz were introduced to Jamaican dub innovator [a=Lee Perry] and served as his backing band for a series of shows before eventually attempting to make a record together. The five tracks that were recorded - including a nine-minute version of ""The Mighty Quinn"" - never quite gelled, despite Robin Guthrie's attempts to mix them and the collaboration remains unreleased. 

With the exception of a reissued and re-recorded Huremics and Vibrating Air (respectively) in the form of [r=381633] and a contribution to the 1986 4AD compilation [r=159986] the band effectively disappeared, though the members remained active separately; the Curtis brothers and Ritchie Thomas both recorded parts for [a=This Mortal Coil]'s [r=184972] album, whilst Thomas would also appear that year on the Cocteau Twins/Harold Budd collaboration [r=77098] playing drums and saxophone. He and Dave Curtis also contributed to The Wolfgang Press' albums [r=260855] and [r=104397], respectively. 
It is rumoured that the band's 'final' dissolution came when Richard Thomas became a touring drummer for [a=The Jesus And Mary Chain], though the band never officially split up.

After many years of silence, the posthumous release by 4AD of Huremics and Vibrating Air appeared in the form of [r=237958] in 1999. Coinciding with the album was the creation of a website which appeared to be created by the band. This page ran the banner ""By us about us"", as well as ""More soon"" though this never materialized.

He recruited multi-instrumentalist Roger Freeman, (an old friend from his hometown Birmingham) along with Chris Lee (trumpet) and James Johnstone (guitar / alto sax).  Later Andrew ""Chip"" Carpenter (drums) and Mark Smith (bass) both old school mates of James and former members of his previous band Hardware, were recruited for informal rehearsals.  It was at these jam sessions that their first hit was developed, from an idea Hamlin had before the band was formed.
Simon Underwood, previously of [a33932] was invited to join, along with his old friend and tenor sax player Ollie Moore.  Simon's connections with manager Dick O'Dell landed their first gig, supporting [a33930] at Bristol's Romeo and Juliets.  Based on the crowd's enthusiastic response to a 20 minute performance of their first song, O'Dell invited them to record the track for his label [l=Y Records] the very next day.
Their first single, ""[url=/release/76841]Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag[/url]"", was released in 1981 on Dick O'Dell's Y Records, taking inspiration for the title (if not the music) from [a=James Brown]'s ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/367153]Papa's Got A Brand New Bag[/url]"". The instrumental release quickly became an underground dance hit, selling many thousands of copies and appearing high in the independent charts.  Feeling that he had created and lost control of a 'monster' with too many egos to contend with, Hamlin abandoned the band.
April 1982 saw the release of their first album ""[url=/release/135289]Dr. Heckle & Mr Jive[/url]"", which was massively successful topping the indie charts for several weeks.  A major college tour followed in the spring which put a lot of stress on the band, particularly Roger Freeman.  ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/release/248337]Papa's[/url]"" was re-released, receiving club play and making the UK charts, peaking at number 3.  The band also made two appearances on ""Top of the Pops"" on April 8th & 22nd.  Freeman departed before the first (turning up later in [a=Dr. Calculus]).
A new lineup, including Brian Nevill and Oscar Verden, began rehearsals on April 27th, following up with ""[url=/release/323660]The Big Bean[/url]"" (which peaked at number 40) and a tour of the UK, Europe, New York and Japan.
New York vocalist [a=Angela Jaeger], previously of [url=/artist/Drowning+Craze]The Drowning Craze[/url], joined for the next LP, ""Lend An Ear,"" recorded in late summer 1982, followed by a Christmas ""Top of the Pops"" appearance.  In 1983, Angela and Simon Underwood were married at Hammersmith Registry Office with notables from the music scene in attendance, including [a=John Lydon] (aka Johnny Rotten).
A single, ""[url=/release/76820]Hit The 'O' Deck[/url]"" and the album ""[url=/release/144141]Lend An Ear[/url]"" were released in 1983, followed by a final tour of UK and Europe.

Elvis Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including rock 'n' roll, pop, country and gospel, he is one of the best-selling music artists in the history of recorded music. He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into a.o. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Country Music Hall of Fame, Rockabilly Hall of Fame and Gospel Hall of Fame. 
He is often referred to as ""The King of Rock and Roll"", or simply, ""The King"".

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].
The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.
In 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).
They were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.
However, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.

Spending her childhood in Reading, Berkshire, Oldfield studied ballet from the age of four and won numerous competitions in all styles of dance, including ballet, tap and modern. At the age of eleven, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dancing, then located in Holland Park, London, and two years later was starred to move on to the Royal Ballet School at White Lodge. However, she gave up ballet two years later, and achieved three A-Levels at Grade A. She studied classical piano to Grade 7. All her school years were spent at St Joseph's Convent School, Reading, where she became friends with Marianne Faithfull. Oldfield read English Literature and Philosophy at Bristol University.

Oldfield's musical career started in early 1968, when she made some demo recordings with her younger brother Mike Oldfield. These sessions were suggested and overseen by Mick Jagger. It is not known what became of those recordings.

Soon after this she founded the folk music duo The Sallyangie together with her brother Mike. The duo was signed to Transatlantic Records and recorded their only album at the recommendation of Pentangle band guitarist, John Renbourn, whom Oldfield met at the Troubadour Folk Club in Bristol. The album Children of the Sun was recorded in August 1968. The songs on it are mainly co-written by Sally and Mike Oldfield, and the album contained some of her brother's early guitar work. Guesting were Terry Cox on drums and Ray Warleigh on flute.

Eminently unfashionable in the UK punk era, they first found success in Japan.

After three albums with Ariola-Hansa, they switched to Virgin Records in 1980 and found their fortunes dramatically improving thanks to the surge of popularity in the New Romantic movement. Japan's androgynous image made them suddenly fashionable and they registered several UK Top 20 singles. Their albums Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) and Tin Drum (1981) were also well received.  Rob Dean left the band after Gentlemen Take Polaroids but continued working with the band for one more tour thereafter.

Disagreements between Karn and Sylvian undermined the band's progress just as they were achieving some long-overdue success, and they split in late 1982.  The members diversified into collaborative work and solo careers, reuniting (minus Dean) in 1991 for a project under the moniker of Rain Tree Crow."

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

The name is a contradiction in terms, “Violent” being self-explanatory and “Femmes” being Milwaukee slang for wimp.
The rhythm section added high school singer/songwriter Gordon Gano in 1981. Gano and Ritchie had previously performed together at Gano’s National Honor Society induction ceremony, where they caused a near riot. Gano was expelled from the Society and suspended from high school for this outrage. 
One of the only stable aspects of the band is their aversion to rehearsal. Due to this they would take the music to the streets in an attempt to hone it and earn some spare change. It was on one of these occasions that they were spotted by the Pretenders. Chrissie Hynde and the gang were so amused by the Violent Femmes antics that they invited the band to open the show for them. The hometown Milwaukee audience received the Femmes with unanimous booing. However by the end of the set the Femmes had converted approximately 50% of the audience to their cause. Many years later Brian Ritchie encountered Hynde when the Femmes and Pretenders shared the bill at a radio concert. She said, “Oh, you’re still around.”
The Femmes borrowed $10,000 from Victor De Lorenzo’s dad to record their legendary first album in 1982. Slash Records in Los Angeles was the only label to offer them a deal with the amazing advance of $0. The band accepted the deal and started on the predictable round of world tours, recording, more world tours, nervous breakdowns, band members quitting, solo albums, regrouping, more touring, divorces, more crackups, dropped from record deals, new deals, more touring, record company going bankrupt, lawsuits, etc. etc. etc. ad infinitum. 
Fast forward to the present. Many things have changed. One thing that hasn’t is the sound of the band. Their loose, improvisational, acoustic sound is timeless.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

The group was led by Justin ""Slade The Leveller"" Sullivan (b. 1956, Buckinghamshire, England; guitar, vocals), a former platform sweeper and Mars bar production-line worker, with the help of Stuart Morrow (b. 1966, Bradford, England)  on bass guitar and Phil Tomkins on drums. Within a few months, Tompkins had been replaced on drums by Rob Waddington, and this line-up remained unchanged until the summer of 1982, when Waddington left the band and was replaced by Robert ""Robb"" Heaton (b. 1962, Cheshire, England d. Nov. 4th, 2004), a former drum technician and occasional drummer for the band Hawkwind. This line-up remained together until Morrow left the band for personal reasons, during the band's ""No Rest"" tour, the day after a concert in their home town of Bradford. Which was coincidentally the day of the Bradford disaster, May 11th, 1985  He was replaced on bass in the summer by Jason ""Moose"" Harris (b. 1968).

Their brand of punk folk/rock attracted a loyal cult following, much of which shared the band's grievances towards the Tory government policies of the 80s. This was best executed on their debut album, which combined militant themes such as ""Spirit Of The Falklands"" and ""Vengeance"" (a vitriolic anthem about getting even with one's trespassers) with the haunting lament for childhood, ""A Liberal Education"". The group's championing of traditional working-class ethics saw an unexpected boost for a dying art and trade - that of the clog.

New Model Army made their first public appearance at Scamps Disco in Bradford in October 1980. After releasing singles on Abstract Records, enjoying a number 2 UK independent chart hit with ""The Price"" in 1984, they formed an unlikely alliance with the multinational EMI Records, which saw the band acquire a higher profile and a significantly increased recording budget. 

They eventually broke through to a wider audience with ""No Rest"", which peaked at number 28 on the UK singles chart in 1985 - a position they were never to beat in an impressive run of 12 UK chart singles between 1985 and 1991. With often inflammatory lyrics, the band have never compromised their beliefs for commercial gain. 

They ran into trouble with BBC Television's Top Of The Pops show for donning T-shirts with the (albeit laudable) slogan, ""Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin"". This attracted some derision from ""anarcho-punk"" traditionalists [a251960], who replied with their own motif: ""Only Stupid Bastards Help EMI"". They subsequently continued to release high-quality albums, with considerable crossover potential, always maintaining credibility with their original fanbase. 

In December 1991 the group left EMI, eventually finding a new home on Epic Records. Their first single for the label revealed few concessions to the mainstream: ""Here Comes The War"" featured a picture of a charred body, and a pull-out poster instructing the user in how to prepare a nuclear bomb. In 1994, a dance remix of ""Vengeance' was released as a protest against the Criminal Justice Bill. After a lengthy absence the band reconvened for 1998's ""Strange Brotherhood"". New Model Army's short spell with Epic ended as quickly as it started with the band preferring to self publish and go back to their roots. By 2000 their most recent studio album was ready. Named ""Eight"" it included a now familiar, though no less effective, formula and energy. They continue to release new material and tour as of 2023."

Born: 27 November 1942, Seattle, USA – Died: 18 September 1970, London, UK.

A  self-taught guitarist, Hendrix began his musical career backing such R&B greats as Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and B.B. King. Brought to London from New York by former Animals bassist [a=Chas Chandler], Hendrix quickly established himself as the brightest new star on the burgeoning progressive rock scene of the early '60s. Along with bassist [a=Noel Redding] and drummer [a=Mitch Mitchell] he formed [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/255672-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-The]The Jimi Hendrix Experience[/url].

After a landmark appearance at the Monterey Pop festival, their debut album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Are-You-Experienced/master/24497]Are You Experienced[/url] was released in September 1967. The album, and its 1968 successors - [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Axis-Bold-As-Love/master/24511]Axis: Bold As Love[/url] and the seminal blues-oriented developments of [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Electric-Ladyland/master/24535]Electric Ladyland[/url] - earned Hendrix international acclaim as a premier rock instrumentalist and innovator of his generation. A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."
153073.0,42138.0,10467605,US,Kiss,Animalize,1984,35.7,9,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']",['Rock'],"['Glam', 'Hard Rock']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

They achieved chart success in Australia and New Zealand with their brand of Rock during the 1975 to 1979 period.

Dragon formed in Auckland, New Zealand, in January 1972 with a line-up that featured singer/pianist [a=Graeme Collins], guitarist [a=Ray Goodwin], bassist [a=Todd Hunter] and drummer [a=Neil Reynolds]. All had been in various short-lived bands in Auckland. Collins is credited with using the [i]I Ching[/i] (a.k.a. [i]Yi Jing[/i]) cards to provide the name Dragon. Their first major gig was an appearance at The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival in early January 1973. By 1974 several personnel changes had occurred, with Todd Hunter's younger brother [a=Marc Hunter] joining on vocals and [a=Neil Storey] on drums.

The band recorded two progressive rock albums in their native New Zealand, [i]Universal Radio[/i] (1974) and [i]Scented Gardens for the Blind[/i] (1975) both on Vertigo Records. Despite being New Zealand's top live attraction by late 1974, neither albums nor related singles had any local chart success,and they recruited [a=Robert Taylor (3)] (ex-[a=Mammal (7)]) on guitar as they searched for a raunchier pop sound. By early 1975, manager [a=Graeme Nesbitt] (ex-Mammal), who had obtained regular gigs and organised their first New Zealand tours, felt they should tackle the larger Australian market. Nesbitt was unable to travel with them to Australia – he had been arrested for selling drugs.

Breaking up in December 1979, they reformed in August 1982 and achieved chart success again between 1982 and 1986. From 1982 the line up of the band changed frequently but always included the founding brothers, [a632993] and [a309460]. 

From 1986 onwards they never managed to achieve the same level of success and broke up in November 1997. In 1998 Marc Hunter died of throat cancer.

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"".

TOKYO BLADE proved extremely popular in Europe touring on a regular basis, but failed to ignite sufficient interest in Britain despite steady commendable reviews. Ultimately the band's impetus, provided initially by a crop of strong NWoBHM era singles and albums, was sapped by a series of unstable line ups.
Formerly known as KILLERS , featuring a line up of vocalist Alan Marsh, guitarists Andy Boulton, and Ray Disemore, bassist Andy Robbins and drummer Steve Pierce, the Salisbury group released the demo 'For Serious Applicants Only' in 1981 before adopting the new title of GENGHIS KHAN. As GENGHIS KHAN, the quintet released three singles prior to a further name change to TOKYO BLADE, re-issuing the 'If Heaven Is Hell' single under the new title and, naturally, in new packaging. TOKYO BLADE attracted the attention of the York based Powerstation label and the independent label released the five piece band's self-titled debut album in 1983.

Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

In 2019, further reunion plans were discussed, but the band ended upon the death of Eddie Van Halen on October 6, 2020.

They emerged from Southern California to gain international prominence, touring enough to become a major attraction in virtually every city where a scene existed and undoubtedly inspiring others to get in the game. Via the band's SST label, Black Flag played an essential role in the development and popularization of American punk. Through countless revolving-door personnel changes — which spawned numerous spin-off bands along the way — Black Flag persevered until 1986, finally dissolving after locating and exploring the zone where punk and heavy metal intersect and overlap.

Guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn founded Black Flag in 1976 along with vocalist Keith Morris. They were initially called Panic, adopting the Black Flag moniker a few years later. Ginn remained the only constant member in the band until their split in the summer of 1986. In 2003, Ginn resurrected the Black Flag for a couple shows to benefit cat rescue organizations. These shows featured contributions from some old members as well as new players and reactions were mixed. In January 2013, Ginn announced that he was relaunching the band with vocalist Ron Reyes (the second of 4 vocalists to pass through the group in its initial run) with the intention of extensive touring and recording new material. At the same time, Keith Morris and one-time bassist and SST Records co-founder Chuck Dukowski launched Flag, which also featured former members Bill Stevenson and Dez Cadena as well as Descendents/ALL guitarist Stephen Egerton, to perform the music of Black Flag."

Almost all were students at the Rhode Island School of Design, and lead singers Holmes and Milliken were also romantically involved. Bob Holmes later described the band as ""a cross between Gene Autry and Devo"". Others noted that when Milliken was singing, Rubber Rodeo sounded something like a countrified Blondie. Most of the band's material consisted of original songs composed by Bob Holmes, or by the team of Holmes and Milliken. However, the group also recorded takes on country and western classics such as Ennio Morricone's ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and the Patsy Cline standard ""Walkin' After Midnight"". As well, their first independently released single was a cover of Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" in 1981. Shortly after this single was released, pedal steel guitarist Stern left the band, to be replaced by ""Easy"" Mark Tomeo. After two independent EP releases, on Eat Records, in 1982 and 1983, the band recorded their full-length debut Scenic Views for Mercury Records. The LP's first single ""The Hardest Thing"" video received significant MTV airplay. The album's second video ""Anywhere With You"" also received MTV play, and the ""Anywhere With You"" single was a  hit in the US. Later in 1984, the band picked up a Grammy nomination for a long-form video they made for Scenic Views. The video was produced by Second Story Television and written and directed by David Greenberg. The video release also included the music video for their early Eat Records single, ""How The West Was Won"". Before recording their follow-up album, the band's line-up was reshuffled again. Tomeo departed, to be replaced by Ray Gantek on pedal steel and dobro, and Hal Cragin joined the band, taking over for Doelp on bass. The band's second album, 1986's Heartbreak Highway, was produced by Ken Scott, who had previously produced albums by David Bowie and Devo. The group soldiered on for a while, with Reeves Gabrels taking over from Gantek as Rubber Rodeo's steel guitarist. The band split up by the end of the 1980s, with their final recording appearing on a 1991 tribute album honouring Duplex Planet poetry naif Ernest Noyes Brookings. Holmes and Milliken's marriage also came to an end in the 1990s. Bob Holmes went on to a successful production career for artists ranging from David Bowie to Nils Lofgren. Both Doug Allen and Gary Leib, meanwhile, drew upon their art school backgrounds and became noted cartoonists. Elsewhere, Reeves Gabrels moved to London and joined David Bowie's band Tin Machine."

Similarly, Roxy Music have had success with some of their 49 single/EP releases. In this case, there has been a chart entry for 18 of these releases, with one single making the No.1 spot. In February 1981, Roxy Music hit the singles chart 'top spot' with the John Lennon composed song ‘[m=58331]’ and spent 2 weeks at that coveted position, 9 weeks in the chart’s Top 40 (6 weeks in the Top 10) and 11 weeks overall.

Although the band was formed by guitarist Jay Jay French in December 1972, all of their songs were written by Dee Snider from 1976 onward. 

The soon to be named Twisted Sister was formed after Jay Jay French was added following auditions in the 'band house' located in Ho-Ho-Kus New Jersey in late December 1972. Manhattan resident John Segall (Jay Jay French) auditioned and was asked to join the 'glitter band' Silver Star. Silver Star was the creation of the drummer Mel Anderson (Mell Star) as the New Jersey version of the [a=New York Dolls]. At the same time as Silver Star/Twisted Sister was created, Mell Star's brother, Al Anderson, was the guitar player for [a=Bob Marley & The Wailers]. Jay Jay hated the name Silver Star and pushed to have it changed. On Valentine's Day in February 1973 Silver Star changed its name to Twisted Sister. 

The band found work immediately and started playing 6 nights a week (mostly in the same club for the entire week). They secured a residency at the Mad Hatter in East Quogue, NY for the summer of 1973 and played 105 nights from Memorial Day to Labor day. By December 1974, when this first version of the band broke up, Jay Jay had already played nearly 600 nights and about 3,000 performances as the band played 5 x 40 minutes shows per night, each with costume changes, some ending as late as 8 am the following morning. The second version of the band changed lead singers (Rick Prince) and guitar player (Keith Angel) and continued for a couple of months into 1975 before singer Rick Prince failed to show up for a rehearsal. In the third lineup change, Jay Jay the took over the lead vocal chores and management duties. The band split up after Labor Day weekend 1975. In October 1975 the fourth version of the band started to play the club circuit. Jay Jay hired a former high school friend Eddie Ojeda, who joined as co-lead singer and second guitarist, and got drummer Kevin John Grace after reading an ad that Kevin put in the Village Voice. Bass guitarist Kenny Neill (Kenneth Harrison Neill) remained and completed the lineup. The band followed a glam rock direction. They played at local clubs but floundered in relative anonymity.

In February 1976, at the suggestion of the band's agent, Kevin Brenner, Jay Jay was told that the band could only go so far without being able to play [a=Led Zeppelin] cover songs and urged Jay Jay to hire Danny Snider (Dee Snider). This version lasted 6 weeks before version seven began on April 1st, 1976 with new drummer Tony Petri, the group took a heavier musical direction.

At this point, the bands popularity began to soar as the band, especially Dee and Jay Jay started to talk (rap) to the audience about current topics of the day between songs.

The band went though three more line up changes between 1979 and 1982. Drummer Joey Brighton replaced Tony Petri, former [a=The Dictators] drummer Richie Teeter replaced Brighton and finally AJ Pero replaced Teeter.

The band started its own t-shirt company and record label. They released two singles which eventually made it over to the UK and caught the attention of Martin Hooker, the president of indie label Secret Records. 

In June 1982, the group released its first EP, ""Ruff Cuts"", on the Secret Records label. This was followed shortly by their first studio album, Under the Blade, produced by [a=Pete Way (2)] of [a=UFO (5)]. 

Around this time, Twisted Sister updated its feminized image with a more grotesque look that distinguished them from other glam metal bands of the era. The group was now regarded more as a weird-looking heavy metal band because its look and music, although still reminiscent of pop/glam styles, were growing closer to heavy metal's leather and chains image. At this point [a=Dee Snider] quote should be noted:  ""I don't think Twisted Sister is ""glam"" because that implies glamour, and we're not glamorous. We should be called ""Hid"" because we're hideous.""

After an appearance on the music TV program The Tube, Atlantic Records approached the band and signed them. Their first LP under Atlantic, ""You Can't Stop Rock 'n Roll"", produced by Stuart Epps, was released in 1983 and included the UK #19 hit ""I Am (I'm Me)"".

International fame came for Twisted Sister when the band's third LP, ""Stay Hungry"", hit the stores on May 10, 1984. ""Stay Hungry"" sold more than two million copies by the summer of 1985, and went on to sell more than three million in subsequent years. It remains the band's biggest success.

On November 9th, 1985, the band released its fourth studio album, ""Come Out And Play"", produced by Dieter Dierks. It was not nearly as successful as its predecessor, although it did earn the band a gold album for sales of 500,000 copies.

After the tour, Pero left to rejoin Cities. He was replaced by ex-Good Rats drummer Joey 'Seven' Franco. 

In 1986, Snider embarked on a solo project, reportedly approaching future [a=Iron Maiden] guitarist Janick Gers, but this did not work out.

Snider then recorded an album with Franco programming the drum machine and featuring several session musicians such as Reb Beach on guitar and Kip Winger (just before they formed Winger) and Steve Whiteman of Kix. Atlantic Records refused to release it unless it was labeled as a Twisted Sister album. So, on August 13th, 1987 ""Love Is for Suckers"" made its debut.

On October 12th, 1987, almost two months after the release of ""Love Is For Suckers"", Snider left the band, the record label cancelled its contract, and Twisted Sister disbanded. The public announcement of the band's demise came in January 1988.

After the band's break-up, former members were involved in different projects:

Snider formed Desperado, [a=Widowmaker (2)], and [a=Dee Snider's Sick Mutha Fuckers]. He also wrote and starred in the movie ""Strangeland"".

Ojeda went on to join Scarecrow and then formed Prisoners Of War. Both projects were unsuccessful. He also worked as a session guitarist and guitar instructor.

French stopped performing except for some guest appearances. He formed French Management and produced the alternative metal band Sevendust's first self-titled album.

Mendoza briefly joined Blackfoot. Then he worked as a producer and manager. He also occasionally pursued solo projects.

Pero was involved in several projects and subsequently toured with [a=Dee Snider's Sick Mutha Fuckers].

Franco worked as a session drummer and played with Snider's [a=Widowmaker (2)].

In June 2006, the band announced that they had signed with the American record label Razor and Tie to release a final CD with heavy metal Christmas music called ""A Twisted Christmas"". The CD was released on October 17th, 2006, and was a commercial success. 

The group is still together and occasionally makes small tours around the world, in full makeup. Before each of these mini-tours, they performed as Bent Brother, practicing its set and appearing without makeup, usually at reduced ticket prices.

Former Twisted Sister drummer Richard Teeter, who had played with the band from 1980 to 1981, died of esophageal cancer on April 12th, 2012.
Drummer A.J. Pero died of a heart attack on March 20th, 2015."

Formed early in 1981 (having been briefly named ""The Wait) by school friends Dave Nicholls (Guitar), Nick Jardine (Bass), Clare ""Corny"" Taylor (Vocals) and Kevin Thickett (Drums).
They made their live debut May 11th 1981 at Wednesbury's Holyhead Youth Centre.

The band had difficulty in retaining an accomplished drummer.  After 6 months, Thickett was replaced by Chris Boot who was himself replaced by Allan Higginson.  Sears were briefly joined by a second (male) vocalist in response to an ad place in the weekly music newspaper ""Sounds"".  ""Gnasher"" performed just one gig; at The Roebuck, Erdington, Birmingham UK on November 9th 1981.

Nicholls temporarily left the band in 1982 to be replaced by guitarist ""Taffy"".  It was this line up that recorded the first demo (3 songs) in July 1982.  With Nicholls back (initially in a line-up with two guitars until the inexperienced ""Taffy"" was persuaded to leave), they made their London debut at the Moonlight Club, West Hampsted on September 26th 1982.
The drummer saga continued when Higginson went AWOL to be replaced by James ""Braddo"" Bradley who in turn was replaced by Ian ""Batesy"" Bate.

The line up of ""Corny"" Taylor, Dave Nicholls, Nick Jardine and ""Batesy"" recorded their sole official release ""If Only..."" in June 1984.  It was produced in collaboration with Dick Lucas and Bruce Treasure of Subhumans' for release on Bluurg Records.  The band were disappointed with the recordings. 

Unfortunately, Batesy became ill and left the band to be replaced on drums by Sean ""Faz"" O'Farrell but after a UK tour with Norway's Bannlyst in July 1985, The Sears decided to end.  The final gig was at Sunderland Bunker, September 14th 1985.  

Batesy succumbed to leukemia in May 1986.  There was a one-off reunion at the Anchor, in Wednesbury  on July 19th 1986 as a benefit for his widow.

In 2004/2005,  Corny, Nick and Dave met and re-recorded the tracks from ""If Only..."" in Dave's home studio. "

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Through countless revolving-door personnel changes — which spawned numerous spin-off bands along the way — Black Flag persevered until 1986, finally dissolving after locating and exploring the zone where punk and heavy metal intersect and overlap.

Guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn founded Black Flag in 1976 along with vocalist Keith Morris. They were initially called Panic, adopting the Black Flag moniker a few years later. Ginn remained the only constant member in the band until their split in the summer of 1986. In 2003, Ginn resurrected the Black Flag for a couple shows to benefit cat rescue organizations.

Died: 1st January 1984, London, England.

Alexis Korner was a British blues musician and radio broadcaster. He had travelled with his parents through Switzerland and North Africa before settling in London as a 12 year-old. He grew up listening to the early blues pioneers and his music career as a guitarist and singer really began with engagements in [a1421932] and [a=Chris Barber] bands.

In 1956, Korner met [a1053895] with whom he founded the famed blues club in Ealing and the band [a=Blues Incorporated]. Their aim was to play 'real' and uncompromising blues (probably the first 'electric British blues' bands) becoming a platform for the careers of [a=Mick Jagger], [a409290], [a=Jack Bruce], [a=Charlie Watts], and many others.

Davis left in 1963 and Blues Incorporated disbanded in 1967. The following years saw Korner in many bands, most of them short-lived: [a3134722], [a=New Church] and [a=Snape]. From the late 1960s Korner toured, often as [a1251059] - for instance with [a=Peter Thorup], but mostly with bassist [a=Colin Hodgkinson]. By the late 1970s, Korner gained recognition as a radio DJ and broadcaster, continuing to record sporadically with bands such as [a325864] and Snape. His 50th birthday all-star concert was released as [m=477316]. In 1981, he joined the ""supergroup"" [a1227376], led by [a255182] and based on boogie-woogie keyboard players, which featured a rhythm section comprising Jack Bruce and Charlie Watts, among others, as well as a horn section. Korner died from lung cancer in 1984.

It was a group of amateur musicians with an interest in improvisation. They would meet on occasional weekends at a place called the Arun Leisure Center, where they would play in a rented room without the presence of an audience. 

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The line-up of the group was continually changing, and not all members could make it to every session. Occasionally there were guest musicians - including [a=Paul Kelday]! The 2 constant members were Phil Kelday, who distributed the tapes, and Heather Rolfe, who designed most of the covers.

The band’s dark subject matter, literary references (Eldritch’s lyrics nod to anyone from Shelley to [a227848]), cavernous reverb and black record sleeves led the music press to dub them a “goth rock” act, though the band has always rejected this description.

The debut album *[m=2795]* was not released until 1985, and the lineup that recorded it split soon afterwards. To prevent departing members [a257204] and [a164067] from renaming themselves [a115235], Eldritch hurriedly released his own album under this name; Adams and Hussey instead formed [a99925]. Eldritch then rebooted the Sisters as a duo of himself and bassist [a155571]; the 1987 album *[m=2836]* prominently featured synthesizers. In 1990 the Sisters returned to live performance after a five-year absence, promoting a new album, *[m=61848]*, recorded mainly by Eldritch and guitarist [a238296].

Two further singles followed, before a long feud with record company [l999] began. Although the band, with various lineups, has continued to tour regularly – playing a mix of old and new songs – ever since, there has been no new Sisters release since 1993."

While living in Japan in 1972, he developed an interest in ethnic music, particularly African styles, and decided to try to merge those styles with more traditional Western sounds. He launched the PCO as an outlet for his compositions with this eclectic hybrid approach. He always said that the ""Penguin Cafe"" concept was one that came to him in a dream while he was suffering from food poisoning in the south of France in the summer of 1972, after which he wrote a poem that began, ""I am the proprietor of the Penguin Cafe, I will tell you things at random.""

Ellis left the band in 2000, passing the reins to guitarist [a629600]; when Roberts left the group in 2006 over disagreements during the recording of Suite XVI, Warne was promoted to lead vocalist also, rerecording the tracks already recorded by Roberts alongside Burnel.

After a self-financed single in 1979, the band released a second in 1980 on the Aardvark label, after which Mick Fidler (vocals, guitar, saxophone) was added. Two further singles followed in 1981, before Ashley left, with Gouldthorpe taking over on vocals and Simon Hinkler (formerly of TV Product) joining on keyboards and guitar. They received support from John Peel, for whom they recorded their first session for his BBC Radio 1 show in July 1981, recording a second early the following year. They signed to the Red Flame label in 1982, releasing a single and the Dale Griffin-produced mini-LP Oceans that year. Their track ""Into the Garden"" reached number nine in the 1982 Festive Fifty. They were often compared to Joy Division, although Gouldthorpe stated ""We never listened to Joy Division – they were never an influence"". Further lineup changes followed, with John White replacing Fidler, who was sacked for missing rehearsals, Christopher Hendrick replacing MacKenzie, and David Hinkler joining on keyboards. The band was reduced to a trio of Gouldthorpe, Wilson, and Hendrick by the time of the release of their second album, One Afternoon in a Hot Air Balloon (1983), with White leaving to form UV Pop and Simon Hinkler moving into production. Simon and David Hinkler and Garry Wilson all played in Pulp around 1983. In 1984 Hendrick left, with MacKenzie returning, and the band moved on to the Golden Dawn label, adding Murray Fenton to the lineup. A third album, The Second Coming, was released in 1984. Simon Hinkler briefly returned, with band manager Tony Perrin added on bass. A live album was released in 1985, by which time the band had split up, after Fenton had joined The Batfish Boys.

Gouldthorpe and Simon Hinkler collaborated on a further album, Flight Commander Solitude & the Snake in 1986, and Hinkler went on to join The Mission. They collaborated on a second album, A Room Full of This, in 1992, working together under the name The Flight Commander.

A compilation of demos, live tracks and interviews, Afterwards, was released in 1989 on the Pleasantly Surprised label.

Gouldthorpe moved away from music to run his own hair salon, stating in 2009 ""I lost it with music for a bit and went into dark corners"".

The band reformed in 2007 after being invited to perform at the Meltdown Festival by long-time fan Jarvis Cocker, and recorded a session for Marc Riley's BBC 6 Music show. The band stayed together, releasing the Standing Still EP in 2009. In 2010 they decided to split up again after David Hinkler decided to leave, but continued after recruiting James Bacon to replace him. A new album, Civilisation, was released in October 2011.

As is typical of heavy metal bands with acronym-based names, ""TSA"" may have no meaning, although in a 2003 press release one of the founders claimed that the acronym originally meant ""Tajne Stowarzyszenie Abstynentów"" - ""Teetotallers' Secret Association"" or ""Teetotallers' Anonymous.""

The band formed in 1979 in Opole as an initiative of guitarist Andrzej Nowak. The original line-up additionally included Stefan Machel (guitar), Janusz Niekrasz (bass) and Marek Kapłon (drums). TSA was originally an instrumental band. It won a ""battle of the bands"" during the 1981 Jarocin Festival at which members met Marek Piekarczyk, a singer in Sektor A. He debuted as TSA's vocalist a month later at the Pop Session festival in Sopot.

The band's song ""Zwierzenia kontestatora"" (""Confessions Of A Contestant"") appears in the musical documentary Behind the Iron Curtain, which documents the heavy metal band Iron Maiden's first visit to Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe. The song is used as background music during the scene filmed in the music club Remont.

TSA's song ""Marsz wilków"" (""The Marching Of The Wolves"") is used in the 1983 Polish children's movie Akademia Pana Kleksa (Academy of Mr. Kleks) - a film based on Jan Brzechwa's 1946 book.

The group disbanded on the eve of the 1990s, but came back together in the spring of 2001 to record and performs a 'classical line-up' of music."

Noted for their exploration of blues, rhythm and blues, and rock music, the group consisted of Keith Relf on vocals and harmonica, Paul Samwell-Smith on bass, Chris Dreja on rhythm guitar and later bass when Samwell-Smith left the band, and Jim McCarty on drums. A defining characteristic of the band was its revolving lineup of lead guitarists, starting with [a1459091] in 1963, followed by [a17827] (1963-1965), [a49624] (1965-1966), and lastly, [a180585] (1966-1968).

Their approach to music was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of rock 'n' roll, notably influencing the development of hard rock and psychedelic rock genres. Known for their high-energy performances, they popularized the ""rave-up"" style, where a song builds in tempo and intensity, a technique that later found its way into heavy metal.

In 1992, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as performers, with the band continuing to tour under the leadership of Jim McCarty with a constantly evolving lineup."

Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970's. Though often referred to as ""The Carpenters,"" their name on official releases and press materials was ""Carpenters."" During a period in the 1970's when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time.

Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, their parents decided to move the family west to Los Angeles, California. Richard and Karen originally played jazz, with Karen having an interest in playing the drums. They were briefly known as Spectrum and then Carpenters, where they then recorded for a small label, [l=Magic Lamp Records]. In their move West, they met Lou Adler who introduced them to [a=Herb Alpert], who signed them to his label, [l=A&M Records] in 1969.

While Richard penned compositions with writing partner, [a=John Bettis], many of the duos' hits were written by others and some were cover versions of established hits for other artists, such as [a=The Beatles] and Motown's, [a=The Marvelettes]. Their 1973 album, ""Now and Then."" B-side consists of a 9-song medley of 60's hits recorded like a radio show.

Carpenters' melodic pop, produced a record-breaking run of hits on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen #1 hits on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles (including their #1 hits). To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units.

During their 14-year career, Carpenters recorded 11 albums, five of which contained top 10 singles (""[m=84990],"" ""[m=84975],"" ""[m=84966],"" ""[m=85055]"" and ""[m=85013],"") thirty-one singles, five television specials, and one short-lived television series. They toured the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Belgium. Their recording career ended with Karen's death in 1983 from cardiac arrest due to complications of anorexia nervosa. Extensive news coverage of the circumstances surrounding her death increased public awareness of the consequences of eating disorders. "

They have both written independently outside the band, and together wrote the music for the British sit-com Girls on Top starring Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Ruby Wax and Tracey Ullman.
Difford & Tilbrook was also the name under which the songwriters recorded and toured following the temporary break-up of Squeeze in 1982. That band reunited in 1985 after only one self-titled album had been released from the pair. Having been issued during this brief three-year hiatus, many fans consider Difford & Tilbrook to be the ""lost"" Squeeze album. By 1993 Difford and Tilbrook were the only original members left in Squeeze.
Difford left Squeeze in 1999, and the band toured without him before breaking up later that year. Both Difford and Tilbrook then established independent solo careers beginning in 2000, and have maintained those solo careers even after reforming Squeeze in 2007. Like Steely Dan with Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, Squeeze continues to be whatever rotating band membership assembles around the two songwriters.
Beginning in the summer of 2014 and continuing into 2015, Difford & Tilbrook began touring as a duo, playing Squeeze hits in smaller venues in the UK. Squeeze, still operating as a full band, continued to play occasional festival shows during this time."

In the most of two years of this first Micro Disney's life span, they also recorded a couple of demo's, a radio session, and a pair of songs that were intended as a seven inch record for the same label that made the 'Kampus' record, Reekus records. Reekus finally issued these songs on a 30th anniversary retrospective called 'It's Too Late Too Stop Now' in 2011. One of the radio session tracks was issued on 'Quare Groove Vol 1' by Allchival records in 2018. This early Micro Disney was Ireland's most virulent 'Punk-Funk' band. 

This five piece Micro Disney gigged regularly in Cork and Dublin, along with appearances in other Irish cities and towns - Limerick, Galway and Tralee. The band played just one show off the sod. This was in July of 1981 in Southampton on the English south coast. The band started shedding members in the first months of 1982, and was down to the duo of Cathal and Sean before the summer. This duo is how many outside Ireland first heard Microdisney, as John Peel aired their first duo 'Kabuki' records on his show. The rest is history - that you're already knowing!

It was a group of amateur musicians with an interest in improvisation. They would meet on occasional weekends at a place called the Arun Leisure Center, where they would play in a rented room without the presence of an audience. 

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The line-up of the group was continually changing, and not all members could make it to every session. Occasionally there were guest musicians - including [a=Paul Kelday]! The 2 constant members were Phil Kelday, who distributed the tapes, and Heather Rolfe, who designed most of the covers.

Almost coincidentally, Mel and Steve started making music alongside Mel's recording and writing for The First Things. 

Their first four songs were recorded in a small apartment in Champaign and were released on the Hysterical Records in December, 1983, on the Significant Others cassette. The title was taken from one of the names they considered using for the band. 

The idea for the Arms of Someone New was to combine Mel’s and Steve’s several varied interests in the Beatles, psychedelia, blues, new wave and post-punk to create a sound in which the listener would be enveloped, immersed. They followed up Significant Others two months later with another cassette on Hysterical, Occam’s Razor. It essentially followed the path on which Significant Others had set them.

Their ambitions turned toward a concept album with songs tied together sonically and lyrically, and resulted in the Notes From Underground cassette (released in Germany on Devils Dandy Dogs), their final recording for Hysterical, released April, 1984. "

The band was formed by vocalist [a=King Diamond (2)] and guitarist [a=Hank Shermann] in 1981.  The original MF line-up shared members with another Copenhagen band, Danger Zone, whom Diamond and Shermann were helping out.  By 1982, the ""classic"" Mercyful Fate line up of Diamond, Shermann, guitarist Michael Denner (ex-Brats and Danger Zone), bassist Timi ""Grabber"" Hansen (Danger Zone), and drummer Kim Ruzz was in place. Over the next couple years, the band would release an EP and 2 LPs that would cement their reputation as one the most influential metal bands of the early 1980s.  King Diamond's blasphemous lyrics and theatrical stage presence would have many label the band as part of the 1st wave of black metal, although musically the band was closer to the style of Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  The group split in 1985, as Shermann decided he wanted to pursue a more commercial direction.  King Diamond launched a solo career, taking Denner and Hansen with him, while Kim Ruzz disappeared into the regular world.

The band's legend continued to grow after their split.  In 1993, the classic line up, minus Kim Ruzz, reformed for a new album, ""In The Shadows"".  Hansen dropped out after that release but the group continued on throughout the 1990s.  At the same time, King Diamond kept his own solo career going.  Michael Denner left the band after 1996's ""Into The Unknown"" and Diamond and Sherman continued on with new players.  1999's ""9"" is, to date, the band's last full-length release.  King Diamond has stated that MF has not split up but the band is on hold for the foreseeable future.  In 2009, Diamond, Shermann, Denner, Hansen, and drummer Bjarne Holm (who has played with the group since 1994) reunited to re-record the songs ""Evil"" and ""Curse Of The Pharoah"" for the ""Guitar Hero:  Metallica"" video game.

In 2019, the group announced they would be playing a series of live dates.  The line up would include Diamond, Sherman, Wead, Holm, and bassist Joey Vera (filling in for Timi Hansen, who was battling cancer). Timi Hansen lost his battle with cancer on November 4th, 2019.

The band was formed in 1982, by schoolmates, Brian Canham (vocalist, guitar and keyboards), and Pierre Gigliotti (bass and keyboards). The other two members of the group were, Anthony Argiro (drums) ,and Tony Lugton (guitar and keyboards). The group released their first album called, ""Autumnal Park,"" and the singles released were ""Listening,"" ""Stranger In Me,"" ""Dancing Until Midnight,"" and ""Beat For You."" The band climbed to success in a hurry in 1984, and became the 2nd biggest group in Australia (INXS was at the top of the list). The track, ""His Eyes,"" also from the first album, was used in the movie, ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning.""

Pseudo Echo had a change in membership before they released their second album. Tony Lugton was replaced with James Leigh (real name James Dingli). The groups second album was released and was also successful. It was called, ""Love An Adventure,"" and was released in 1985. From the album came the hit singles, ""Love An Adventure,"" ""Don’t Go,"" ""Try,"" and ""Living In A Dream."" The album was re-released the next year and included the remake of the song, 'Funkytown,"" (a Lipps, Inc. Song). The album reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and number 8 in the U. K., in 1987. The album also stayed at number 1 in Australia for 13 weeks. The track listing was a little different for the album released overseas than it was for the release in Australia, and the U. K.. The overseas version of the album was re-released in 1987, with a few changes with some of the songs.

The band released their third album in 1989, and it was called, ""Race."" The album was more of a pop rock and metal style and was not as successful as the first two albums were. Singles from the album were, ""Fooled Again,"" ""Over Tomorrow,"" ""Eye Of the Storm,"" and 'Don’t You Forget."" Their change in music style seemed to have lost many from their established fan base they previously had with their New Romantic style of music. The band went on tour to promote the ""Race,"" album and then split up shortly after the tour ended, in 1990.

Pseudo Echo reunited in 1999 and produced the EP called ""Funkytown Y2K: RMX."" The EP included 6 new re-mixes of ""Funkytown,"" and a year later (in 2000), they released a double CD called, ""Teleporter."" The CD consisted of 4 all new tracks, 5 re-mixed tracks, and a live performance in Melbourne, Australia. The group continued to tour in Australia and were last reported seen in 2005, touring with The Idols.

He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman.

However, the new members were keen to add new musical styles and Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned ""Black Sheep of the Family"" with ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves"" turned down by the band. He decided to record the song with [a291557] instead, using Dio's band [a312415] as additional musicians. He enjoyed the results, and a full album, billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood.

After the release of three studio albums and an extensive world tour in 1977–78, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the ""sword and sorcery"" theme. Dio did not agree with this change and left Rainbow. Together with then new vocalist [a353675], Blackmore scored a hit single with “Since You Been Gone”. 

After more lineup changes and albums, Ritchie disbanded Rainbow in early 1984 to rejoin the reunited Deep Purple.

He resurrected Rainbow once again in early 1994, just after leaving Deep Purple for good. However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [a485494] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [a298038]. 

Against all expectations, Blackmore reformed Rainbow, with an all-new line-up, in late 2015. Blackmore announced that he would play ""all rock"" concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner of 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow', his first rock shows since 1997.

290234.0,250712.0,1572351,US,Warlord (2),And The Cannons Of Destruction Have Begun...,1984,33.65,10,"['LP', 'Album']","['Rock', 'Stage & Screen']","['Heavy Metal', 'Soundtrack']","Warlord is an American heavy metal band, formed in 1980 and based in Los Angeles, CA. The brainchild of guitarist/songwriter William J (Bill) Tsamis and drummer Mark S Zonder, Warlord made the trip from their native San Jose, California to Los Angeles and proceeded in crafting their unique style, which pioneered what is called today “Epic Power Metal."" The new band caught the attention of Brian Slagel, whose label, Metal Blade Records, had recently issued Metal Massacre, a compilation featuring up-and-coming local metal acts such as Malice, Steeler, Ratt, Slayer and Metallica. 

 An aficionado of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and admirer of the Euro-metal aesthetic, influences of which are evident in Warlord's sound, Slagel was impressed by Warlord's semi-progressive style inspired by such diverse acts as Rainbow, Scorpions and Jethro Tull. Slagel decided to offer the band a spot on his next compilation and Warlord would make their vinyl debut with ""Lucifer's Hammer"" on 1982's Metal Massacre II. Earning rave reviews, Warlord made a repeat appearance with ""Mrs Victoria"" on Metal Massacre III and were signed to Metal Blade for their 1983 Deliver Us album which got the band featured in important publications such as Kerrang, Sounds, Burrn, and Music Connection. Furthermore, Warlord was receiving continual FM radio play in major US markets.

Adding further intrigue to the growing Warlord mystique was the band members' use of pseudonyms such as 'Destroyer' / 'The Raven' (Tsamis), 'Thunderchild' (Zonder), 'Damien King' (vocalist Jack Rucker), and 'Sentinel' (keyboardist Diane Kornarens) as well as Warlord's refusal to become just another LA club act, opting to present themselves on a grander scale instead. To that end, the band rented The Raymond Theater to stage what would turn out to be the only Warlord live performance in the USA until now (August 2013). It was filmed and recorded for the group's first full-length release, ""And The Cannons Of Destruction Have Begun...,"" issued in October 1984 and accompanied by a VHS home video release of the same name (now in DVD). The album featured 2 brand new tracks, ""Soliloquy"" and ""MCMLXXXIV"", as well as both cuts from the ""Lost And Lonely Days"" / ""Aliens"" 12"" single released earlier that same year. Tsamis, Zonder, and Kornarens were joined by bassist Dave Watry ('Archangel') and new vocalist Rick Cunningham ('Damien King II').  A third vocalist worked shortly afterwards with the band (even if just in studio-recording and never on a stage): Rick Anderson, also known at the time as ""Damien King III"".

The prevalence of “hair metal,"" ""rap music,"" and the inability to retain a live lineup that could be up to Tsamis' and Zonder's high standards led to the cessation of band operations in 1986. The band's label, Metal Blade, would issue ""Thy Kingdom Come"", a quasi Best-Of, in December of that year. An extended version, including the whole Deliver Us album, followed in 1989, titled ""Best of Warlord."" Unbeknownst to Tsamis and Zonder, however, the music of Warlord had already taken off in Europe, and the band amassed a cult-like following.  This was largely due to rave magazine reviews, continuous radio play, and the circulation of many demos via ""tape trading,"" as well as positive word-of-mouth promotion among metal fans.  With the onset of the internet, the music of Warlord spread worldwide and thus helped secure Warlord a place in the history of heavy metal as one of the greatest metal bands of all time for both artistic integrity as well as their unique melodic style.

Post 1986, found Tsamis recording first an acoustic demo under the name “Lordian Winds” as part of a sprawling project based on John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" (released in 2012 by NoRemorse records) and then launching an apocalyptic-themed female-fronted band called Lordian Guard. In the meantime, Zonder joined Prog Metal pioneers Fates Warning and went on to release numerous albums with them as well as other bands since (due to his universally recognized talent) his skills were -and still are- in high demand.

It was during one of Fates Warning's tours that Zonder realized that Warlord's following had grown considerably with fans approaching him to sign Warlord albums and demanding new music from the band. Zonder contacted Tsamis and, as soon as schedules permitted, Warlord was once again converted to active status. Vocalist duties were assigned to Hammerfall vocalist (and big Warlord fan) Joacim Cans.  Thus, in 2002, a new album, ""Rising Out Of The Ashes,"" was recorded and released worldwide to rave reviews.  And this was followed by the first ever Warlord live performance at the Wacken Open Air festival.

A string of mishaps and very serious family health issues plagued Warlord after these performances and Warlord was once again, put on a hiatus which lasted for almost 9 years. With these issues resolved and considerable pressure by fans and promoters alike, Warlord returned to active status formally in March 2012, with the surprise release of the first new Warlord song in 10 years.  “Night Of The Fury” was first released on Warlord's fan club (and in general) on Facebook where it was also revealed that not only was Warlord back in the studio working on a new album, but that vocalist duties would be handled by one of the original 80s Warlord vocalists, Rick Anderson (whose stint in Italian band Martiria had just ended).  Philip Bynoe (current Steve Vai) joined the band on bass and the collaboration resulted in a new 55 minute album, ""The Holy Empire,"" which quickly sold out, leading to ongoing re-pressings.  ""The Holy Empire"" was also released on all major digital platforms as well as a collector's edition limited-release cassette which sold out in under one day. A vinyl 2 LP version (with a live bonus track) of ""The Holy Empire"" will be released in October 2013 by Alone Records.

In the meantime, mounting pressure by promoters and fans bore fruit and Warlord announced that it would headline the April 2013 German ""Keep It True XVI"" Festival. This announcement was followed by two more headlining dates in Greece - Thessaloniki and Athens which sold out, thus demanding a second show in Athens which was sold out as well. 

“The Holy Empire,"" has received numerous rave reviews from the international metal press and has been featured in almost all major in-print publications as well as internet-only outlets the world over.  In April 2013 Warlord took the full page cover of the prestigious Greek Metal Hammer print magazine.

Currently Warlord is working on their fifth yet-unnamed full length studio release as well as overseeing the production of a Blu-Ray/DVD/Double CD combo shot in HD video and audio during the Athens concerts.

In September 2013, on a radio interview, Tsamis and Zonder announced that lead vocalist duties for Warlord had been assigned to Nicholas Leptos of Arrayan Path.

Three members (Mark Albrow, Alan Fish and Ron Wright) lived with Stephen Mallinder (Cabaret Voltaire) and Paul Widger (They must be Russians, Clock DVA, the Box) in a villa called Hula Kula. After trying the bass players Alan Watt, the notorious Chris Brain (Tense, NOS) and Mark Brydon (Chakk, Moloko), and after the replacement of Alan Fish by Nort (both drummed for the Cabs), Hula recorded the impressive album Murmur. Ingredients like cut ups, steady rhythms, and paranoia vocals were blended together into a unique white funky sound. 
Hula recruited John Avery as a bass player. A bass player was necessary for the exciting live shows with lots of video material (Peter Care). Hula continued to bring out danceable 12 inches and more experimental albums. With this line-up Hula was more or less successful. International tours were made. Radio sessions for VPRO and John Peel were recorded and broadcasted. Being a support act for Depeche Mode implied performing live in Wembley Arena for huge crowds.

After Nort left the band in 1986 the music changed, but still remained interesting. Later on Mark Albrow quit as well. When their record company Red Rhino went bankrupt they moved on to Wax Trax. They released the last Hula record: a Jimi Hendrix cover of Voodoo Chile. The 12 inch did not sort out the desired effect. Jo Cammack joined in officially and they made new songs in 1991. Intimates say it is the best Hula ever made. For the public it is hard to judge, for the material is still in the vaults of the studio. Eventually Hula broke up.

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

d. San Francisco, California, February 15, 1981, by drug overdose.
 Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, and was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".
Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud but clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his effect on the blues genre, on helping to influence the revived production of the guitar, and on many other guitarists.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

He is the man who introduced stream of consciousness into folk music and turned folk into classical music, and then made it cross the boundaries of Western and Eastern music. The spiritual father of the ""American primitive guitar"", Fahey turned the guitar solo into a metaphysical exercise. He set up Takoma Records in 1959 to release not only his own albums but also Leo Kottke's ""6 & 12 String Guitar"" (1971), an artist with whom he later also collaborated.

Fahey contracted the debilitating Epstein-Barr virus in 1986, which severely hampered his career for over 5 years. During this low period, he was championed by alternative artists such as Sonic Youth and Jim O'Rourke, and 'Spin' magazine included a large article on him by Byron Coley in 1994. The albums ""City of Refuge"" (Tim Kerr, 1997) and ""Womblife"" (Table Of Elements, 1997) marked his return to recording, showcasing a move into avant-garde, experimental, dissonant electric guitar music, far from his previous progressive-folk style.
 
Fahey died on February 22 2001, Salem, Oregon, USA due to complications following a heart bypass operation.

They are regarded as a catalyst of the new wave of Welsh rock in the early '80s.
The band was formed in by vocalist David R. Edwards and instrumentalist T. Wyn Davies in 1982 while they were at Ysgol Uwchradd in Aberteifi, with instrumentalist Patricia Morgan joining in 1984.Edwards' lyrics were almost entirely in the Welsh language, the subject matter reflecting his ""extreme disillusionment"" with life in Wales in the early 1980s era under Margaret Thatcher.After four cassette-only releases on Casetiau Neon, the band had their first vinyl release in 1987 on Anhrefn Records, with the Hwgr-Grawth-Og EP featuring just Edwards and Morgan, which was picked up by John Peel and led to a session being recorded for his BBC Radio 1 show (the first of five such sessions). While Welsh radio gave the band little airplay, they also found an outlet through Geraint Jarman's Fideo 9 television show on S4C. The band's first album, Wyau (Eggs), was released in 1988, and was followed two years later with Pyst (Posts) on the Ofn label. Davies left in 1990 and the group continued as a duo for a while, before being augmented by a series of musicians, notably drummer Al Edwards. Moving to Ankst Records, the Christmas-themed Blwch Tymer Tymor cassette was issued in 1991. Edwards collaborated with Tŷ Gwydr and Llwybr Llaethog on the 1992 album LL.LL v T.G. MC DRE, before releasing a final Datblygu album in 1993 with Libertino.After a single, ""Alcohol""/""Amnesia"" in 1995, the band split up.

In August 2008 a new 7"" single ""Can y Mynach Modern"" (The Song of the Modern Monk) was released. The song recounts (over its brief ninety seconds) the turmoil and madness that engulfed Edwards as the band fell apart in the mid nineties and the long road to recovery that resulted from the fallout. The track is intended as a full stop on their legacy rather than a brand new start. Datblygu have been cited as a major influence on the generation of Welsh bands that followed, including Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Super Furry Animals (who covered Datblygu's ""Y Teimlad"" on their Mwng album).
In a rare TV appearance, David featured on S4C documentary programme O Flaen dy Lygaid in 2009, presented by Cardiff-based broadcaster and friend of David's, Ali Yassine, which followed David and his battle to recover from mental illness. The programme also featured Datblygu bandmember and former Pobol y Cwm actress Ree Davies and her own battle against mental illness. In 2012 an exhibition celebrating the band's history was held in a Cardiff coffee shop. Edwards and Morgan reunited in 2012 for the EP Darluniau'r Ogof Unfed Ganrif ar Hugain. A new mini-album, Erbyn Hyn, was released in June 2014 and a new album, Porwr Trallod (Tribulation Browser), in December 2015. In 2017 David released a series of poems for the very first time in his second language English compiled in a book called ""Search In English For The House Of Tolerance"", released with an accompanying CD of the book audio read with music by Ashley Cooke on the small Welsh label Recordiau Prin.

Edwards passed away in June 2021.

10343.0,13448.0,60723,UK,Tangerine Dream,Cyclone,1978,38.45,3,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']","['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Krautrock', 'Prog Rock']","Founded by the late [a=Edgar Froese], Tangerine Dream is perhaps the premier exponent of ""electronic rock"" music of the ""Berlin School"". From their ""free-rock"" beginnings in the nascent ""krautrock"" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional ""rock"" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.

Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the ""krautrock"" twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and ""freak out jamming"" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the ""Berlin School"". Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.

After a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. [a=Paul Haslinger] replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son [a=Jerome Froese] in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own [l=TDI Music] label (later renamed [l=Eastgate]), TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate—father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories—but the group's artistic direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members."

Britain's most successful home-grown pop star, he has had more than 130 singles, albums and EP's make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist.  He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with [a27518]) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's–2000's).

He was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, ""The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook""."

A chance meeting with guitar virtuoso Hartley Cain led to the formation of a rock band. He rapidly built up a large fan base around the Midlands, London and Germany. The rock career lost momentum when the major album Rogues & Thieves did not take off but he did get on Top Of The Pops as part of his mate, Roy Wood¹s band, The Move. Gradually his music became more Country and he was invited by Mervyn Conn to be part of the famed Wembley Festivals. Mervyn Conn backed two albums recorded in Nashville with the Jordanaires and Hargus Pig Robbins. The first, Southern Fried Frog was and still is a massive seller. Froggie did and still does sing 99 percent of his own material and he has the largest following of any UK artist.
His autobiography, Raymond Who?, is a great read. UK singers cover more of his songs than any other writer. When he released Don't Let Me Cry Again, Terry Wogan played it every day for a fortnight but unfortunately a distribution blip stopped it being a major pop hit.
After fighting health problems he was still a major player on the UK Country scene having played with most of the major American artists including Tina Turner who recorded one of his songs.

[a=Kenny MacLean] later joined the group on bass and keyboards.

The band's name was taken from the 1931 film, ""Platinum Blonde"", starring Jean Harlow. The band was renowned for its trademark glam-rock appearance, with outfits in pastel colours and 80s glam-style music videos.

Platinum Blonde began as a performing the music of and in the style of [a=The Police] in bars in Ontario, Canada. The group released they’re debut EP “Platinum Blonde” also known as “Six Track Attack” in the fall of 1983. Then after the success of the EP they released ""Standing in the Dark"" in early 1984, which went double platinum and launched the group into the Canadian canon, with regular radio and video play. Often referred to as ""Canada's Duran Duran"", primarily due to their similar glam-rock image, British production and New Wave video style, the band's early lyrics hit on political themes, including police state repression (Doesn't Really Matter) and nuclear war (Standing in the Dark).

Kenny MacLean joined the band in time for their second album, 1985’s ""Alien Shores"", which went quintuple platinum.

The band's third album, 1987's ""Contact"",  went platinum and notoriously featured Canadian pop duo, [a=Tú] on backing vocals.

The band's final release, 1990's ""Yeah Yeah Yeah"" was released under the name ""The Blondes"" on [l=Justin Entertainment Inc.]. 

The band separated to work on solo projects until 1999, when Mark Holmes began touring again, with Dave Barrett and [a=Sascha Tukatsch] backing him, to promote the greatest hits album, ""Seven Year Itch: 1982-1989"".

In 2002, Mark Holmes and partners opened the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[7] The Mod Club Theatre has showcased such musicians as Muse, Amy Winehouse, MGMT, The Killers, Keane and Feist, among others.

Rumors of a reunion of the original band, and possibly some new material, continued to swirl, as the band played a few charity concerts in the mid-2000s. A DVD video compilation entitled Platinum Blonde: The Complete DVD Collection, containing all of their music videos was in production but ultimately shelved by CBS as they were bought out by Sony Music that same year.[citation needed]

In November 2008, Holmes took up McLean’s long-standing offer to make a guest appearance at one of his shows at the Mod Club, this time to mark the release of his third solo CD entitled Completely. McLean had commented to Holmes “hundreds of times” that Platinum Blonde should re-unite. Holmes quotes McLean as saying, “Let's get back together. Music doesn't have any rock stars anymore.”[citation needed] Holmes always replied that he was too busy with his DJ career, but this time he agreed and they performed a collection of Platinum Blonde hits. MacLean died of a heart attack in his recording studio on Yonge Street in Toronto, three hours after the show ended. His body was found there on November 24, 2008.[8] He was 52 years old.[9]

On March 10, 2010, Platinum Blonde played their first reunion show at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto, Ontario. The next day, the band announced on Much Music that a reunion was in the works with a new recording and show dates. The original line up of Mark Holmes, Sergio Galli, and Chris Steffler were inducted into the Radio and Television Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame.[citation needed]

In 2010, drummer Chris Steffler had to surrender his drum seat with the band after developing the auditory affliction tinnitus.[citation needed]Derrick Gyles joined together on drums until later 2011

In June 2012, Platinum Blonde members Mark Holmes and Sergio Galli, along with drummer Dan Todd and bassist Rob Laidlaw released a new single, ""Beautiful"" and announced a new album Now & Never would be released in August of that year. The video for ""Beautiful"", directed by Jesse Mann, was released in February 2013. A video for ""Valentine"", directed by Michael Penney, was released in March 2014.[citation needed]

As of 2020, the band is back to a power trio consisting of Mark Holmes (vocals and bass), Sergio Galli (guitar), and Justin ""Juice"" Kadis (drums) as they continue to tour."

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004.

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

For 51 years the band consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard and bassist and co-lead vocalist Dusty Hill, who was replaced (at his request) by the band's bass technician Elwood Francis after Hill's death on July 28, 2021. The band were formed by former [a684681] members Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell with bassist Lanier Greig, which form they recorded debut single [m329083]. Mitchell and Greig were then almost immediately replaced by former [a1057516] drummer Frank Beard and Billy Etheridge respectively, finalising their classic line-up when Dusty Hill, another former member of American Blues, replaced Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units. ZZ Top also ranks 80th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units."

Following an appearance on Channel 4 TV show ""The Tube"" performing ""Relax"", the group were signed up by [a=Trevor Horn] and [a=Paul Morley]'s new [l=ZTT] record label. With the benefit of Horn's production skills and Morley's off-the-wall marketing ideas, ""Relax"" came out in October 1983 and slowly but surely took off. It was already a top ten hit when, in January 1984, BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Read suddenly realised what the song was actually [i]about[/i], leading to a total BBC ban on the disc. From this moment on, Frankie Goes To Hollywood became not just a pop group but a phenomenon. The record went to number one in the UK, and was a smash hit across Europe and even in the USA. ""Frankie Says"" T-shirts (some dreamt up by Morley, but far more the creations of small-time bootleggers) became the fashion statement of the year, and anticipation was at such a fever pitch that every subsequent FGTH release that year - two singles and a double-LP - went straight in at number one in their home country, an unprecedented achievement and a triumph for ZTT.

Now established as huge stars in the UK and Europe (though like so many other ""British invasion"" acts they were doomed to One-hit Wonder status in the US), Frankie spent much of 1985 on tour before starting work on their second album, the [a=Stephen Lipson]-produced ""Liverpool"". Trailed by the popular single ""Rage Hard"", the album came out in October 1986 but failed to reach the sale levels of ""Welcome To The Pleasuredome"".

It was the beginning of the end for Frankie Goes To Hollywood - six months later, Johnson announced he was leaving the band for a solo contract with MCA. In the subsequent high-profile legal battle, ZTT lost their claim of contract-breaking against Johnson, a ruling which effectively brought the curtain down on the label's golden age. Rutherford quit too, leaving a diminished group who subsequently disbanded without releasing anything.

The original line-up reunited to play one song, ""Welcome To The Pleasure Dome"", during the National Lottery's Big Eurovision Welcome concert on 7th May 2023."

That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs. It was also the label's idea to release the album under the name [b]Johnny Cougar[/b] which Mellencamp did not approve of.
It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks. 
Following that was [i]Uh-huh[/i] which would be his first release under the moniker [b]John Cougar Mellencamp[/b]; the name he would stick by until he gradually dropped the ""Cougar"" and just went by his given name [b]John Mellencamp[/b].

They emerged from Southern California to gain international prominence, touring enough to become a major attraction in virtually every city where a scene existed and undoubtedly inspiring others to get in the game. Via the band's SST label, Black Flag played an essential role in the development and popularization of American punk. Through countless revolving-door personnel changes — which spawned numerous spin-off bands along the way — Black Flag persevered until 1986, finally dissolving after locating and exploring the zone where punk and heavy metal intersect and overlap.

Guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn founded Black Flag in 1976 along with vocalist Keith Morris. They were initially called Panic, adopting the Black Flag moniker a few years later. Ginn remained the only constant member in the band until their split in the summer of 1986. In 2003, Ginn resurrected the Black Flag for a couple shows to benefit cat rescue organizations. These shows featured contributions from some old members as well as new players and reactions were mixed. In January 2013, Ginn announced that he was relaunching the band with vocalist Ron Reyes (the second of 4 vocalists to pass through the group in its initial run) with the intention of extensive touring and recording new material. At the same time, Keith Morris and one-time bassist and SST Records co-founder Chuck Dukowski launched Flag, which also featured former members Bill Stevenson and Dez Cadena as well as Descendents/ALL guitarist Stephen Egerton, to perform the music of Black Flag."

Wanting a respite from the studio, MacKay formed the Explorers with Manzanera and vocalist James Wraith. The Explorers started recording a year later, debuting with the snappy synth-pop track ""Lorelei"" in June 1984. On ""Lorelei,"" Manzanera and MacKay peeled away Roxy Music's lush, dreamy arrangements but retained their original band's funky grooves. The Explorers performed for BBC Radio One in December 1984, the group's first concert. In 1985, Virgin Records released the Explorers' self-titled LP; the band also toured the U.K. However, the Explorers couldn't sell records; the group began recording a second album at Gallery Studios in October 1985, but the band's lack of success had it shelved. The Explorers split up in 1986. In 1989, Manzanera's Expression Records issued the Explorers' second LP, Manzanera & MacKay; the album was credited to Manzanera & MacKay as well and not the Explorers. After the breakup of the Explorers, Manzanera and MacKay started solo careers.

They were favored by the mod subculture and played soul music-influenced pop music.

The band was formed as [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1327667-The-Boys-12]The Boys[/url] in August 1963, in Kentish Town, North West London. After Peter Watson joined them as an additional guitarist in 1965, they changed their name to The Action. The original members were Reg King (lead vocals) (born Reginald King, 5 February 1945, Paddington, West London, died, 8 October 2010, Belvedere, Kent), Alan 'Bam' King (lead guitar, vocals) (born Alan King, 18 September 1945, Muswell Hill, North London), Mike ""Ace"" Evans (bass guitar, vocals) (born Michael Evans, 10 July 1944, Henley, Berkshire, died 15 January 2010, London) and Roger Powell (drums) (born 4 July 1945, Camden Town, North West London).

Shortly after their formation, they signed to [l=Parlophone]. ""Land of a Thousand Dances"" b/w ""In My Lonely Room"" was well received by critics but sold poorly. None of the Action's singles achieved success in the UK Singles Chart.

After disastrous experiences with the Rikki Farr management, Peter Watson (born in 1945, Kings Cross, London) left the band in 1966. They continued as a quartet but were dropped from Parlophone in 1967. In the late 1960s keyboardist Ian Whiteman (born 18 May 1945, Saffron Walden, Essex) and guitarist Martin Stone (born 11 December 1946, Wokingham, Surrey) joined the band and the Action moved toward a mid-tempo psychedelic ballad style, and then into folk rock. Reg King left the band in 1967, and Alan King took over as the main lead vocalist. In 1969, when signing to John Curd's Head Records, the band was renamed [a=Mighty Baby].

Alan King later went on to form [a=Ace (7)].

[a=Mark Burgess] had been in [a=The Clichés], while [a=Reg Smithies] & [A=Dave Fielding] were in [a=Years (3)]. Dave was in a school band called Sen. The three started without a drummer and got the attention of the legendary Radio 1 DJ [a=John Peel]. After the recruitment of drummer [a=John Lever] of [a=The Politicians (6)], their first single ""In Shreds"" on CBS, made number 42 on John Peel's Festive Fifty in 1982. They originally signed with CBS, but they disagreed with how they should sound. CBS dropped them after the one single, despite encouraging sales. They soon signed with Statik. However, Statik was distributed by Virgin, so they couldn't qualify for the independent charts and were thus overlooked by the music press.
The debut album, ""Script of the Bridge"", was recorded in Rochdale during a six-week period. The band was really pissed when they found out about the reduced version which was released by MCA in the US. They then became unhappy with Statik and tried to get away from them, but were bound by contractual obligations. After their second album, ""What Does Anything Mean? Basically"", they signed with Geffen. While signed to Geffen, the band released what was to be their last album together for fifteen years, ""Strange Times"" as the band literally fell apart, acrimoniously, with grief after the 1987 sudden death of band manager Tony Fletcher.
The year 2000 saw an end to the 'hostilities' and a reforming of the group; and a new 'unplugged' album entitled 'Strip' and other live releases followed.

John Lever passed away in 2017 and Dave left the band afterwards leaving Mark and Reg as the only two original members. The Chameleons continue to perform as of 2024.

The most prominent being the loss of songwriter and co-lead singer Eric Williams in 1986. It was during the band's move out west to the city of Angels when things got bumpy.  Williams didn't stay for the duration which saw the release of one more album, 1988's Hallelujah Anyway.  Bob Bortnick took over as main frontman and prevailed with a solid effort (and a bigger push from their record label) but things weren't as musically serendipitous as the first LP. Alas, in 1985, 12 Jealous Roses was the proverbial tree falling in the forest.  Kindered spirits like The Hoodoo Gurus, The Smithereens, R.E.M. and The Replacements were slowly gaining momentum, but overall, guitar-based pop struggled as it was being marginalized amongst the likes New Order and Depeche Mode.  Being on a fledgling record label didn't help matters, either. Relativity Records was still getting its feet wet and wasn't at full power until 1987.
The genius of 12 Jealous Roses falls basically on the strength of the songs, but is immortalized by the ephemeral rush of a band's first crack at the bigtime.  They were also headstrong enough to produce themselves. Mind you, band members Bob Bortnick and Freddy Mark Linkous would go on to bigger claims of fame; Bortnick would end up as an A&R guy for Almo Records (he signed Garbage) and Linkous would be the brains and voice behind Sparklehorse.  So, these guys were no dummies."

Nearly all of New 7th's Music is spontaneous and unedited. Its members were not professional musicians, just friends getting together for jam sessions. The music was sometimes ""New Age"", sometimes ""Tribal / Ethnic"" with emphasis on percussion (a type of performance known as ""Gamelon""), and sometimes involving avant-garde or experimental music. They also threw in a bit of rock and roll on occasion. Some recordings were accompanied by live reading of texts, or improvised spoken word. While the musicians of New 7th Music were not professionals, some of them were rather good at improvising, which is an art in itself.

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

Originally from Brighton, England, they issued a unique and controversial demo entitled “Oral Sex”, halfway between rock and heavy. And thus still considered part of the NWOBHM.

Allegedly, the band was put together by Dave Long, one of the owners of Constable Records. Writer [a678572] suggested Monica, who he knew at the time. She was a stip-o-gram and did some TV (IMDB only has her listed as a stripper in a few British mini-series) and she is also in the Iron Maiden video for “2 minutes to Midnight”. The other two girls, Bev and Dee (real name Dianne) were found through Si who owned a Sex Shop at the time and ended up being the manager. Most likely, Candy never existed. 

The drummer for [a262782], [a739161], did the drum tracks, [a741841],  guitarist of [a252586] at the time, recorded the guitars. Some guy named Keith did the bass (we don’t have his last name). Garry and Steve wrote all the songs. Lol was able to contact the company whom now has the publishing rights and it is confirmed that Steve and Garry were the songwriters. The vocals were recorded at Gas Records studio in Croydon and the backing tracks were recorded at Syndicate Mansions in Catford. The producers listed are [a332500] and Brian Bonklonk (fake studio name for Garry Bushell). 

The Kerrang interview stated that the girls had been together a year (lie). Bev did all the writing (lie). They had been in previous bands (lie). Bev was 16 at the time and dating much older men. These girls, although we do not know their true backgrounds, were most likely troubled with drugs and family issues.

Bev E. Lee – Vocals

He received a lot of early coverage in Vox magazine, who published his poetry and eventually released his debut single in 1982. Rather than perform live, Stano experimented in private, collaborating with a number of different musicians including Roger Doyle, Michael O'Shea and Daniel Figgis, creating the recordings that would form his debut LP. By the time of it's release in 1983, he had reputedly made only one solo live appearance, at the Project Arts Centre in Dublin. The debut LP ""Content To Write In I Dine Weathercraft"" was released in September 1983 on Scoff Records in Ireland, imported into the UK by Rough Trade. It was eventually given a full UK release by Magnet Records in 1985.

Subsequent releases on the German Dossier label helped raise his international profile in the mid-80s. His third LP, ""Daphne Will Be Born Again"", recorded entirely on Fairlight was a departure, and was panned by Graham Linehan in Hot Press, while his fourth ""Only"" (1989), recorded for Mother Records and more rock oriented, was considered a disappointment by some. His touring band for this LP included ex members of The Experiment. His next album ""Wreckage"" (1994) was recorded partly in collaboration with Colm O'Coisoig of My Bloody Valentine.

Fronted by Maire Ni Bhraonain AKA [a=Maire Brennan], who recreated her vocals from ""Theme From Harry's Game"" for [a=Chicane]'s hit ""Saltwater"".

'Theme From Harry's Game' was released in the winter of 1982. Radio programmers and audiences were captivated by the dense harmonies and the Gaelic words. It leapt into the Top five in the UK charts. The 'Magical Ring' album followed in 1983, and by now brothers Pol and Ciaran were writing evocative and powerful music. This was furthered on 'Legend' a soundtrack commissioned for the television series, 'Robin Of Sherwood' in 1984. During this period, the band received numerous awards including an Ivor Novello and a BAFTA for their ground-breaking work on this album.

This primed the band for one of their most mesmeric records. 'Macalla', released in 1985, featured more electronic arrangements, while Maire's voice was reaching the extremes of joy and melancholy. A chance remark to their friends in U2 resulted in Bono singing a duet with Maire on the track 'In A Lifetime'. This charted twice, in 1986 and again in 1989. The follow-up, 'Sirius' was completed in Los Angeles with some of the city's most famous musicians, as the Clannad sound took another unscripted change.

'PastPresent', released in 1989 brought the music of Clannad to an even bigger audience. Summarising their first four RCA albums it became a much-loved fixture in the UK chart eventually going Top 5. The BBC had obviously noted the huge success of the soundtrack to Robin and commissioned a project that would become the outstanding album 'Atlantic Realm'. This was followed in the same year by Clannad's first soundtrack work on an animation, 'Angel And The Soldier Boy'.

Maire, Padraig and Noel were writing more now, supplementing Ciaran's work. The latter was also honing his skills as a producer. Their 'Anam' album made the top 20 in 1990. 'Theme From Harry's Game' featured on the 1992 film Patriot Games, featuring Harrison Ford, raising the band's profile again in America. The band's music was increasingly in demand for soundtrack work, appearing on Last Of The Mohicans, (1992) and Message In A Bottle (1999)."

His first live presentation of music to film was a performance to the surreal silent film ""Un Chien Andalou"" at the Roxy Theatre in Toronto.
 
Nash The Slash was born of silent film. The name comes from a killer butler (The Tipton Slasher) encountered by Laurel and Hardy in their first film 'Do Detectives Think?' in 1927. Nash the musician has gone on to create the music scores for such recent cult films as ""Roadkill"" and ""Highway 61' - both directed by Bruce McDonald. 
Between experiments with film and music Nash The Slash became first a familiar name to music fans through his association with the pop electronic group FM. Having co-written the hit songs ""Phasors on Stun "" and ""Just Like You"" Nash established his credibility as a versatile artist. His talents have been recognized with a U-KNOW (later called CASBY) award for best instrumental artist as well as a JUNO nomination for best new male vocalist.
Nash's profile was raised on the international stage when he toured the world with the likes of Gary Numan and Iggy Pop. Other high- profile shows include opening for The Who at C.N.E. Stadium in Toronto to a crowd of 70,000 people, and opening for The Tubes at a sold-out Maple Leaf Gardens. 

He started his own independent label, [l37824] and was the first Canadian to use a drum machine on record when this was still considered illegal by laws of the Toronto Musician Association.
Nash has released numerous solo albums, the best known being 1980's ""Children of the Night"" with the hit single ""Dead Man's Curve"". Other albums include ""Decomposing"", the first record playable at any speed (reviewed in Playboy Magazine 1982) and ""American Bandages"", a collection of all-American Rock classics.
Nash has recorded new music for the silent film classics ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1919) and ""The Lost World ""(1925) and for other silent film classics including ""Nosferatu ""(1922) and the original ""Phantom of the Opera""(1925). 

In 2012 he officially retired from composing and performing.

King,Midnight Believer,1978,33.45,7,"['LP', 'Album', 'Stereo']","['Jazz', 'Rock', 'Blues']",['Blues Rock'],"American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter born September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi and died May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada. B.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.

King is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname ""The King of the Blues."" He is considered one of the ""Three Kings of the Blues Guitar"" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.

In his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname ""Beale Street Blues Boy"", later shortened to ""Blues Boy"", and finally to ""B.B."" 

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. ""Beale Street was where it all started for me"", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]""Miss Martha King""[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. 

In 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song ""The Thrill Is Gone"", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.

B.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer)."

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

After a self-financed single in 1979, the band released a second in 1980 on the Aardvark label, after which Mick Fidler (vocals, guitar, saxophone) was added. Two further singles followed in 1981, before Ashley left, with Gouldthorpe taking over on vocals and Simon Hinkler (formerly of TV Product) joining on keyboards and guitar. They received support from John Peel, for whom they recorded their first session for his BBC Radio 1 show in July 1981, recording a second early the following year. They signed to the Red Flame label in 1982, releasing a single and the Dale Griffin-produced mini-LP Oceans that year. Their track ""Into the Garden"" reached number nine in the 1982 Festive Fifty. They were often compared to Joy Division, although Gouldthorpe stated ""We never listened to Joy Division – they were never an influence"". Further lineup changes followed, with John White replacing Fidler, who was sacked for missing rehearsals, Christopher Hendrick replacing MacKenzie, and David Hinkler joining on keyboards. The band was reduced to a trio of Gouldthorpe, Wilson, and Hendrick by the time of the release of their second album, One Afternoon in a Hot Air Balloon (1983), with White leaving to form UV Pop and Simon Hinkler moving into production. Simon and David Hinkler and Garry Wilson all played in Pulp around 1983. In 1984 Hendrick left, with MacKenzie returning, and the band moved on to the Golden Dawn label, adding Murray Fenton to the lineup. A third album, The Second Coming, was released in 1984. Simon Hinkler briefly returned, with band manager Tony Perrin added on bass. A live album was released in 1985, by which time the band had split up, after Fenton had joined The Batfish Boys.

Gouldthorpe and Simon Hinkler collaborated on a further album, Flight Commander Solitude & the Snake in 1986, and Hinkler went on to join The Mission. They collaborated on a second album, A Room Full of This, in 1992, working together under the name The Flight Commander.

A compilation of demos, live tracks and interviews, Afterwards, was released in 1989 on the Pleasantly Surprised label.

Gouldthorpe moved away from music to run his own hair salon, stating in 2009 ""I lost it with music for a bit and went into dark corners"".

The band reformed in 2007 after being invited to perform at the Meltdown Festival by long-time fan Jarvis Cocker, and recorded a session for Marc Riley's BBC 6 Music show. The band stayed together, releasing the Standing Still EP in 2009. In 2010 they decided to split up again after David Hinkler decided to leave, but continued after recruiting James Bacon to replace him. A new album, Civilisation, was released in October 2011.

Their second album [m=57692] (1985) features the band's biggest hits ""Broken Wings"" and ""Kyrie"", both of which peaked at number one on US pop chart. After the release of the third album [m=128873], which was not as big of a commercial success as its predecessor, guitarist Steve Farris left the band. In 1990, the fourth studio album was recorded and completed, but the label decided not to release it; Mr. Mister disbanded shortly thereafter. After 20 years, the final album, titled [m=1193039], was released by Page's own label in 2010.

On May 16, 2023, all four members of Mr. Mister performed ""Broken Wings"" together at Page's 70th birthday party. This was their first performance together in 35 years.

[a=Kenny MacLean] later joined the group on bass and keyboards.

The band's name was taken from the 1931 film, ""Platinum Blonde"", starring Jean Harlow. The band was renowned for its trademark glam-rock appearance, with outfits in pastel colours and 80s glam-style music videos.

Platinum Blonde began as a performing the music of and in the style of [a=The Police] in bars in Ontario, Canada. The group released they’re debut EP “Platinum Blonde” also known as “Six Track Attack” in the fall of 1983. Then after the success of the EP they released ""Standing in the Dark"" in early 1984, which went double platinum and launched the group into the Canadian canon, with regular radio and video play. Often referred to as ""Canada's Duran Duran"", primarily due to their similar glam-rock image, British production and New Wave video style, the band's early lyrics hit on political themes, including police state repression (Doesn't Really Matter) and nuclear war (Standing in the Dark).

Kenny MacLean joined the band in time for their second album, 1985’s ""Alien Shores"", which went quintuple platinum.

The band's third album, 1987's ""Contact"",  went platinum and notoriously featured Canadian pop duo, [a=Tú] on backing vocals.

The band's final release, 1990's ""Yeah Yeah Yeah"" was released under the name ""The Blondes"" on [l=Justin Entertainment Inc.]. 

The band separated to work on solo projects until 1999, when Mark Holmes began touring again, with Dave Barrett and [a=Sascha Tukatsch] backing him, to promote the greatest hits album, ""Seven Year Itch: 1982-1989"".

In 2002, Mark Holmes and partners opened the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[7] The Mod Club Theatre has showcased such musicians as Muse, Amy Winehouse, MGMT, The Killers, Keane and Feist, among others.

Rumors of a reunion of the original band, and possibly some new material, continued to swirl, as the band played a few charity concerts in the mid-2000s. A DVD video compilation entitled Platinum Blonde: The Complete DVD Collection, containing all of their music videos was in production but ultimately shelved by CBS as they were bought out by Sony Music that same year.[citation needed]

In November 2008, Holmes took up McLean’s long-standing offer to make a guest appearance at one of his shows at the Mod Club, this time to mark the release of his third solo CD entitled Completely. McLean had commented to Holmes “hundreds of times” that Platinum Blonde should re-unite. Holmes quotes McLean as saying, “Let's get back together. Music doesn't have any rock stars anymore.”[citation needed] Holmes always replied that he was too busy with his DJ career, but this time he agreed and they performed a collection of Platinum Blonde hits. MacLean died of a heart attack in his recording studio on Yonge Street in Toronto, three hours after the show ended. His body was found there on November 24, 2008.[8] He was 52 years old.[9]

On March 10, 2010, Platinum Blonde played their first reunion show at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto, Ontario. The next day, the band announced on Much Music that a reunion was in the works with a new recording and show dates. The original line up of Mark Holmes, Sergio Galli, and Chris Steffler were inducted into the Radio and Television Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame.[citation needed]

In 2010, drummer Chris Steffler had to surrender his drum seat with the band after developing the auditory affliction tinnitus.[citation needed]Derrick Gyles joined together on drums until later 2011

In June 2012, Platinum Blonde members Mark Holmes and Sergio Galli, along with drummer Dan Todd and bassist Rob Laidlaw released a new single, ""Beautiful"" and announced a new album Now & Never would be released in August of that year. The video for ""Beautiful"", directed by Jesse Mann, was released in February 2013. A video for ""Valentine"", directed by Michael Penney, was released in March 2014.[citation needed]

As of 2020, the band is back to a power trio consisting of Mark Holmes (vocals and bass), Sergio Galli (guitar), and Justin ""Juice"" Kadis (drums) as they continue to tour."

The band was started in 1983 by Mat Fox with the slogan ""making politics swing"". Inspired by Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra, it swiftly became a large, loose and freewheeling ensemble. Despite the instrumental line-up (saxes and brass, plus vibes and accordion - up to 24 musicians at its largest - ), it was never a jazz big band as such. But it drew on that tradition - occasionally satrically, always humourously. In its more organised moments it could echo Basie or Ellington's classic hard-swinging punch, in its more disorganised ones Sun Ra's high-energy and joyful cacophony.

Source material was drawn from the political left: the songs of Bertolt Brecht (with both Kurt Weill and Hans Eisler), Maoist anthems, Chartist protest songs, Cuban rhumbas, miners' anthems, South African township jazz, Irish jigs. The essence of The Happy End was in delivering this music with humour and energy rather than dourness or overt preaching. Many early gigs were part of the mid-eighties anti-Thatcher movements, the Miners' Strike and the GLC (Greater London Council) included; the band was also involved in the burgeoning alternative comedy circuit, especially at Roland Muldoon's Hackney Empire. At its best, a Happy End gig was a genuinely celebratory experience.

In a spirit of musical collectivism, the band contained less-experienced players alongside more polished ones, and combined skilful arrangements with organised chaos so that both could thrive. The musicians were also evenly balanced between men and women. (Belonging to a big band that wasn't for once all-male should have made life on the road more civilized, but often didn't.)

The original vocalist was Sarah Jane Morris, a singer with an extraordinary contralto range who left the band in 1988 to work with The Communards. Since then she has developed a successful solo career in the jazz/soul area. The Happy End was lucky enough to find another singer with a wonderfully powerful and expressive voice, Bernadette Keeffe, who was with the band for its last eight years."

David received a full scholarship to study at the famous Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland.  It was there that he fully surrendered his life to Christ.

They released a self-funded 7"" of [m=304539] mere weeks after [a=David Bowie] had released his original. This scam got them a publishing deal with Bowie's publishers and a proper record deal.  

By 1980 they were touring with [a=The Cure] and signed to [l=Fiction Records], for whom they recorded [m=72502]. At the turn of the year they relocated to [l=Situation Two] and put out a string of singles, later compiled on the album [m=72538], recorded using money from major labels who were expecting demos to be produced with their cash. In tandem with their increasing consumption of cocaine and speed, the group's music became increasingly deranged and experimental. [a=John Murphy] and [a284809] (ex-The Cure) became official members. 

The Associates signed with WEA in 1982. [a=Martha Ladly] joined as back-up singer. Billy and Alan immediately scored a string of UK top 20 chart hits. The album [m=72576] made the UK top 10, winning album of the year awards in the UK music press. The group’s drug use was at a peak - Billy and Alan’s behaviour was becoming somewhat erratic. On the eve of their biggest ever UK tour MacKenzie pulled out. A US deal with Island was consequentially lost. Deciding that he couldn't continue, Alan Rankine left the group. From this moment on, the Associates were to be just that: Billy MacKenzie solo, with different associates for each release.

MacKenzie started recording a follow-up album. 1984s [m=72626] cost WEA £250,000. It took three years and four production teams to record - twice (dissatisfied with the original production Billy ""lost"" the first versions' master tapes, forcing a re-recording). The album had some chart success, but WEA were dissatisfied, and started pressuring MacKenzie to follow a more straightforward pop-soul direction. Frustrated by WEA's lack of support, MacKenzie focussed on collaborations, most notably with [a=Yello] (featuring on One Second, Flag, Baby and writing The Rhythm Divine). 

1988's comeback single, a cover of Blondie's [m=72630], failed to chart. WEA refused to release its parent album, The Glamour Chase, and with MacKenzie over a million pounds in debt to the label The Associates were dropped. 

Circa quickly signed MacKenzie and in 1990 released Wild And Lonely, the last album of original music under the The Associates name. 1992's album, the [a=Thomas Fehlmann] / [a=Boris Blank]-produced Outernational was issued under the artist name [a=Billy MacKenzie]. Even though the album had good reviews in the press and Baby was single of the week in Melody Maker, the album stiffed - partially due to Circa winding down operations. 

Aside from an aborted Associates reunion with Alan Rankine in the mid-90s, MacKenzie remained a solo artist, collaborating in the 90s with [a=Peach], [a=Barry Adamson], [a=Paul Haig] and [a=Apollo Four Forty] amongst others. At the end of 1996, after four years without a deal, he signed with Nude Records.

Tragically his first release for the label was a posthumous one. The death of his mother in 1996 was likely the trigger of an emotional breakdown that led him deeper and deeper into a depressed state. Billy MacKenzie died aged 39, on 22nd January 1997 from an overdose of prescribed and over-the-counter pills.

Alan Rankine passed away from natural causes at the age of 64 on the 2nd of January 2023.

The band recorded their first album Playing in the City in 1981 at Chapel Lane Studios just outside Hereford. The band were one of the first fully professional Christian rock (CR) bands in the United Kingdom, all members having worked as professional musicians in mainstream rock and pop.

The band signed to the fledgling Chapel Lane label that had just been started by Rob Andrews, owner of Chapel Lane Studios. This was a bold attempt to produce CR recordings that matched professional secular standards and also raise Christian rock's profile.

The band toured the album extensively throughout the UK, Europe and Scandinavia on major tours supporting Larry Norman. Barratt Band was featured on Larry Norman's 1981 live Friends on Tour album, along with Alwyn Wall. In their own right they embarked on smaller club tours, the highlight being the 1982 Greenbelt Festival held at Knebworth, where they headlined the closing night.

Larry Tomaso replaced Tim Hatwell on bass in 1982 and the band appeared on numerous tours and albums supporting or backing some of the top CR artists of the day from the USA and UK, including Larry Norman, Steve Camp, Phil Keaggy, Jesse Dixon and Sheila Walsh.

The band released a second album in 1984 named Voice with Dave Engel on drums.

The heavy touring and work schedules took their toll resulting in one of the band members collapsing through exhaustion while on tour in Scandinavia towards the end of 1986.

Although the band has never officially split up, it never toured or recorded again."

That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs. It was also the label's idea to release the album under the name [b]Johnny Cougar[/b] which Mellencamp did not approve of.
It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks.

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.  

All the members contributed to the songwriting but lyrics were often provided by people outside of the group, including Sandy Pearlman, rock scribe [A=Richard Meltzer], poets [a=Patti Smith] (Lanier's longtime companion) and [a=Jim Carroll], and science fiction author [a=Michael Moorcock], amongst others.  Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"". The Bouchard brothers also contributed lead vocals.  

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.  Lanier returned in 1987 and the band continued to tour, although they recorded very little.  2001's ""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"" was the band's last studio recording until 2020's ""The Symbol Remains.""  Roeser and Bloom continue to tour with new members (Lanier retired from the band in 2006 and passed away in 2013) .

The group, which lasted from 1977 to 1982, existed in two incarnations, both fronted by Adam Ant. The first, founded in May 1977, achieved considerable cult popularity during the transition from the punk rock era to the post-punk and new wave era and were noted for their high camp and overtly sexualised stage performances and songs. The final lineup of this first incarnation – Dave Barbarossa, Matthew Ashman and Leigh Gorman – left the band in January 1980 at the suggestion of then-de facto manager [a24495], to form the instrumentalist personnel of the controversial [a10381].

The second incarnation of Adam and the Ants featured guitarist Marco Pirroni and drummer-producer Chris Hughes and was noted for its use of Burundi style drumming. It lasted from February 1980 to March 1982 and achieved major commercial success in the UK and abroad.

Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist [a=Peter Gabriel], who left the band August 15, 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer [a=Phil Collins] who assumed lead vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist [a=Steve Hackett], two years later, saw the remaining three members (Phil Collins, keyboardist [a=Tony Banks] and bassist/guitarist [a=Mike Rutherford]) move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

Latimer, the last original member, revived the Camel name in 1991. With various lineups four more studio albums were recorded by 2002. The band played a farewell tour in 2003. It was later disclosed that Latimer was ill and underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in 2007.

The group formed in 1976 in Queens, New York with vocalist/keyboardist Peter Zaremba, guitarist Keith Streng, bassist Jan Marek Pakulski, and drummer Bill Milhizer and aimed to return rock & roll to the simplicity and unself-consciousness of the '50s and early '60s. (The group was often joined on-stage and in the studio by sax player [a=Gordon Spaeth], who passed on in 2005.) The group fit nicely into New York's punk and new wave scene, and an early single, ""American Beat,"" attracted the attention of independent label Red Star and, in time, I.R.S. The group's debut EP, Up-Front, was released in 1980 and was followed by their first full-length album, Roman Gods, and Blast Off!, an unreleased studio album recorded for Red Star in 1978. 1983 produced Hexbreaker, widely regarded as the Fleshtones' finest album. The band continued to record through the '80s and released Powerstance in 1992 and Beautiful Light in 1994. (Powerstance also marked the debut of new Fleshtones bassist Ken Fox, who replaced Pakulski in the lineup and has been with the group ever since.) While the group's popularity dipped under the radar in the last half of the '90s, in 2003 the group bounded back when they were signed to the potent indie label Yep Roc Records and released one of their best albums, Do You Swing? An equally solid follow-up, Beachhead, was issued in 2005 and was produced in part by Detroit garage rock kingpin [a=Jim Diamond (2)].

Paul Simmons joined from another local band. Various singers came and went. Dave Fane eventually made the job his.

We were all friends with the same ideals, so we formed the band as a way of keeping off the streets. A bit of a laugh to start with, Neil wrote most of the words, and Neil and Dave Fane worked the riffs out.

Most of our words came from Maggie Thatcher's Britain. High unemployment, race riots, getting picked on by soul boys and greasers, and learning to FIGHT BACK against everyone and everything.

We sent a demo tape off to No Future records. It contained three tracks: ""Leslie Whittle"", ""Good Ole' England"", and ""Fight Back"". They chose the latter for ""A Country Fit for Heroes, Vol. 1"". Garry Bushell, one of the founders of oi, reviewed it for Sounds music paper and said that it sounded like it was recorded in a phone box. We actually done it at Rocksnake studios in Rushden.

We graduated from playing youth clubs and mates garages to pubs and clubs, building up a following in Norhamptonshire with skins and punx. Most gigs ended in chaos and violence.

The early gigs were very local, as we were too young to drive. A local band helped out, the Zippps - very good local lads, and they had a transit van which helped.

A second demo tape was made again at Rocksnake containing: ""4 Wall Life"", ""Too Many Chiefs"", and ""Boot Boys"". Alas, Cherry Red records, who had bought No Future out (and our contract), were not big on street punk, so no other Hostile Youth trax were released.

""Fight Back"" did make it onto a Finnish (Finland) only release: a compilation of the best of No Future.

Band members: Neil Bowers (guitar), Martin Morris (bass), Paul Simmons (drums), Dave Fane (vocals).

Songs: ""Fight Back"", ""Boot Boys"", ""Southall's Burning"", ""4 Wall Life"", ""Too Many Chiefs"", ""Leslie Whittle"", ""Love and Hate"", ""Bleeding and Brawling"".

Covers included: ""Borstal Breakout"" (Sham), ""Crashed Out"" (Exploited), ""These Boots Were Made for Stomping"" (a take on Nancy Sinatra's classic) - a short detailed account of a slice of life.

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould.

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed.

Carl's leadership role in the band diminished somewhat in the late 1970's, both due to Brian's brief re-emergence as the band's producer and Carl's own substance abuse problems. He nonetheless remained a prominent and recognizable voice in the band, taking lead vocals on many songs and serving as ""mixdown producer"" on the Brian-produced ""Love You"" album. By the time of recording of 1979's ""L.A. (Light Album)"", Carl again found himself filling the vocal and songwriting gap left by a retreating Brian Wilson.

As a lead vocalist Carl was the last member of the group to be assigned lead vocals to sing.  His first turn at the solo mic was on 1964's ""Pom-Pom Playgirl"", from ""Shut Down Vol. 2"".  Over the years he has been considered one of the greatest singers in pop/rock, deftly handling ballads such as ""God Only Knows"", pop gems like ""I Can Hear Music"", and rock and rollers including ""Darlin'"" and ""Keeping The Summer Alive"".  On tour, particularly in the late 1960's and 1970's, his extraordinary voice often replaced that of his brother Brian's on songs originally sung by the latter, including ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""Surfer Girl"", and ""Let The Wind Blow"".

Carl was not the most controversial member of the band.  To his credit, his quiet, private life endured only two ripples: first, in the late 1960's, he emerged victorious from a fight with the US government over his Conscientious Objector status regarding the Vietnam draft (he and the band agreed to play a number of free benefit concerts in lieu of Carl being drafted); second, in the late 1970's he appeared on a television simulcast concert in Australia with The Beach Boys while inebriated (he later explained it away as a reaction to flu medicine).  

By the early 1980's The Beach Boys were in disarray. Frustrated with the band's sluggishness to record new material and reluctance to rehearse for live shows, Carl Wilson took a leave of absence in 1981, rather than remain as part of what he saw increasingly becoming a nostalgia act. Thence, he released a 1981 solo album, ""Carl Wilson"", to little critical notice, with songs co-written with [a360015] - particularly the extraordinary ""Heaven"" and the radio hit ""Hurry Love"". He recorded a second solo album, 1983's ""Youngblood"", in a similar vein, but by the time it was released he had already rejoined The Beach Boys. Although ""Youngblood"" did not chart, a single, the [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/987261-John-Joseph-Hall]John Hall[/url] and [a604946] penned ""What You Do To Me,"" did, and it took on new meaning after the death of brother Dennis in December 1983. Youngblood also featured a cover of [a260458]'s ""Rockin' All Over The World"", which he performed on tour with The Beach Boys in the 1980's.

During his brother Brian's mental health struggles and in-and-out participation in the band in the 1980's, particularly after the death of brother Dennis, Carl was closely involved in the legal and moral support of Brian, and was a key player in supporting Brian's second wife Melinda in the ousting of controversial psychologist [a1057138] from Brian's affairs.

Carl was diagnosed with brain and lung cancer in early 1997. Despite his illness and chemotherapy treatments, he continued to perform after diagnosis. Carl played through The Beach Boys' entire summer tour ending in the fall of 1997. Carl Wilson lost his battle with cancer on February 6, 1998, just two months after the death of his mother, Audree. He was survived by his brother Brian, wife Gina (daughter of [a10533]) and two sons [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/5454595-Justyn-Wilson]Justyn[/url] and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/6438151-Jonah-Wilson]Jonah[/url] from his first marriage to Annie Hinsche (sister of [a299166] member, [a311944], who was a mainstay of the Beach Boys' support band on tour).

A handful of additional recordings of Wilson have been released as the album ""Like a Brother"", by ""supergroup"" [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/274822-Gerry-Beckley]Beckley[/url]-[url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/529946-Robert-Lamm]Lamm[/url]-Wilson, comprising Carl Wilson, Gerry Beckley of [a249829] and Robert Lamm of [a114483].

Adi Newton formed the first lineup of Clock DVA in 1978, after his departure from The Future (the other members of which would go on to form The Human League and Heaven 17) with Judd Turner (bass), David J. Hammond (guitar), Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophone, clarinet).
The term 'DVA,' [meaning 'two' in Russian] was inspired by Anthony Burgess' satirical science fiction novel, 'A Clockwork Orange.').
Originally focusing on experimental music inspired by science fiction and the occult (with the latter fading as time went on) and later reflecting the burgeoning industrial and electronic body music that had begun seeping into underground music scenes on both sides of the Atlantic.
After a handful of privately produced cassettes (most of which have since been collected in the 'Horology' boxed sets of lps from the German label Vinyl-On-Demand) the band released a cassette on Throbbing Gristle's Industrial Records label.
""White Souls In Black Suits"" features founder members Adi Newton (vocals, violin, EMS Synthi E, tapes), Steven James ""Judd"" Turner (bass, vocals, treatments, rhythm machine, ex-Block Opposite), and the original guitarist David J. Hammond (guitar, treatments). Two additional musicians were added to the line up, Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophones, flute, and percussion,) and featured a sound much more in line with their contemporaries outside of the Sheffield scene (which had gravited to a smoother more pop oriented sound, for the most part.) The first formalised DVA line up also featured Simon Mark Elliot-Kemp on synthesiser.

In 1981, David J Hammond left and guitarist Paul Widger joined in 1980. The following album, ""Thirst,"" was produced by Psychic TV producer Ken Thomas and released through the independent record label Fetish (and was cited, by the NME Journalist Paul Morley, as one of the great albums of the 80's alongside Joy Division's ""Unknown Pleasures"" and The Fall's ""Dragnet"".)  After ""Thirst"", Newton & Turner decided to take Clock DVA into another direction and parted company with Qual, Collins and Widger, who consequently formed the short lived group The Box. Tragedy struck later with the death of co-founder Steven James Turner. By 1983, with Newton as the only remaining original member, replacements had been found in John Valentine Carruthers (guitar), Paul Browse (saxophone), Dean Dennis (bass) and Nick Sanderson (drums). A brace of singles then preceded ""Advantage"", their first album for Polydor Records. The following year Carruthers and Sanderson departed, leaving Clock DVA to continue as a trio. Although it would be five years before another Clock DVA album, Newton remained busy with his audio visual conceptual project [a=The Anti Group] (TAGC) which researched and developed ambisonics and psychoacoustics through experimental uses of frequencies and ambient acousmatic sound pieces, alongside visual and conceptual text pieces.
The album, ""The Delivery"" (a soundtrack album for a TAGC 16 mm film,) a series of recordings including ""Documents"" and the acclaimed ambisonic album ""Digitaria"" and the pioneering ""Meontological Research Recordings"" were released, as well as the soundtrack to ""Burning Water"", a 25 min TAGC film.
In 1988 ""Buried Dreams"" was recorded utilising the first digital sampling synthesisers and computer sequencing which Newton had been experimenting with in TAGC, released in 1989 by Interfisch, and often hailed as the group's masterpiece. By the time of 1991's ""Transitional Voices"", Browse had been replaced by Robert E. Baker, of TAGC. The departure of Dennis after the completion of ""Man Amplified"" and ""Digital Soundtracks"" in 1992 left the remaining duo of Newton and Baker to record ""Sign"", released on the Italian Record Label Contempo.

After 15 years of silence, Adi Newton reactivated Clock DVA.  Since 2011 the new line-up (feat. Maurizio ""TeZ"" Martinucci) has performed at major independent electronic festivals and venues throughout Europe. The 'Horology' series of vinyl box sets compiling early cassette-only material began in 2012 (with three volumes released as of 2019) and Mute Records have signed a contract with Newton to reissue all of the official Clock DVA recordings (minus private press cassette releases) along with a new studio album.
A ""new"" album, ""Post-Sign"" was released in 2013, having been recorded in 1994/95 by Newton as an instrumental companion album to ""Sign"", which had remained unreleased due to problems with an Italian record label after Contempo's demise.
""Clock 2"", a printed aluminium USB Smart Media Card in printed metal box was released with all new material plus remixes by ATOM, Scanner, Frank Bretschneider and also features several videos by [a3925208] and a 48-page PDF, was release in 2014, as well as a limited silkscreened double sleeve 45rpm 12"" of ""The Konstructor/De Konstructor"" with two DVA remixes, both through Newton's own label Anterior Research Media Communications _ armcomm.co.uk.

Passed away  August 6 2009 .Though starting out in San Francisco playing gay leatherbars as ""Billy de Sade and the Marquis"" (Billy being Billy Borsey, Willy DeVille's original name), the band changed its name To Mink DeVille (and Borsey became Willy DeVille) in 1975 and became one of the housebands in the famous NY club CBGB. CBGB was the epicenter of NY punk - and other house bands such as [a=Blondie], [a=Television] and [a=Talking Heads] got Mink DeVille categorized as part of the punk/new Wave underground to which they never belonged musically. Mink DeVille's music was built on R&B, blues and 60's classic pop blended with streetwise attitudes and back alley romanticism, not unlike the sound heard in early [a=Bruce Springsteen] songs like ""Rosalita"" and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" and heard from Springsteen confreres [a=Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes] and [a=Gary U.S. Bonds], with a twist of hispano, New Orleans and Zydeco. Discovered by [l=Capitol Records] in 1977 the band recorded three albums for the label. The fresh approach to R&B classicism and rock & roll got producer legend [a=Jack Nitzsche] interested in producing the band and he is credited as being a major influence on the development of the band's sound. Hearing the band live in its early days also caught song writing legend [a=Doc Pomus]'s attention, and he offered to write with Willy DeVille. In spite of critical acclaim and praise of DeVille's writing talent, Mink DeVille didn't make it big in the US, but caught quite an audience in Europe. 

The original Mink Deville band was broken up by Willy DeVille after the first two albums, and from 1980's ""Le Chat Bleu"" recorded in Paris, he would hand-pick musicians for recording and touring under the band name. The album is often cited as the band's best out of the six studio albums.

From 1986 Willy DeVille performed under his own name.

Key band songs include ""Spanish Stroll"", ""Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl"", ""A"" Train Lady, ""I Broke That Promise"", ""Just To Walk That Little Girl Home"" and ""Love & Emotion""

Founded in the beginning of the 1980's as pure rockabilly band

Long before terms like Psychobilly and Neorockabilly became common , The Deltas had already started spreading their own brand of high-energy Rock`n´Roll. The original lineup was Steve Bongo (vocals, drums), Captain Pat Marvel (guitar) and Little John (bass) and the trio recorded a demo tape in 1980, loaded with 50´s Rockabilly obscurities like Who Told You?, My Babe or Your Wildcat Ways. A year later they'd already got quite a reputation to be one of the wildest live acts and most talented rocking bands out there. Roy Williams, who had just started his own record company, contracted the Deltas and recorded the now classic Boogie Disease album with them in the Pathway Studios. He introduced them on the back sleeve of the longplayer as ""-wilder than the Polecats-crazier than The Meteors"". The album sold well and The Deltas became very busy touring the UK and the rest of Europe, playing small clubs as well as some of the big RnR weekenders. 

Some years later, the lineup was enlarged to a five-piece outfit with well-known ex-Polecat Boz Boorer (g) & John Buck (d) and the band released their more weirder, more diverse second album, Mad For It (1986), on ID Records, followed by another studio output Tuffer Than Tuff (1988) , a four track EP entitled You Can´t Judge A Book(1988) and a live album on the Link Records Live and Rockin´ (1989) series. 

Their unique blend of high-power Rockabilly, Blues and pure Rock`n´Roll energy still attracts both Psychobilly and Rockabilly followings all over the world and the band has also been included on many essential Psychobilly compilation albums, such as The Magnificent Seven and Hell's Bent On Rockin´ .

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

Hess' aggregation was intended by Hess to be a ""supergroup"" of sorts gathering members of [a=Weatherford Quartet], the [a=Oak Ridge Boys] and [a=The Speer Family]. The Imperials have had a rotating roster and sound over the years beginning to slowly morph into CCM beginning with [m502239]. 

The group established a relationship with [a=Elvis Presley] in 1966 as studio singers. In 1968, they became backing vocalists for [a=Jimmy Dean]  and did the same for Presley the following year working for both concurrently for a time. The band ended the deal with Presley first after 1971. They set a first for Christian music when they integrated the group by adding [a=Sherman Andrus] in February of 1972. That same year, they stopped backing Dean and from that point focused exclusively on work in the gospel music industry. They would go on to win four Grammys and 15 Dove Awards over their long career. 

The previously all-male group added its first female in 1991 when Armond's sister [a=Pam Morales] took the place of the departing [a=Jason Beddoe] during the recording of [r3884326]. She would remain with the band through 1993. 1998 saw the five original members (Hess, Morales, Nielsen, McSpadden and Slaughter) onhand to accept their Hall of Fame induction alongside later members Blackwood, Andrus, Moscheo, Murray, and Taff.



In September 2004, Armond Morales transferred ownership of the name ""The Imperials"" to the lineup at the time: son Jason Morales, Jeremie Hudson, Ian Owens and Shannon Smith. This version of the group released two albums on Lamon Records, [r12388713] and [r12388798], consisting of re-recordings of older Imperials tunes. That incarnation of the band split up in early 2010.

Currently two touring aggregations use the Imperials name:""The Classic Imperials"" comprising early 80s lead vocalist [a=Paul Smith (22)], [a=Rick Evans],[a=Lonnie Ott] and Michael Schlee which performs mostly in church venues and ""Terry Blackwood and the Imperials"", a trio comprising [a=Terry Blackwood], [a=Darrell Toney] and Lynn Royce Taylor which focuses mainly on events highlighting the Presley connection to the group.

Originally known as [i]The Climax Chicago Blues Band[/i], the Climax Blues Band has always focused on its roots, a unique combination of jazz and blues. The band has released 21 albums and had a Top 10 hit in the UK with Couldn't Get It Right. That song and I Love You were also hits in the United States ; Couldn't Get It Right reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977, and ""I Love You"" peaked at No. 12 in 1981

In 1985, Cooper and Glover recruited guitarist Lester Hunt, drummer Roy Adams, and original member Derek Holt to record the Climax Blues Band album Drastic Steps, and this line-up toured in support of the album in the UK, Europe and America. The new line-up soon became established with Cooper, Glover, Hunt, Adams and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s, releasing the live album Blues From The Attic in 1993 and Big Blues in 2004.

Cooper died of cancer, aged 69, in July 2008. He is survived by his wife and two children. He wanted the band to continue, as the other musicians had all been long serving (Glover since 1980, Adams and Hunt since 1985, and Simpson since 1991). Cooper was replaced by singer and saxophone and harmonica player Johnny Pugh, who retired in 2012, and was replaced in turn by vocalist Graham Dee and saxophone player Chris Aldridge. 

In 2019, Climax Blues Band released Hands Of Time, a new album of original bluesy funk, soul and jazz rock material that has received rave reviews.

The band emerged from a surrealist musical theatre troupe, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, that Elfman had led since 1976 and written material for in the years previous. Oingo Boingo were known for their high energy live concerts and experimental music, which can be described as mixing rock, ska, pop, and world music. The band's body of work spanned 17 years, with various genre and line-up changes.

As a rock band, Oingo Boingo started as a ska and punk-influenced new wave octet, achieving significant popularity in Southern California. During the mid-1980s, the band changed line-ups, and adopted a more pop-oriented style, until a significant genre change to alternative rock in 1994. At that point, the name was shortened to simply ""Boingo"" and the horn section was dropped. The band retired after a farewell tour in 1995, for which they reverted to the name Oingo Boingo and readopted the horn section.

The group was active from 1978 through 1988, and had a new wave/art rock sensibility that was strongly influenced by minimalism.

Tirez Tirez was founded by Missouri native Mikel Rouse, and gave its first performance as the opening act for the rock band Talking Heads at a 1978 concert in Kansas City, Missouri. The band's initial line-up was Rouse (vocals/guitar), Rob Shepperson (drums) and Jeff Burk (bass).  Tirez Tirez issued two very rare self-released LPs in their earliest days: No Double Bagging Necessary (1978) and Rush & Dissonance (1979). All three members of the group subsequently moved to New York City in 1979, and self-released their debut single (""Scattered""/""Scenery"") in November of that year.  The band's third album (1980's Etudes) was recorded in New York City, but it did not initially see a US release, and was at first only picked up for distribution by the tiny British independent label Object Music. The LP went on to sell a very respectable 2,000 copies in the UK, and US indie Aura Records later issued in the album in the US in late 1981. Aura also issued ""Razorblades"", a single taken from the album.

Bassist Burk left Tirez Tirez in 1982, and was replaced by James Bergman. Philip Johnston (keyboards/woodwinds) was also added to the group at about the same time. This line-up (Rouse/Shepperson/Bergman/Johnston) recorded 1983's Story Of The Year, which was released only in Europe via Belgian label Les Disques Du Crépuscule.  Although he had left Tirez Tirez, original band member Burk would continue to contribute finished artwork to future Tirez Tirez album and single releases after his 1982 departure; the same would be true of original drummer Shepperson after his departure in early 1984.

In 1984, Rouse would begin recording more minimalist work with his instrumental ""chamber orchestra"" [a=Mikel Rouse Broken Consort]. From this point forward, Tirez Tirez and Broken Consort often featured identical memberships, although each group had a distinctly different repertoire. For the first album credited to ""Mikel Rouse Broken Consort"" (1984's Jade Tiger) the band line up of Rouse/Shepperson/Bergman/Johnston was exactly the same as that of Tirez Tirez's Story Of The Year.  In 1984, Tirez Tirez released the Europe-only non-LP 12"" single ""Under The Door"" / ""Sleep"". The only credited musicians on this release were Rouse (guitars/keyboards/synthesizers/percussion/vocals) and, on the A-side only, Blaine L. Reininger (violin/bass programming). In 1985, bassist Bergman re-joined the fold in time for the Broken Consort LP A Walk In The Woods. The same year, the Rouse/Bergman duo (augmented by saxophonist Ellery Eskelin) also recorded the Broken Consort album A Lincoln Portrait, although it was not released until 1988.

In 1986, Tirez Tirez (now officially a duo of Rouse and Bergman) issued the non-LP 12"" ""Set The Timer"" / ""Uptight"" on Sire Records. This was their first US release in five years, and their first release to receive major label distribution.  Shortly after the release of ""Set The Timer"", the group found a permanent US home with the IRS label. For their fifth album (1987's Social Responsibility), the band was still a duo of Rouse and Bergman, with Rouse performing all instruments except bass.  The band expanded to a quintet for a subsequent tour, and for their final studio release, 1988's Against All Flags, Tirez Tirez's line-up consisted of Rouse (vocals/guitar), Bergman (bass), and new members Bill Tesar (drums), Rave Tesar (keyboards) and Mark Lampariello (guitar).  According to Mikel Rouse's web site, one further Tirez Tirez album was recorded after 1988, but it was never released. Rouse slowly phased out Tirez Tirez over the next few years, while continuing to work with many of the same musicians; in addition to Rouse, the 1993 line-up of his Broken Consort ensemble consisted of Tirez Tirez players James Bergman (bass), Bill Tesar (drums), and Mark Lampariello (guitar), along with non-Tirez member Dale Kleps (woodwinds). Tirez Tirez was still listed as a going concern in the liner notes to the 1993 Broken Consort release Soul Menu, but both groups wound down shortly thereafter."

At the age of 19, while a member of the U.S. Coast Guard, he was diagnosed with diabetes, but after completing his military duties he nevertheless pursued a career in rock & roll. 

In 1974, Brown teamed with lead guitarists David Hlubek and Steve Holland to form Molly Hatchet, so named in honor of the 17th century prostitute chopping off her clients' heads. 
After adding guitarist Duane Roland, bassist Banner Thomas, and drummer Bruce Crump and honing its Dixie-fried hard rock on the Southeast club circuit, Molly Hatchet issued its self-titled debut LP in the fall of 1978, selling a million copies. 

The follow-up, Flirtin' with Disaster, moved twice as many units, but as the band's commitments increased, Brown's struggle with diabetes grew more difficult, and exhaustion forced him to resign in 1980. 

He resurfaced in 1981 with a solo project, Danny Joe Brown and the Danny Joe Brown Band, before rejoining Molly Hatchet a year later for the tepidly received No Guts...No Glory. 

The group went on hiatus in 1985 but returned four years later with Lightning Strikes Twice. 
The record fared poorly, and Molly Hatchet soon dissolved for good, although a latter-day version of the group with none of its original lineup still intact played the club circuit well into the following century. 

Brown retired from music for good after suffering a massive stroke in 1998. He died of renal failure at his home in Davie, FL, on March 10, 2005."

Despite the failure of the third album in 1981, and being dropped by their label, they continued to release through Paul Walden's label ([l152816]), but feeling that the impetus had been lost, they decided to move on to pastures new in 1983.

Originally known as the Lepers, the band made their name in the burgeoning punk scene where they would get together exclusively to play at parties, until they were picked up by 4AD. Richard Brown (Drums) and Stephen Walker (Keyboards) were subsequently added to the line-up of the band. A debut single, ""Drowning Man"" was released in 1980 on the Limp Records label. The band's debut full-length; ""Mesh & Lace"", released by 4AD a year later, it drew heavily on the gloomy post-punk sound already patented by bands such as Joy Division. The follow-up ""After The Snow"" showed a huge progression, as they introduced warmth and strong guitar harmonies (most notably on the minor classic ""I Melt With You""), rejecting the tinny bleakness of the debut. It was especially well received in the USA, and the band relocated to New York to consolidate a popularity encouraged by college radio. 1984's ""Ricochet Days"" had a crisper production but less creative experimentation. By the time of ""Stop Start"" (1986), the band had left 4AD and Walker and Brown had quit the band and Aaron Davidson (Keyboards, Guitar) had joined. Grey initially returned to England to form a new outfit, but reconvened Modern English in 1990 with Davidson and Conroy and released ""Pillow Lips"" on the TVT label in 1990. Robbie Grey with new band members Ted Mason (guitars) and Matthew Shipley (keyboards) co wrote and produced a second release for TVT though it received very little enthusiasm from the label. In 1995, the new Modern English line up recorded and released ""Everything's Mad"" on the Imago label. In 1998 the line up changed again, keeping Matthew Shipley and adding Steven Walker (guitars), Ian Robbins (bass) and Jon Solomon (drums). In 1999 Ian was replaced by Nik Williams (bass). In 2001 they recorded a new album 'Soundtrack' with producer Hugh Jones but due to the collapse of the record company it was shelved. Finally in 2010 this album was released by Darla. In 2009 the original band line up, minus Richard Brown, reformed and tour mainly in the US but also did shows in the UK, Europe and Asia.

Moving to London in 1979, the band lost Brian Faloon who was replaced on drums by Jim Reilly. They recorded the LP ""Nobody's Heroes"" for Chrysalis, an LP which was more pop than ""Inflammable Material"" but continued exploring similar themes. A cover of The Specials' ""Doesn't Make It Alright"" was included, though less successfully than ""Johnny Was"". ""Nobody's Heroes"" was followed by the live LP ""Hanx"" as well as the pure power pop of the LPs ""Go For It"" and ""Now Then"" (featuring new drummer Dolphin Taylor, previously of [a=Tom Robinson Band]), which failed to satisfy their fans. In 1983 the band decided to call it a day.

(As a result of injuries sustained in a motor accident, LaBrittain was temporarily replaced by drummer Ed Case aka Paul Edwards in 1980.) Jon Watson left the band in 1985; being replaced by Danny Palmer, who remained with the band until 1991. Palmer was replaced by Arturo Bassick, who remains the bass guitarist with 999 to this date.

Between 1978 and 2007, 999 released fourteen singles and twelve studio albums. Five of the singles released by 999 between 1978 and 1981 charted within the Top 75 in the UK Singles Chart, with one further single released by 999 in 1978, Homicide, charting within the Top 40. In addition, as a result of extensive touring in the United States in the early 1980s, the band's third and fourth studio albums: The Biggest Prize in Sport and Concrete, each charted on the U.S. Billboard 200.

Despite having formed in 1976, 999 have only experienced two permanent changes to their original line-up and has continued to record and play live to the present day, leading AllMusic to describe the band as ""one of the longest-lived groups of the punk era."""

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

Ex-Grunties Melvyn Crawford (gtr) and Kerry Kirk (drums) originally wanted to audition Keine Namen’s Tim Naylor as a replacement singer when original vocalist - Tim Freeman (later of Frazier Chorus) - left due to ‘musical’ differences. Various hybrids of the Grunties and Keine Namen rehearsed over a few weeks around Xmas ’78 with the lineout stabilising around Melvyn who also took on vocal duties, Kerry on drums and Tim on bass and a bit of shouting. Keine Namen drummer Dave took on the manager’s mantle. Meanwhile, The Fastnets guitarist Jon Monks took on duties engineering the band’s sound and documenting various recordings, eventually joining the band as second guitarist.  

In January 1980 Controls debut EP on Stupid Rabbit Tapes was released - ‘Sock it to ‘em Dave’. Controls unwitting pioneering approach to releasing indie cassettes of their material got the band noticed and a short mention in Sounds resulted in around 500 sales of this 4 track cassette featuring ‘So Soon I Forget’, ‘Secrets’, ‘Nobodies Daughter’ and ‘Invited Few’, as well as numerous fanzine pieces and distribution offers.  A second release on the Stupid Rabbit Tapes, the 'Don't Adjust The Controls' album came out in the summer of 1980 and sold around 100 copies.  The band played numerous gigs including the punk, mod and new wave season at the Tumbledown Dick in Farnborough, a double-header with The Mental that degenerated in what the local newspaper later declared was 'The Crondall Village Hall Riot"" and a Beatle-esque performance on the roof of the cafeteria at Aldershot Lido's fiftieth anniversary event.

Personnel changes in the summer saw a different line up gigging in the Autumn and Winter of 1980 with Jim Rump on lead vocals and Mick Pendleton on lead guitar joining the Naylor/Kirk rhythm section.  This line up released the Late Night Love Songs album and was bootlegged on the Happy Sound of Eating live release tape.  The band also played a very well attended gig at The Wooden Bridge in Guildford.

Both line-ups of Controls appeared on X-Cassettes releases in 1981 - 'Anything Could Happen in the Next Half House' (X-002), 'Bits' (X-002) and 'Dance' (a Controls compilation)."

Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

Vega began his career as a visual artist, gaining notoriety for his ""light sculptures"" eventually opened his own lower Manhattan gallery space, which he dubbed the Project of Living Artists. The Project served as a stomping grounds for the likes of the New York Dolls, Television and Blondie as well as the 15-piece jazz group Reverend B., which featured a musician named Martin Rev on electric piano. Soon, Vega and Rev formed Suicide, whose minimalist, aggressive music - a fusion of Rev's ominous, repetitive keyboards and Vega's rockabilly snarl - helped pave the direction for the electronic artists of the future. 

Suicide disbanded in 1980, and both Vega and Rev undertook solo careers. Vega's self-titled 1980 debut and his 1981 effort Collision Drive continued to explore the fractured rockabilly identity he had established in his earlier work. 1983's Saturn Strip, produced by longtime fan Ric Ocasek, marked Vega's debut for Elektra Records; corporate relations soured during production for 1985's Just A Million Dreams, however, and at one point the label even attempted to remove the singer from his own studio sessions. Vega teamed up with Martin Rev and Ric Ocasek again in the late eighties to produce and release the third Suicide album, A Way of Life (1988). Shortly thereafter, Vega met future wife and music partner Elizabeth Lamere while piecing together sound experiments that would evolve into his fifth solo album, Deuce Avenue (1990). Deuce Avenue marked his return to minimalist electronic music, similar to his work with Suicide, in which he combined drum machines and effects with free-form prose. 

Over the next several decades he would release several more solo records and perform and release albums with Suicide. In 2012, Vega suffered a stroke. That, and problems with his knees, led him to focus on less physically demanding art, such as painting, however, he continued to perform at selected concerts and work on the music that led to his final studio album 'IT', which was released posthumously on July 14 on Fader. The album was produced by Alan Vega, Liz Lamere, Perkin Barnes and Jared Artaud of New York City band The Vacant Lots. 

The album cover and inner sleeves featured Vega's original artwork. Two posthumous art shows ""Dream Baby Dream"" at Deitch Gallery and ""Keep IT Alive"" at Invisible-Exports exhibited Alan Vega's work in New York City. In 2021, Sacred Bones Records releases 'Mutator', the lost Alan Vega album produced and mixed by Liz Lamere and Jared Artaud, the first in a series of unreleased and rare material from the Vega Vault.

The recording preserves the anarchic free spirit that surfaced from punk, but with art sound-scapes and experimental textures akin to Krautrock, mixed with an alternative funk dub.
For all these years the album has remained a firm favourite on the underground scene to the disaffected in the know-how.      

1981 saw the follow-up Intense Living with its collage cut-up cold graveyard cover, set against a New York skyline and songs innocently depicting mankind’s dark future. The experimental textures remain, but with a hefty wash of melody over the top. This was to be the last album Mex would release until the 21st century.
In the same year of ‘81, two immortal cuts Evil Creature and Functioning Fripp Girls appeared on the infamous Thing from the Crypt compilation album, re-released in February 2013 by Dark Entries Records.
Other isolated tracks also featured on various DIY compilations around that time and it was during this period Mex created the musical atmospheres for the surreal independent stage play, Dark of the Moon.

1983 saw Lost Moment Records release a Mex vinyl 7” containing a satirical 60s style infused song entitled Happy Life, coupled with the sinister acoustic b-side, Veins.

The malicious Don’t Go Looking for Love made its presence on the 1984 compilation album, Colours of the Bastard Art, also issued by Lost Moment Records.

To date and after two decades, Mex has been locked away with life’s disillusions and immersed in almost anonymous studio experimentation antics, only surfacing of late, whereby the 2014 album Dr Jekyll & Mrs Hyde, arrived."

First rising to fame as an integral member of the [a325097] in the late 1960s, Stanshall embarked on an idiosyncratic solo career when the Bonzos split up in 1970, astonishing in its variety and fertility but also broken up by long periods of inactivity as a consequence of his problems with alcoholism and depression.

Perhaps his most famous creation was the saga of Rawlinson End, sprawling spoken-word pieces interspersed with original songs. The stories began with a relatively short track on the final Bonzo Dog Band album ‘Let’s Make Up and Be Friendly’ but grew into 20-minute pieces on the [a64672] Show on [l134459], and resultant albums, from 1975 onwards. Depicting a world of English aristocracy that was part [a951168], part [a1481651], they were a showcase for Stanshall’s intricate wordplay and surreal imagination, along with his mellifluous and elastic voice.

Although Stanshall could be notoriously erratic and difficult to work with, he was involved in a number of collaborations with such artists as [a214188], [a17827], [a259772] and [a201571], and also created two solo albums notable for their varied musical styles and lyrics full of his perennial loves of rhyming slang, absurdist puns and tongue-twisters.

After a period of creative resurgence in the late 1980s that saw a number of Rawlinson End sessions for John Peel and a West End staging of his musical play ""Stinkfoot"" (partly financed by [a289153] and [a11136]), Stanshall’s drinking worsened in the 1990s and he perished in a fire at his flat in London on 5 March 1995, probably caused by an overturned lamp as he slept.

He left behind him a small but rich legacy of comic and musical originality, belying his popular image as simply the man who announced the instruments on [a18666]'s album ""Tubular Bells"".

Comprising the songwriting axis of Richard Jobson (vocals) and Stuart Adamson (guitar), together with the rhythm section of William Simpson (bass) and Tom Kellichan (drums), they rode into British consciousness on the new wave backwash to the ebbing tide of punk. The release of their self-financed, attention-grabbing Charles EP came at the time Richard Branson's Virgin label were busy accruing an eclectic roster of post-punk hopefuls. Consequently, with almost indecent haste, the band were tethered to what was to prove an optimistic eight-album deal. 

On the flip side of their first Virgin single, ""Sweet Suburbia"" (1978), the band proclaimed themselves to be ""Open Sound"", which was essentially a description of the soaring histrionics of Adamson's guitar style. When married to the martial rhythms of the drumming and the bellowing, chant-like vocals of Jobson, this sound conspired to lend their repertoire a rousing, anthemic quality. It was heroic music which at its best, as on the first album, Scared To Dance (1979), seemed to capture the drama and turbulence of battle. Unfortunately, the sound was an all-too-graphic reflection of the band's own stormy relationships, a turbulence which was to settle only with the departure of Adamson in the summer of 1981. 

The Skids' decline was in large part due to the portentous designs of Richard Jobson, who sought to mould the band into a vehicle for his ever more convoluted lyrics. This became most evident in the recording of the second album, Days In Europa (1979). Following the departure of original drummer Tom Kellichan in the traditional rock'n'roll style (i.e. after the first album), the Skids recruited a temporary replacement in the form of ex-Rich Kids drummer and Jobson cohort, Rusty Egan, and a producer in the form of ex- Be-Bop Deluxe man Bill Nelson. Together, both Nelson and Egan contrived to free the band from the strictures of punk-pop in favour of a more polished, almost danceable sound. Ultimately it was a case of too many cooks, and the resultant album proved to be a misguided attempt at redefining the Skids' sound. This in turn alienated a great many fans, and also cost them the services of bassist Simpson during the troubled tour that ensued. 

For Jobson and Adamson it was back to the drawing board, and 1980 saw a rejuvenated Skids with a new rhythm section in the form of Russell Webb (bass) and Mike Baillie (drums). The resultant album, The Absolute Game (1980), produced this time by Mick Glossop, was a commercial success, giving the band their first and only British Top 10 album. Artistically, too, it heralded a return to form, dispensing with the excess baggage of the previous outing and playing to the dual strengths of Adamson's guitar stylings and Jobson's lyrical bombast. Unfortunately, this rejuvenation coincided with Jobson's increasing commitment to a burgeoning London scene. Adamson's departure had as much to do with geographical differences as to musical and personal ones; a point evinced by Adamson's eventual return to Dunfermline, from where he formed the internationally successful Big Country. 

Following Adamson's departure, the final dissolution of the band was soon to follow. Unfortunately, however, not before Jobson and Webb issued a dour and ill-conceived concept album, Joy (1981), which served only to illustrate that, when Adamson left, he took all of the best tunes with him. Not surprisingly the album failed to chart, and proved a sorry end to a short career which had begun with so much spark and promise.

And then they came back. They reformed in 2017, recorded two new albums, a covers album, released a few live ones and a couple of acoustic albums too; while touring the UK, a lot.

Newport Street"" - recorded live in the street's club Studio 51, run by Vi Highland & Pat Mayhew, later to become the [a=Ken Colyer] Club. It was here that the band met and took on [a=Ray Sone] as harmonica player.

They signed a deal with [l=EMI]/[l=Columbia] in 1964, recording ""Baby What's Wrong"" and the album ""The Sect"". Their EP had gained attention on Swedish pirate radio and a single, ""Little Egypt"", reached No 2 in the Swedish charts in April, 1965 - at the same time Sone was replaced by Pip Harvey. Harvey left before the band recorded the album ""The Rock Sect's In"" and a single ""The Cost Of Living"", after which Gibson & Sutton quit the band. One notable session musician & arranger in four of their albums was [a=John Paul Jones].

In 1967 Craine and Grant formed a new line-up and continued as [a=Don Craine's New Downliners Sect]. (Including Bob Taylor, [a=Matthew Fisher], Kevin Flanagan, Barry Cooper). Craine & Cooper departed in 1967 and Grant took over the band to record Swedish releases on [l=Garageland Records], back under the name Downliners Sect.  After many lineup changes, the band continues to play together.

Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970's. Though often referred to as ""The Carpenters,"" their name on official releases and press materials was ""Carpenters."" During a period in the 1970's when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time.

Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, their parents decided to move the family west to Los Angeles, California. Richard and Karen originally played jazz, with Karen having an interest in playing the drums. They were briefly known as Spectrum and then Carpenters, where they then recorded for a small label, [l=Magic Lamp Records]. In their move West, they met Lou Adler who introduced them to [a=Herb Alpert], who signed them to his label, [l=A&M Records] in 1969.

While Richard penned compositions with writing partner, [a=John Bettis], many of the duos' hits were written by others and some were cover versions of established hits for other artists, such as [a=The Beatles] and Motown's, [a=The Marvelettes]. Their 1973 album, ""Now and Then."" B-side consists of a 9-song medley of 60's hits recorded like a radio show.

Carpenters' melodic pop, produced a record-breaking run of hits on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen #1 hits on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles (including their #1 hits). To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units.

During their 14-year career, Carpenters recorded 11 albums, five of which contained top 10 singles (""[m=84990],"" ""[m=84975],"" ""[m=84966],"" ""[m=85055]"" and ""[m=85013],"") thirty-one singles, five television specials, and one short-lived television series. They toured the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Belgium. Their recording career ended with Karen's death in 1983 from cardiac arrest due to complications of anorexia nervosa. Extensive news coverage of the circumstances surrounding her death increased public awareness of the consequences of eating disorders. "

 Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, and was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".
Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud but clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his effect on the blues genre, on helping to influence the revived production of the guitar, and on many other guitarists.

The Nitzsche-phone

Nitzsche was a keyboard player on many mid-1960s albums by The Rolling Stones. On several, he was also credited as the player of the ""Nitzsche-phone"". In an obituary on Gadfly Online, former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham explained the credit:

   "" I made that up for the credits on those Stones albums—it was just a regular piano (or maybe an organ) mic'd differently. It was all part of this package that was created around the Stones. People believed it existed. The idea was meant to be: ""My god, they’ve had to invent new instruments to capture this new sound they hear in their brains."" And they were inventing fresh sounds with old toys—therefore, it deserved to be highlighted—it was the read-up of creation, of imagination—getting credit for a job well done."""

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].
The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.
In 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).
They were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.

After 1981's Desire, the band relocated in an artist's commune in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Within a year though they were forced to leave and moved to Brussels, to find first shelter in the Plan K. (a live p.a. club). Reininger began to branch out as a solo artist. Tuxedomoon was also hired to score a Maurice Bejart ballet, the results of which were released in 1982 as Divine. Reininger left for a solo career in 1983 and was replaced by [a=Frankie Lievaart] and horn player [a=Luc Van Lieshout]. In between side projects and scoring, the band sought an international deal for their forthcoming LP Holy Wars; it was eventually released in 1985 and became the band's biggest commercial success. Tong left the group for good that year, leaving Brown and Principle the only remaining San Francisco members; multi-instrumentalist Ivan Georgiev was hired to replenish the group's sound for 1986's Ship of Fools album and tour. Scoring work from past projects has been reissued in Belgium.

Eminently unfashionable in the UK punk era, they first found success in Japan.

After three albums with Ariola-Hansa, they switched to Virgin Records in 1980 and found their fortunes dramatically improving thanks to the surge of popularity in the New Romantic movement. Japan's androgynous image made them suddenly fashionable and they registered several UK Top 20 singles. Their albums Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) and Tin Drum (1981) were also well received.  Rob Dean left the band after Gentlemen Take Polaroids but continued working with the band for one more tour thereafter.

Disagreements between Karn and Sylvian undermined the band's progress just as they were achieving some long-overdue success, and they split in late 1982.  The members diversified into collaborative work and solo careers, reuniting (minus Dean) in 1991 for a project under the moniker of Rain Tree Crow."

LaBeef stood 6' 7"" (2.0 metres) tall and was given the nickname ""Sleepy"" from the appearance of his eyes. He was raised on a melon farm and moved to Houston when he was 18. There, he sang gospel music on local radio and put together a bar band to play venues as well as radio programs such as the Houston Jamboree and Louisiana Hayride.

In the 1950s, as the rockabilly component of rock-n-roll became evident, LaBeef began recording singles in the genre; his first, ""I'm Through"", was issued on Starday Records in 1957. In 1964, he moved to Nashville and moved to a more solidly country style, recording singles for Columbia Records. His first genuine hit was in 1968 with ""Every Day"", which peaked at #73 on the U.S. Billboard Country charts. After moving to Plantation Records in 1969, he scored a second hit in 1971 with ""Blackland Farmer"", which charted at #67. Around this time LaBeef also starred in the horror movie The Exotic Ones. LaBeef transferred to Sun Records in the 1970s and continued releasing albums and touring widely; his popularity flagged in America but rose in Europe. The 1980s saw him sign to Rounder Records, where he released albums into the 1990s.

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

Wall of Voodoo had its roots in Acme Soundtracks, a film score business started by Stan Ridgway, who was later the vocalist and harmonica player for Wall of Voodoo. Acme Soundtracks' office was across the street from the Hollywood punk club The Masque and Ridgway was soon drawn into the emerging punk/new wave scene there. Marc Moreland, guitarist for local group The Skulls, began jamming with Ridgway at the Acme Soundtracks office and the soundtrack company soon morphed into a new wave band. In 1977, with the addition of Skulls members Bruce Moreland (Marc Moreland's brother) as bassist and Chas T. Gray as keyboardist, along with Joe Nanini (who had been the drummer for Black Randy and the Metrosquad) the first lineup of Wall of Voodoo was born.

The band was named Wall of Voodoo before their first gig in reference to a comment made by Ridgway's friend, bassist Joe Ramirez. Ramirez was listening to some of the Acme Soundtracks music Ridgway and Moreland had created in their studio. When Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine-and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector's legendary ""wall of sound"" production style, Ramirez commented it sounded more like a ""wall of voodoo"", and the name stuck."

Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.
