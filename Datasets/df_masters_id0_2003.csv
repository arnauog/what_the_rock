The band owes its origins to Mark and Nick Cope, Nick Burton and John Halliday all living in the same village, Islip, Oxfordshire, and attending the same local secondary school (Gosford Hill School) between around 1974 and 1980. The four Islip members of the band had begun working together by the time they left school and various line-ups and name-changes followed during the 1980s, until ""The Candyskins"" were formed in 1989, with Richard (mini) Brown on bass and banjo. After the successful release of the single ""Submarine Song"" in 1990, the band went into the studio to produce their first full-length album Space I'm In. The album included three singles: ""Submarine Song"", ""She Blew Me Away"" and ""You Are Here"". Brown left the band before the album was released.

After a year of touring and the replacement of a stand-in bass player with Karl Shale, the band released their second album Fun? on Geffen Records in 1993. Characteristically, the band attempted to build upon the US success of Space I'm In with an ironic album featuring songs about football and gardening. The poor selling record began an elongated legal dispute between the record company and the band, reportedly due to disagreements over songwriting royalties.

The album Sunday Morning Fever was released on Ultimate in the UK in 1997, and saw the band enjoy their biggest chart success with the single ""Monday Morning"" making it into the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The record company went bankrupt and the band were left in limbo during the recording of their last album Death of a Minor TV Celebrity. The album did not do as well as their previous efforts, despite featuring the single ""Feed It"" which was one of the central songs on the soundtrack to the movie The Waterboy starring Adam Sandler.

A favourable press honoured them with many UK gigs including Greenbelt Mainstage. A year later and the second ep Seasider hit european shores and was greeted with massive press and public praise. The Kato sound was born. Drawing from Keith's love of his seaside home and even the view from his window, their 97 ep Seasider is a rollercoaster of an album mixing dark, grungy pop with delicate passionate melodies. From the opener 'Superhero', which reached the Unisong 99 world songwriting finals, to the intimate 'Walking on Water' closing track there is no break from the unique brand of soul-quenching pop/rock. But just listening to the music is only half the story. Kato have a desire to perform which has taken them to many different countries and many different crowds. This desire is evident - there is energy and passion that transcends a purely commercial existence. Kato are not taking over the world - at least not for commercial reasons, but they are trying to change it.

Mother of [a=Bailey Tzuke] and [a=Tallula Tzuke].

Judie Myers was born in London to an English mother and a Polish extract father. After an education in the arts, music and drama, by the age of 15 Judie spent most of her time writing poems which she turned into songs and playing folk clubs, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. In 1975 she met [a=Mike Paxman] and together they started to write the songs that were to become her first releases. After making some demo tapes, they managed to get a record deal with David Bowie and T.Rex producer [a=Tony Visconti]'s label [l=Good Earth].

Judie decided to change her name back to her family's original surname, Tzuke. A single was released: ""[m=669261]"", which was recorded and produced by Tony Visconti and came out under the name of ""Tzuke and Paxo"". In 1977, Judie was signed to [a=Elton John]'s [l=Rocket Records (15)]. Judie and Mike spent the next six months or so recording her first album, [i][m=129063][/i], at [l=Air Studios] in London, with producer [a=John Punter]. The first single, ""[m=498611]"", was released in the summer of 1978 and was greeted with great critical acclaim and substantial air-play. [i]Welcome To The Cruise[/i] was released in 1979 along with the single ""[m=311393]"". The song stayed in the UK charts for 16 weeks, and she made three live appearances on [i]Top of the Pops[/i]. The song became a firm favourite and is still played regularly on radio in the U.K. It has appeared on dozens of compilation albums and regularly appears in lists of all time most popular songs.

Between 1979 and 1992, she released a number of albums for both large and small record labels before taking a hiatus to start a family. In 1996, she returned with [i][r=5090078][/i], her first album on her (and her partner, [a=Paul Muggleton]'s) own label, [l=Big Moon Records].

It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

233658.0,0,1724581,UK,Motörhead,The Bronze Age (1979 - 1982),2002,144.75,48,"['Compilation', 'Limited Edition']",['Rock'],"['Heavy Metal', 'Hard Rock']","Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister (1945–2015), professionally known by his stage name Lemmy, who had remained the sole constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Most of their original material was written by bassist/frontman [a=Conrad Lant] ([a=Cronos]) and guitarist [a=Jeffrey Dunn] ([a=Mantas]) and featured satanic imagery. Dunn left the band in 1986 and the group split the following year, with Lant forming a new band [a=Cronos (2)] with some of the other members. This left drummer [a=Anthony Bray] ([a=Abaddon]) as only original member. [a=Tony Dolan] ([a=Demolition Man (3)]) was recruited to replace frontman Lant.

Brutal Deluxe quickly gained recognition for taking to the stage barefooted, bedecked in their tribalistic warpaint and pounding their audience into submission with their dynamic live performance. They were signed in 1999 to Dreamcatcher Records and released their debut album Divine Head in early 2000. It received wide critical acclaim and the band was hailed as a great British hope. The band toured in 2000 with Raging Speedhorn, Kill II This and Napalm Death.

The band started 2001 with a headline tour through the UK, culminating in a filmed live show for MTV2 in London. Just prior to this show the band suffered a serious blow when all their equipment was stolen. This brought to a head strained relationships in the band, and the end result was the departure of bassist Toad.

A replacement was soon found and the band managed to move forward with the help of Richmo custom drums. They performed to 12,000 people at the Bulldog Bash with The Wildhearts and Feeder and continued to tour through 2001. The band then recorded their second album in 2002 entitled Mistah Kurtz...He Dead.

In 2006 the band parted ways with their label Dreamcatcher and began recording new demos in their studio in South London.

In 2007 the band showcased some new material on an EP and began searching for another new bass player. ""Guary MacSeanlaoic."" joined on bass and they signed to Chimerical Records on 29th January, 2009. Between June and December 2009 the Slagfreak Mobile recording Studio was used to record the bulk of the songs for the new album at the remote Clymping Mill (Clymping Gap) on the English Southcoast.

On later albums the band progressed away from their Thrash roots and became gradually more Folk-influenced, settling into a style more akin to early Heavy Metal.

Founder member Martin Walkyier departed the band in 2001, leaving Rhythm guitarist and longtime producer Kevin Ridley to take over vocal duties.

A favourable press honoured them with many UK gigs including Greenbelt Mainstage. A year later and the second ep Seasider hit european shores and was greeted with massive press and public praise. The Kato sound was born. Drawing from Keith's love of his seaside home and even the view from his window, their 97 ep Seasider is a rollercoaster of an album mixing dark, grungy pop with delicate passionate melodies. From the opener 'Superhero', which reached the Unisong 99 world songwriting finals, to the intimate 'Walking on Water' closing track there is no break from the unique brand of soul-quenching pop/rock. But just listening to the music is only half the story. Kato have a desire to perform which has taken them to many different countries and many different crowds. This desire is evident - there is energy and passion that transcends a purely commercial existence. Kato are not taking over the world - at least not for commercial reasons, but they are trying to change it.

Tindersticks were one of the most original and distinctive British acts of the '90s, standing apart from both the British indie scene and the rash of Brit-pop guitar combos that dominated the U.K. charts. Where their contemporaries were often direct and to the point, Tindersticks were obtuse and leisurely, crafting dense, difficult songs layered with literary lyrics, intertwining melodies, mumbling vocals, and gently melancholy orchestrations.

At the start of their career, the group filtered the dark romanticism of Leonard Cohen, Ian Curtis, and Scott Walker through the bizarre pop songcraft of Lee Hazlewood and the aesthetics of indie rock. Later recordings have been marked by the influence of soul music, and their excursions into instrumental soundtrack work (primarily working for director Claire Denis). Though their music was far from casual listening, Tindersticks gained a dedicated cult following in the mid-'90s, beginning with their eponymous 1993 debut album, and continue to release music to a dedicated fanbase."

Original members chosen for the perilous path by the very gods themselves were : WAYNE FIREFLY - Vocals and Bass, smokin' JAMES FLAMES - Guitar, IAN MAIDEN - Guitar, NICK FERATU - Drums. Playing their first show in November 1999 led onto a hard, constant year round touring schedule, sometimes putting 1000 miles a week on the van. This included Ireland, Europe, countless appearances on the Holidays In The Sun / Wasted festivals and tentative plans were made to attack the U.S.A.
Having played shows with such luminaries as Suicidal Tendencies, Poison Idea, D.R.I., Stiff Little Fingers, Conflict, G.B.H. U.K. Subs, Leftover Crack, Capdown, the Subhumans, Funeral for a Friend, the Wildhearts, the Vibrators, Vice Squad and the Damned to name a few, and with the release of their first album (CAN YOUR PUNY BODY SURVIVE?)) in 2001 on their own INFRA BLACK RECORDS, led to signing with popular punk / ska label GOOD CLEAN FUN RECORDS in 2002.
This unholy alliance led to the release of their second album (THE INCREDIBLE, UNSTOPPABLE TITAN OF TERROR) in 2003.
Since a split of the original lineup in June 2005 put the brakes on for a few months, and taking a few months of rethinking and rebuilding, remaining original founding member Wayne Firefly put another line up together to carry on the sonic slaughter. Finding new members, HARRY KARI and LAZ VEGAS, who took over guitars and drums respectively. Now down to a three piece during this period, the search was on for a second guitarist but to no avail.
The release of their third album entitled, ""PAIN IS ONLY TEMPORARY,GLORY LASTS FOREVER"", was December 2007. Put out again by their own INFRABLACK RECORDS label. November '08 saw the departure of drummer Laz Vegas. December '08 saw the arrival of TINMAN, (ex Instant Agony drummer.)
In November 2009, STUNTFACE took on another guitarist putting the line-up back to the preferred four piece. This character was known as STE FLAT BACK and is a veteran of his own pop punk band Flat Back Four.
STUNTFACE were no more in June 2010. Sometimes, you just have to know when to quit. Ironically after demoing 12 tracks for a 4th STUNTFACE album.. these demos still exist somewhere. That album was going to be called EL CASA DEL DIABLO if it ever saw the light of day. We were inspired by the likes of the Misfits, SNFU, Bad Religion, Minor Threat, NoFX, Motorhead, Propagandhi, Bad Brains and the Cro-Mags mixing up styles and sounds of the U.S. and U.K. hardcore punk scenes, playing fast and blasting but abrasively melodic punk rock anthems for everyone to commit mass murder to."

Three guitarists are caring for a lush sound based on hypnotic flowing rhythms where keyboards/synths are taking a backseat. The band recorded five official albums plus three EPs in total. As obligatory for some genre bands the members are credited with aliases respectively forenames only.

Their highest quality manifested around the mid 1990s with the albums 'Maya' (1992) and 'The Circle Never Ends' (1994). Both efforts are highly recommend and were recorded by Mitch (guitar, vocals), Loz (guitar), John (guitar, keyboard), Ben (bass) and Rupert (drums). STROBE broke up and played their last live gig back in 2001. The former band members are still in touch with each other and both Rupert and John play live music with other groups.

There are plans to release all the ep's on one disc under the name ""Singularities"" on Fuofo Records (2017).

The sextet released a single called ""Good old days"", containing an unreleased B-side: ""Life Is a Symphony"", before the album ""Turkey"" also in 1972, in the hope of confirming and improving the success of the first work, but it was not so. The record is less incisive than the previous one, despite the excellent technical skills of the musicians and the addition of keyboards, they churn out a good record but that has a lesser impact than the pfirst. After a couple of years without any new record production and having had other changes in the line-up, [a=Bernie Marsden] (Guitar) replaces Dyche and [a=Kevin Currie] (Drums) takes Jones's place and in the mid of 1974 Wild Turkey disband, each member takes different musical path. Until 1996, when [a=Glenn Cornick], supported by the band's historical members, give Life at the Wild Turkey's second era, reforming the group and recording the third album 22 years after their dissolution. The reunion of ""Stealer of Years"" on [l=HTD Records] involves: [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica), [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass, Mandolin, Penny Whistle), [a=Tweke Lewis] (Electric guitar and acoustics, Backing Vocals), [a=Brian Thomas (25)] (Drums) and [a=Lee Morris (10)] (Keyboards) as guest. The sound differs from the 70s Turkey, oriented more towards blues-rock than the hard-rock of the first records. Well arranged and performed, more melodic tracks alternate with others more in the Rock vein for a pleasant return on the scene. The band seems to be ready to walk the stage again, instead the following studio album takes another 10 years, during which only two albums containing live recordings from the previous period are released: ""Final Performance"" in 2000 and ""Live in Edinburgh"" in 2001 by [l=Audio Archives] label. In 2002, a collection containing a repertoire of studio recordings from the 1970s was released by the same label. In 2006 they came out ""You & Me In The Jungle"" produced on [l=Wild Turkey Music Ltd] and the artists involved are: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass), [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Harmonic), [a=Mick Dyche] (Guitar, Bass, Voice), [a=Steve Gurl] (Keyboards), [a=Clive Bunker] (Drums), Graham Williams (Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Percussions, Vocals). Again the sound of the album differs from the first two, the tracks are different from one to another by genre, some more Blues, others more Rock, passing through Boogie moments or more Melodics, always maintaining an high-level technique in the performance. The latest album released by Wild Turkey is the ""Live at Wellington 1973"" also on [l=Audio Archives].

77508.0,0,22116997,UK,Spear Of Destiny,Kings Of London - Live,2001,0.0,9,['Album'],['Rock'],['Post-Punk'],"Spear of Destiny is a British rock band, founded in 1983 by singer and songwriter Kirk Brandon (born 3 August 1956 in London) and bassist Stan Stammers (born 19 May 1961). It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

Then, after mixing it with the slightly 'bigger boys' Galahad decided take it more seriously, playing only original material resulting in the release of their first proper album in 1991, [i]Nothing Is Written[/i], which was purely self financed and released independently but which went on to sell several thousand copies. 

The success of [i]Nothing Is Written[/i] was also helped by the fact that the band received substantial air play on BBC Radio One, especially on the Radio One Rock Show hosted by the late, great Tommy Vance. The band then landed themselves with deals in the UK, Japan and Germany. 

The band has now released sixteen albums including albums by main band offshoots such as Galahad Electric Company and the Galahad Acoustic Quintet. The band has played hundreds of gigs in the UK, Europe and America over the last few years, at times in some very unusual venues!

In 2002 Galahad released [i]Year Zero[/i] which featured John Wetton (Asia, King Crimson, Family etc) on guest vocals. 

In September 2006 Galahad released their debut DVD [i]Resonance[/i], which was recorded live in Katowice, Poland in May 2006. 

Their next studio album [i]Empires Never Last[/i], which features Karl Groom (Threshold) on engineering duties, took the band in a heavier, more muscular, guitar orientated direction. This more contemporary, metallic approach seems to have worked as [i]Empires[/i] has proved to be the band’s most successful album to date, both commercially and critically, and resulted in them winning album of the year at the 2007 Classic Rock Society awards. [i]Empires[/i] was also included in many music web sites top tens for 2007.

2012 saw the band re-merge with not one but TWO new studio albums; [i]Battle Scars[/i] released in April and [i]Beyond the Realms of Euphoria[/i] in October, plus a live CD/DVD [i]Whitchurch 92/93 – Live Archives Vol. 2[/i] and to top it off, an official authorised biography of the band ‘One for the Record’ written by Andrew Wild was published in early 2013. 

2014 sees the band releasing a clutch of EP's throughout the year, plus a re-issue of [i]Empires Never Last[/i] which will be re-mixed and also include extra material."

Started by Richard Johnson (aka Richo, also of Fourth Dimension Records and Lumberton Trading Company, plus Adverse Effect writer and editor/publisher of Grim Humour), Stuart Carter (Scalpt, Heroin, The Fields of Hay) and Hassni Malik (The Vitamin B12, dROME), it originally set out to break away from Splintered's 'rock' trappings whilst still focusing on textures, drones, abstract sounds, etc. also to be found in them. The first album, On Parallel Shores Removed, took a couple of years to fall into place, but even then ultimately amounted to Theme struggling to find their feet in slightly new and different settings (that included drafting in female vocalists and noise guitar elements). Work on the second album, Our Angels Dislocated, took another few years to come together and was not ready to release until 2006. Far more focussed than the predecessor, it saw the group stripped down to its core trio and emphasising the often filmic yet forever organic textures much further. Vocals were sparse and buried, plus the presence of instruments such as sitar, singing bowls and piano helped drive things along. A third album by the group, Valentine (Lost) Forever, appeared in August 2009 on Israel's HCB Recordings. On this, Hassni was replaced by Jeanne Boyer on a few songs, plus the material itself is denser and owes more to Richo and Stuart's past concerns with the outer realms of psychedelia, noise and industrial music. There's also stronger focus on vocals, which are often cut-up, treated and looped. Steven Severin (ex-Siouxsie & the Banshees) also contributes a remix to this album.

Along the way, Theme have also contributed to a couple of compilations, plus have played a handful of sporadic shows throughout Europe, and collaborated with Faust's Jean-herve Peron and Budapest's Zsolt Sores. 

They continue to remain a nucleus of Richo and Stuart, but are sometimes given to working with others both live and on their recordings. Collaborators have also included Olga Drenda, Hayden Berry, Lukasz Kozak, Zsolt Varga, Tomek Choloniewski and others. During more recent years, their sound has becoming increasingly aggressive and intense. but are sometimes given to working with others both live and on their recordings.

He then taught popular music at Huddersfield Music College for three years whilst touring with the rock band Old Man Stone (Revolver) performing to festival crowds of 20,000 & pub 'crowds' of 2! 

Always having had an interest in the recording & producing process Barrie found himself increasingly behind the desk recording & mixing for Kaiser Chiefs, Corinne Bailey Rae & the wonderful Timmy Mallett in the studio as well as in front of it – he also ended up working as a mix engineer in Nashville.

In 1998, Barrie was introduced to the world of production music & instantly knew it was for him. He loves the freedom it gives him to explore different musical genres, getting the same enjoyment from composing an intense atonal documentary piece as playing kazoo on a silly kids romp.

FORMED in 1959 in response to the wave of excitable panic caused by the first generation of British rock 'n' rhythm, The Special Agents were originally a one man skiffle troupe led by AGENT GEOFF RUSSELL (guitar / Hammond organ).

THE first true configuration of The Agents coalesced in 1962 when guitarist AGENT ROD AIKEN (one time member of the 'Calendar News' house band, alongside legendary saxophonist Richard Whiteley) plus drummer and former prodigious child actor AGENT MIKE RAYNOR (star of such classic shows as ""Suburb of the Apes"" and ""Michael Monkey Muckles Many"") were added to the group.

THE SPECIAL AGENTS soon became legendary sessioneers. Forced into the studio at gunpoint in 1965 to perform as backing musicians to 'King of Merseybeat' Jimmy Tarbuck, The Agents met jobbing bassist AGENT CHRIS CREWE (real name Davros von Klinkerhoffen)...and a band was born!

Cynically co-opting the then-popular cinematic image of suave super spies, The Agents proceeded to hitch their cart to whichever bandwagon was coasting along Tin Pan Alley at the given moment: beatle pop, surf guitar, hammond beat or simple novelty rock 'n' roll.

THE SPECIAL AGENTS proceeded to spread their concept thinly over a series of many albums including ""A Sideboard of Sounds"" (1966), ""The Crazed Ideas of the Special Agents"" (1969) and the rare vocal excursion ""Voice of an Agent"" (1976), not to mention a string of singles for a plethora of different labels; for example, ""Bullet Proof"" (Intermediate, 1967), ""The Wailing Asteroid"" (Pie, 1976) and ""Valley of the Jason Kings"" (Stuff, 1983).

NOW, after an enforced period of detention, The Special Agents are BACK. They promise yesterday's sounds at tomorrow's prices...TODAY!

FROM HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, TO HER MAJESTY'S PRISONS...AND BACK AGAIN!!!!!!!!! We present...The Special Agents!

We met at school, and made a well crap demo there that really does not exist anymore. At this time, Ollie played guitar as well as singing, but we got a guy called Tom Rose in to play guitar as well. We recorded a couple of demos with this line-up, and then Tom Whitehouse joined in 1998, a bit before we recorded Tenpin Tackle. At some of the live gigs, we got Dave Cattell of Spine fame to come and scratch his decks, he's also the one rapping on ""You Are Nothing"". Soon after this demo was recorded, both Dan and Tom Rose left, and Adam Price filled in on drums, (check out Adam in the upcoming tour, he's now the Harpies' drummer) and Ade came in on second guitar. This motley crew recorded 'Lack Of A Better Name' in 1999, but the line up was short lived as Spine, Adam's other band, got signed and meant he couldn't play any more. So, Dan decided to rejoin and it's been the same line-up ever since then.

We recorded the 'Allstars' EP in March 2001, and Sucka-Punch records were interested. We recorded a few more tunes to make it into a full-length album, and this was put out on Sucka-Punch in October 2001 and is called 'Means To An End'. Around this time, we started touring around the place. We did a tour with spunge right after the album release, and followed that up with a mazin tour with the Mad Caddies in January 2002. We started writing more tunes after that, and got most of the 'Boxing Clever' material together over the summer. By this time, Moon Ska had heard some of our stuff and liked it, so we went into the DEP studios in Birmingham to record Boxing Clever for release on Moon Ska.

After the release of the album in October 2002, we did a few more tours with Bowling for Soup, spunge, and even our own headline tour with support coming from Schism and some other bands that won a Kerrang competition.
We haven't really done a great deal this summer (2003) other than keep up our day jobs to pay the rent - we seriously have never made a living out of the band. Anyway, cheers for reading this very short summary of a 7 year rollercoaster of fun, beer, biftas, gigs and stickers on boobs and cocks. We're touring soon, have a look at the gigs page for more information about dates and so on. Maaazin!

It is planned that, with his original rock instrumental album TUNES FOR GUITAR SLINGERS, released in 2002 and currently available (Rollercoaster Records RCCD 6009), the new blues album THE HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN BLUES, now re-packaged, (Rollercoaster 6015) and the new album FRAGILE CREATURES out NOW! (Rollercoaster 6014), the Willie Logan Band will not only be making more frequent appearances, but will become a more permanent venture.

As a freelance musician Willie is also records and produces for other artists and frequently lends his guitar slinging skills to their live performances.

After a short period of time, the line-up was changed, Weathers and Williams left, replaced by [a2067822] (Guitar and Voice) and [a=Jeff Jones (2)] (Drums). This line-up features the album ""Battle Hymn"" on [l=Chrysalis Music], dated 1971 in Hard-Rock style with Progressive and Blues-Rock veins. The electric guitar and vocals are the protagonists, supported by a solid rhythm section and the record alternates more pushed tracks with other more melodic. The feedback is positive for both critics and audiences, thanks in part to their excellent live performances supporting bands such as Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, Procol Harum, Yes, Ten Years After and Zz Top. Despite the success of the first album and the live band changed again, Blackmore left the group replaced by [a=Mick Dyche] (Slide Guitar, Guitar and vocals) and [a=Steve Gurl] (Piano) added to the five. The sextet released a single called ""Good old days"", containing an unreleased B-side: ""Life Is a Symphony"", before the album ""Turkey"" also in 1972, in the hope of confirming and improving the success of the first work, but it was not so. The record is less incisive than the previous one, despite the excellent technical skills of the musicians and the addition of keyboards, they churn out a good record but that has a lesser impact than the pfirst. After a couple of years without any new record production and having had other changes in the line-up, [a=Bernie Marsden] (Guitar) replaces Dyche and [a=Kevin Currie] (Drums) takes Jones's place and in the mid of 1974 Wild Turkey disband, each member takes different musical path. Until 1996, when [a=Glenn Cornick], supported by the band's historical members, give Life at the Wild Turkey's second era, reforming the group and recording the third album 22 years after their dissolution. The reunion of ""Stealer of Years"" on [l=HTD Records] involves: [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica), [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass, Mandolin, Penny Whistle), [a=Tweke Lewis] (Electric guitar and acoustics, Backing Vocals), [a=Brian Thomas (25)] (Drums) and [a=Lee Morris (10)] (Keyboards) as guest. The sound differs from the 70s Turkey, oriented more towards blues-rock than the hard-rock of the first records. Well arranged and performed, more melodic tracks alternate with others more in the Rock vein for a pleasant return on the scene. The band seems to be ready to walk the stage again, instead the following studio album takes another 10 years, during which only two albums containing live recordings from the previous period are released: ""Final Performance"" in 2000 and ""Live in Edinburgh"" in 2001 by [l=Audio Archives] label. In 2002, a collection containing a repertoire of studio recordings from the 1970s was released by the same label. In 2006 they came out ""You & Me In The Jungle"" produced on [l=Wild Turkey Music Ltd] and the artists involved are: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass), [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Harmonic), [a=Mick Dyche] (Guitar, Bass, Voice), [a=Steve Gurl] (Keyboards), [a=Clive Bunker] (Drums), Graham Williams (Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Percussions, Vocals). Again the sound of the album differs from the first two, the tracks are different from one to another by genre, some more Blues, others more Rock, passing through Boogie moments or more Melodics, always maintaining an high-level technique in the performance. The latest album released by Wild Turkey is the ""Live at Wellington 1973"" also on [l=Audio Archives].

It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

The wall of noise produced by the band encompasses very untraditional drums sound supplied in the form of distorted 909 kick drums, and industrial sound scapes with general destructive elements used to enhance sonic assault. With twin vocal attacks and machine gun vocals rhythms the band stop at nothing to express their hatred on humanity. 

The Berzerker was created as a solo studio project in 1995 and went on to release various EP's on labels such as 
Industrial Strength (USA), Speedcore (GERMANY)and Widerstand (AUSTRIA). 1998 saw the initial contact with Earache Records (UK) with the re-mixes of the Morbid Angel tracks Day of Suffering, Abominations and The Ancient Ones. 
The Berzerker was offered a contract with Earache Records for a number of full-length albums shortly afterwards, 
and in 2000 the Self-Titled album was released and the live act was born. 

The bands first film clip for the track ""Reality"" was banned by the ITC (independent television commission) and MTV due to excessive strobe lighting and horrific images, including the appearance of the band. 

In early 2001 the band headed off on a successful 27 show tour of the USA and Canada.

And in 2002/03 the band embarked on a World Tour to support their album Dissimulate this saw over 100 shows played across Australia, USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and many more. They did full month long tours with bands such as toured with such bands as Nile, Napalm Death, Strapping Young Lad, Vader, Immolation and many more...

Brutal Deluxe quickly gained recognition for taking to the stage barefooted, bedecked in their tribalistic warpaint and pounding their audience into submission with their dynamic live performance. They were signed in 1999 to Dreamcatcher Records and released their debut album Divine Head in early 2000. It received wide critical acclaim and the band was hailed as a great British hope. The band toured in 2000 with Raging Speedhorn, Kill II This and Napalm Death.

The band started 2001 with a headline tour through the UK, culminating in a filmed live show for MTV2 in London. Just prior to this show the band suffered a serious blow when all their equipment was stolen. This brought to a head strained relationships in the band, and the end result was the departure of bassist Toad.

A replacement was soon found and the band managed to move forward with the help of Richmo custom drums. They performed to 12,000 people at the Bulldog Bash with The Wildhearts and Feeder and continued to tour through 2001. The band then recorded their second album in 2002 entitled Mistah Kurtz...He Dead.

In 2006 the band parted ways with their label Dreamcatcher and began recording new demos in their studio in South London.

In 2007 the band showcased some new material on an EP and began searching for another new bass player. ""Guary MacSeanlaoic."" joined on bass and they signed to Chimerical Records on 29th January, 2009. Between June and December 2009 the Slagfreak Mobile recording Studio was used to record the bulk of the songs for the new album at the remote Clymping Mill (Clymping Gap) on the English Southcoast.

Krayon Angels (Original band moniker, ""Crayon Angels"", & named after the [a558172] song of the same title) were a short lived British rock band between 1968-1969 with strong American west coast psychedelic pop flavour. The group were managed by the American expatriate, Emperor Rosko, legendary '60s Radio Luxembourg British disc jockey. [a390114] aka Mike Pasternak is the older brother to Jeff Pasternak (ex [a847525]). Krayon Angels recorded a demo album in 1969 produced by Emperor Rosko at Radio Luxembourg Studios that was not commercially released at the time. Posthumously released on Dig The Fuzz Records in 2000. 

After Krayon Angels disbanded in spring 1969, Stuart McDonald & Lou Martin continued playing with British heavy blues rock band [a1171794]. Darryl Read along with Jesse Hector formed the earliest British proto punk band [a1669821] in summer 1969. In 1969-1970 the American expatriates, Jeff Pasternak & Chris Gibbons formed the songwriting duo Bastado Jones and cut an unreleased album.

Mother of [a=Bailey Tzuke] and [a=Tallula Tzuke].

Judie Myers was born in London to an English mother and a Polish extract father. After an education in the arts, music and drama, by the age of 15 Judie spent most of her time writing poems which she turned into songs and playing folk clubs, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. In 1975 she met [a=Mike Paxman] and together they started to write the songs that were to become her first releases. After making some demo tapes, they managed to get a record deal with David Bowie and T.Rex producer [a=Tony Visconti]'s label [l=Good Earth].

Judie decided to change her name back to her family's original surname, Tzuke. A single was released: ""[m=669261]"", which was recorded and produced by Tony Visconti and came out under the name of ""Tzuke and Paxo"". In 1977, Judie was signed to [a=Elton John]'s [l=Rocket Records (15)]. Judie and Mike spent the next six months or so recording her first album, [i][m=129063][/i], at [l=Air Studios] in London, with producer [a=John Punter]. The first single, ""[m=498611]"", was released in the summer of 1978 and was greeted with great critical acclaim and substantial air-play. [i]Welcome To The Cruise[/i] was released in 1979 along with the single ""[m=311393]"". The song stayed in the UK charts for 16 weeks, and she made three live appearances on [i]Top of the Pops[/i]. The song became a firm favourite and is still played regularly on radio in the U.K. It has appeared on dozens of compilation albums and regularly appears in lists of all time most popular songs.

Between 1979 and 1992, she released a number of albums for both large and small record labels before taking a hiatus to start a family. In 1996, she returned with [i][r=5090078][/i], her first album on her (and her partner, [a=Paul Muggleton]'s) own label, [l=Big Moon Records].

Since then she has continued to self release live and studio albums on a regular basis, subsequently licensing out a number to other companies such as [l=Wrasse Records]."

The band was formed in 1992, under its previous name, The Fauves, by Myburgh Grobbelaar (vocals), Albert Loubser (guitar), Dylan Kemlo (bass guitar), Timothy Rankin (drums) and David Poole (saxophone) in Somerset West at Parel Vallei High School.

In 1995 guitarist Albert Loubser (later known as Albert Frost) left the band to join the Blues Broers and was replaced by Alan Bainbridge. The band then changed its name to Dorp, the current name. Shortly thereafter, vocalist Myburgh Grobbelaar left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Pieter Bezuidenhout, the current frontman.

In 1996, Dorp released its first album, Indigenous Jewellery, independently, on a label set up by Bezuidenhout, Oom Gert Records. The album had limited distribution and is now out of print. The band changed guitarists once more; Alan Bainbridge left and was replaced by current guitarist Kevin Kieswetter.

The band recorded its second release, a 5-track EP called Five Steps Off The Pacemaker in 1997 on Wildebeest Records, which had a wider distribution. The band released its third disc in 1998, Danger Gevaar Ingozi.

In 1999 the band decided to relocate to London to try to break international radio. Shortly after arriving, the bassist, drummer and saxophonist returned to South Africa, leaving only singer Piet and guitarist Kevin. They resorted to busking in Covent Garden to pay for food and accommodation. It was not long before they attracted the attention of a Frenchman, Fred Fred Caïou (later known as Fred KU). They gigged for a while, experimenting with different sounds including ""drill ’n’ bass disco"". The three-piece recorded an EP, called Boy/Girl, the title track being the first song Piet wrote after the relocation. They eventually enlisted the help of Londoner Rob Driver, to take the drumming seat.

Already making waves, and eccentric new sounds, the arrival of Driver set the Dorp project spectacularly on the way, with four global influences crashing together to forge a virgin sound. Driver's UK rock influences and Caïou’s love of techno made something even wilder when combined with Piet and Kevin’s unique perspective.

The band released its 3rd full length album in 2002 called Tap Into The System on Contains Nut Records.

The band's first rehearsals  - at Matt Woodward's house in the LS6 area of Leeds - were a marked departure from their previous band Kito (a hardcore and metal crossover) and showed influences ranging from post-rock and post-hardcore to indie rock, with their main early influences being Chicago band Tortoise and Washington DC band Hoover. 

Jonathan Nash joined on bass guitar - himself a resident of Leeds and former member of the band Weedon. 

Having played a number of shows around the UK between 2000 and 2001 the band went on to produce their first release, 'Meetings With Remarkable Machines', produced by ex-Bob Tilton bassist Mark Simms and recorded at Hall Place studios in Leeds. The mini-album, released on CD by Munster-based label 5nach3, showed the band's development as an intricate, experimental post-rock unit, and mixed song structures with interludes.

Between 2002 and 2004 the band toured Europe extensively, playing shows in Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands before returning to the studio in 2004 to record 'II'. The album was recorded at Cottage Road studio in Leeds. with producer Matthew Peel. Continuing the songs / interludes theme set by their debut recording the band delivered a more joyful, playful, pop sensibility with their second release, and showed influences ranging from afrobeat, jazz, funk and indie rock. By late 2004 the band were moving into similar territory to Chicago acts such as 5ive Style, Euphone, and Heroic Doses. 

The band split in 2005, with Jonathan Nash going on to play in Cowtown (guitar / vocals), Brown Owl (bass guitar), Nope (drums), Hookworms (drums), and Game_Program (solo electronic project). Matthew Woodward went on to play with The Lapse (New York, US) and played in a number of Leeds bands including Cissy, Bosco, Klugman Town Band, and Casino Volante, before founding the current bands Azores and Galaxians.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

The name of the band originally comes from a marriage council guidance course, those who are unmarried are nowhere near the garden; the garden being the biblical garden of eden/perfection. Whatever you say pastor! Other theories include (but are not limited to) references to beer gardens, horticultural disasters, plant allergies and the mould growing on Jason's bed sheets (you wouldn't want to go anywhere near that garden).

Garden party - The boys once ran up a £1175 bar tab in 4 days. 

The guitarist can't tell Kurt Cobain from James Hetfield - James doesn't listen to music on purpose, Jason and Rog once had to tell him who Kurt Cobain was. 

Metallicas sound man comes to the rescue Big Mick Hughes once got a call to help the band in a small smokey pub where he fixed a tiny vocal PA that had packed in. He has done sound for NNTG twice. The behind the scene stories this guy tells are priceless! 

Young musician of year - when not playing in the garden Jason is a classical percussionist; he has played with the CBSO and was a semi finalist in the young musician of the year competition. He graduated from music college on the Friday of Glastonbury. Rog is a classically trained composer (the two met at Birmingham Conservatoire) and has written a number of chamber, choral and orchestral pieces. 

Stolen gear - June 2003 the band had all of their gear stolen, £9000 in total. Other bands, friends and fans rallied round and supported by lending instruments and even donating cash. Regional TV and radio support as well. Gear is still missing.

Senheisser competition winners - rog entered a competition advertised in Q. The band came 1st out of 1300 entries from UK and abroad. Band won 1st prize: £2500 cash, £2500 gear (which came in handy after the theft) and a spot on Glastonbury 04."

Within a year, the band's line-up consisted of drummer Dean Johnson, guitarist Tom Roberts (AKA Pig Champion) and bassist Glen Estes. The band was influenced by the like of The Germs, Black Flag, Discharge and SOA. Chris ""Tense"" replaced Glen on bass by the time of their 1983 debut EP, Pick Your King. This and its follow up, Record Collectors are Pretentious Assholes (featuring parts of Pig Champion's record collection on the cover), were both put out on the Fatal Erection label, run by Pig Champion and Malcom Conover from Eugene, Oregon.

In 1986, Poison Idea released the Kings of Punk LP on Pushead's Pusmort label. In the next few years, theirs line-up (mainly the rhythm section) changed several times.

By 1989, they started their own label, American Leather, and began by reissuing their 1982 demo. The band recorded the Discontent 7"" with the line-up of Jerry A., Pig Champion, Myrtle Tickner and Thee Slayer Hippie (the second guitarist switched between ""Mondo"" and Aldine Strichnine). In 1990, they released the Feel the Darkness LP.

In the next three years, they put out several more records - two more full-lengths, some 7""s and an LP collection of cover versions. When Pig Champion decided to leave the band in 1993, they split up. In 1996, the band briefly reformed and recorded a 7"" for Taang!, who also reissued most of their early catalogue. An aborted tour in 1997 saw another break-up, followed by further reformations. In 2017 the group disbanded for good.

One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer). In 2016 [a=Jeremy Stacey] (drums, keyboards) joined as an eighth member making the group a ""double quartet"".

The band toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Levin and Jakszyk had earlier said that the North America tour was probably the band's last there."

They began as a folk-rock group, added lead guitarist [a361998], drummer [a499363], singer [a1198456], and bassist [a2550313], who was soon replaced by [a362002]. The group was signed by [l11358], and their debut album charted (#128), selling 10,000 copies in the San Francisco area. Anderson left to have a baby and was replaced by [a346261], Spence left to form [a350475] and was replaced by [a399027], which began the group's definitive lineup. They performed at the Woodstock and Altamont festivals but then had its second major shakeup when Dryden left in 1970 to join [a476171] (he was replaced by [a361991]), and the band stopped touring when Slick became pregnant by Kantner. Kaukonen and Casady formed [a381929] In 1971, but remained members of the Airplane. The same year the group formed its own label, [l982249], distributed by RCA. In February 1974 Slick and Kantner officially formed the [a131970], which brought the original phase of the group to a close.

The band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a Performer."

""THE OPPRESSED Oi! STORY. 1981 / 202?.
Oi! STORY - THE 80s. 
March 1981, Russel (DUCKY) Payne is released from Borstal and I get released from Prison. At the time we didn't know each other and it's just coincidence that we were both banged up for violence. Anyway, Ducky (GUITAR), his brother Ronnie (BASS) and Gary Tier (DRUMS), all Cardiff Skins, along with Martin Brennan (VOCALS) a valley Skin, form an Oi! band. After tossing a few names around, including FORCED OPPRESSION, they decide that THE OPPRESSED fits the bill. So it was that with not much ability and a ton of enthusiasm the boys set out to have a ball. While all this was going on I was forming INSANITY SQUAD with me on guitar, my brother Dom on bass, his mate Vince King on vocals, and a nutter called Ed Flemming on drums. Me and Vince was Skins and Dom and Ed was Punks so that made us Cardiffs first Skunk band. We played a few local gigs, recorded nothing and fell apart after trying play a gig so pissed we couldn't see straight. Back at Duckys house Ronnie had left the band. No big story, he just wasn't into it. Looking for a new bass player they ask my mate if he wanted to join but he couldn't play a triangle so he suggested me. I'd seen their first gig and I remember telling my missus how ""I should be in that band"". So Ducky, Gary and Brennan eventually turn up on my doorstep and make me an offer I couldn't refuse. I suggested Dom on Bass with me as second Guitarist and the boys were all happy. This was around Xmas 1981 and this line up lasted about a year. Brennan and Gary had decided to leave so I took over vocals and we found the Kid, Lee Jenkins, to take care of drumming. Lee was from Risca, about 20 miles out of Cardiff, a 16 year old Skin who told me ""I'm fucking brilliant"" when I asked him if he was any good, and ""course I have, that's why I'm fucking brilliant"" to ""got a kit?"" This line up lasted about 2 years and recorded nearly everything issued in the eighties. Almost all our gigs ended in a ruck (boys will be boys) and eventually we just got pissed off with whole thing. We did get together in the studio with Juan Garcia, a punk from near Cardiff on drums. We recorded 3 cover versions but played no gigs. So that was it for the eighties. Less than 4 years but it seemed like a lifetime...... 
Oi! STORY - THE 90s. 
After the split in '84, I spent the next 6 years setting up and running my Oi! Records and Ska Records labels, helped to establish S.H.A.R.P and in 1987/8 I put together The Rude Boys with my brothers Dom and Adrian (R.I.P), and 3 sax players. By the end of the eighties the Rude Boys had fallen apart and the labels were struggling. There was a baby (THE Oi! BOY) on the way so I give up on music and got a job. I put The Oppressed back together in 1994 after some Fascist shite had been putting up C'18 (Ni**ers Out) stickers in my area. I tore off the stickers and thought ""fuck this"" and set out to use the bands profile to Fight Fascism again. For the next 2 years me, Dom and Adrian recorded some Anti-Fascist records including the benefit E-P ""FUCK FASCISM"". We played a few local ""Shows for the Boys"" including our farewell gig with the Warriors which was filmed for the THEY THINK IT'S ALL OVER - IT IS NOW video. Although this was our farewell gig we received an offer we couldn't refuse, to play the Camden Irish Center for ANTI-FASCIST ACTION (Oct' 5th 1996).The Business had a gig wrecked by C'18 because they wouldn't have C'18 provide security. The Fascists then announced that no Oi! bands could play London without C'18 security. The lads from A-F-A said ""FUCK THAT"" and arranged a concert for us. Floyd was now in the band on guitar and this was his one and only gig with us. The Stage Bottles had come from Germany to support us. It was a top night. Just like back in '81, no trouble at all. It was one of our best gigs and, not surprisingly, C'18 became invisible men. 1998 saw us back together with a new drummer (YAN) to do some more recording and we've done nothing since.... 
Now it's 2004 and we're back in rehearsals. The latest line up is still me, Dom and Floyd, with Tony Kizmus (ex-Societys Rejects) on drums.. If it all goes well we'll be back for the odd festival later in the year. 
Oi! STORY - THE 00s 
Since writing this we spent 2005 playing all over Europe and did one night in Canada for the Insurgence Records boys which was filmed for the Brotherhood DVD with The Prowlers. I hit 50 in 2006 and decided it was a good time to close the book on the band. 
Now it's 2010 and we're back for another load of gigs....
So now it’s 2016 and after playing all around the world it’s time to call it a day. Problems with my health and hitting 60 contributed to the decision but I look back with pride.... 
It’s now 2020 and at the grand old age of 63 I’ve put the band back together. This time Ducky’s back on guitar. After a 36 year break it’s great to have him back in the band he started 39 years ago. The 2 new boys are Che on drums and Ross on bass. Both boys are from Bridgend and also play in South Wales Punk band The Evil Turkeys. They’re great lads with a wicked sense of humour and fitted right in. 
Cheers one and all. 
It’s been emotional.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Mother of [a=Bailey Tzuke] and [a=Tallula Tzuke].

Judie Myers was born in London to an English mother and a Polish extract father. After an education in the arts, music and drama, by the age of 15 Judie spent most of her time writing poems which she turned into songs and playing folk clubs, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. In 1975 she met [a=Mike Paxman] and together they started to write the songs that were to become her first releases. After making some demo tapes, they managed to get a record deal with David Bowie and T.Rex producer [a=Tony Visconti]'s label [l=Good Earth].

Judie decided to change her name back to her family's original surname, Tzuke. A single was released: ""[m=669261]"", which was recorded and produced by Tony Visconti and came out under the name of ""Tzuke and Paxo"". In 1977, Judie was signed to [a=Elton John]'s [l=Rocket Records (15)]. Judie and Mike spent the next six months or so recording her first album, [i][m=129063][/i], at [l=Air Studios] in London, with producer [a=John Punter]. The first single, ""[m=498611]"", was released in the summer of 1978 and was greeted with great critical acclaim and substantial air-play. [i]Welcome To The Cruise[/i] was released in 1979 along with the single ""[m=311393]"". The song stayed in the UK charts for 16 weeks, and she made three live appearances on [i]Top of the Pops[/i]. The song became a firm favourite and is still played regularly on radio in the U.K. It has appeared on dozens of compilation albums and regularly appears in lists of all time most popular songs.

Between 1979 and 1992, she released a number of albums for both large and small record labels before taking a hiatus to start a family. In 1996, she returned with [i][r=5090078][/i], her first album on her (and her partner, [a=Paul Muggleton]'s) own label, [l=Big Moon Records].

Since then she has continued to self release live and studio albums on a regular basis, subsequently licensing out a number to other companies such as [l=Wrasse Records]."

The name Radiohead comes from the [a=Talking Heads] song, ""Radio Head"", from the ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/master/39386]True Stories[/url]"" album.

Formed by school friends in 1985, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's ""[r=767600]"". The cathartic ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Creep/master/21481]Creep[/url]"", from the debut album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Pablo-Honey/master/13344]Pablo Honey[/url]"" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves.

Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]"" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]'s expressive singing. The album featured the hits ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High & Dry[/url]"", ""[r=1463625]"" and ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]"".

The band's third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]"" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990s, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]"" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.

""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]"" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]"" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]"", was released in May 2016.

With their first records, Ride created a unique wall of sound that relied on massive, trembling distortion in the vein of [a=My Bloody Valentine] but with a simpler, more direct melodic songwriting approach. The shatteringly loud, droning neo-psychedelia the band performed was dubbed ""shoegazing"" by the British press because the band members stared at their many guitar effects pedals while they performed. After the 1992 album ""Going Blank Again"", the band shed their shoegazing tendencies and released 1994's ""Carnival Of Light"", an album deeply indebted to bands of the 1960s and 70s. Following a lukewarm critical and fan reception towards that album, they released one more album in a similar retro/classic rock vein, ""Tarantula"", in 1996, immediately breaking up over inter-band tensions regarding direction and ongoing songwriting/leadership squabbles. Twenty years later, they reformed amicably and have since released three more well-regarded full length albums that have largely been considered a return to form."

Paul Draper - Vocals, Guitar
Dominic Chad - Lead Guitar
Stove King - Bass
Andie Rathbone - Drums

Originally named Manson after mass murderer Charles Manson.  When they signed to Parlophone, they were asked to change their name due to threatened legal action by the Charles Manson Estate, so they substituted the ""O"" for a ""U"", and one of the stories they put out was that they were named after the Verve song ""A Man Called Sun"".

The band was formed in 1995 by Paul Draper, Dominic Chad and Stove King, and (after some initial lineup turbulence) were joined in 1996 by Andie Rathbone. Their debut album '[m=9392]' charted at UK #1 on its week of release; with 1998's follow-up '[m=71885]' charting at #6. The third full-length '[m=213145]' didn't sell as well and the band disappeared into obscurity for a short while. In 2002, the band announced a small tour of the UK to test out new material destined for their fourth studio album. However the fourth album was never released and in May 2003, an announcement was made by Dominic Chad that the band were calling it a day due to ""artistic differences"".

Fans petitioned Parlophone records to release the fourth album and in 2004 Parlophone released '[m=71889]', a 3xCD set of unreleased recordings, home demos and live material. This was later followed up by '[m=323941]' in 2006.

The music covers many genres and is really quite difficult to pigeonhole. Songs were often extremely short, one is a second long. The only instruments are guitar, bass and drums, with the three members swapping instruments on each track. A big feature is the use of absurd and grotesque lyrics, all written by Marky Loo Loo, mostly when he was a teenager.

Aside from many tape cassettes and their split 7"" with Melt-Banana, their only full length vinyl album was bankrolled and distributed by West Yorkshire experimental music and alcohol fanzine Just Glittering (the precursor to Idwal Fisher).

After being on hold since 2001, the band came back together in 2011 and started work on a new album.

Singapore but in ltaly a few years earlier. The boys were touring in an unforgiving bright orange T967 Cadillac ambulance
(as one does!) and unknowingly pulled into a notorious drinkers hangout residing on a lone rivers edge. The premise was
aptly named ‘River Bar’. This inlamous bar was veritably littered with empty bottles and broken hearts and it was here they
decided to give a concert — their iirst as a duo. Fortunately the music was embraced and the local spirits in all manner lifted.
Enthused by this new lound collaboration the boys packed up and headed down the highway in search of o deserving
band name and expresso. It was on this occasion they hit upon the name Vigilante Safari Mafia — Vigilante seen on the
side oi a security vehicle, Salari a name to be lectured on a forthcoming Vamos album and Malia because the boys were
now ensconced deep in the south oi Italy. Unwittingly they soon learned (by way oi no bookings) that Malia in a band name
was certainly not welcome among Italian festival organisers. Next consideration was the Kamikaze Vespa Club attributed to
the maniacal motorcyclists zooming up and down the auto strada at more than questionable speeds, but this name was also
short lived and finally they became known as The Famous Unknowns.

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.

The band consists of Matthew Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, piano), Christopher Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums, backing vocals). Dan Lancaster joins Muse on live stage since 2022 (previously Morgan Nicholls) for additional instruments and vocals.

Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as ""Butterflies & Hurricanes"", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.

Black Holes & Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as ""Supermassive Black Hole"". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009), loosely based on the novel 1984, and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, was released on November 9th, 2018. Will of the People, their latest to date album, was released on August 26th, 2022 and is inspired by the current years events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, riots, Black Lives Matter movement, and so on.

Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

Staples] (vocals), [a=David Boulter] (organ & accordion), [a=Neil Fraser (2)] (guitar), [a=Dickon Hinchliffe] (guitar & strings) [a=Al Macaulay] (percussion & drums) and John Thompson (bass), who was replaced by [a=Mark Colwill] before their first recordings. They recorded six studio albums, two additional soundtrack albums, and many singles in the first stage of their career. 

After a hiatus between 2004 and 2008, the band's line-up was reduced down to Staples, Boulter and Fraser, with a rhythm section of  [a=Earl Harvin] (drums) and [a=Dan McKinna] (bass) (and intermittent appearances by [a215721] and [a83515]). Their second act now eclipses their first line-up in terms of volume of output (if not commercial success).

Tindersticks were one of the most original and distinctive British acts of the '90s, standing apart from both the British indie scene and the rash of Brit-pop guitar combos that dominated the U.K. charts. Where their contemporaries were often direct and to the point, Tindersticks were obtuse and leisurely, crafting dense, difficult songs layered with literary lyrics, intertwining melodies, mumbling vocals, and gently melancholy orchestrations.

At the start of their career, the group filtered the dark romanticism of Leonard Cohen, Ian Curtis, and Scott Walker through the bizarre pop songcraft of Lee Hazlewood and the aesthetics of indie rock. Later recordings have been marked by the influence of soul music, and their excursions into instrumental soundtrack work (primarily working for director Claire Denis). Though their music was far from casual listening, Tindersticks gained a dedicated cult following in the mid-'90s, beginning with their eponymous 1993 debut album, and continue to release music to a dedicated fanbase."

One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer). In 2016 [a=Jeremy Stacey] (drums, keyboards) joined as an eighth member making the group a ""double quartet"".

The band toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Levin and Jakszyk had earlier said that the North America tour was probably the band's last there."

The band was formed in 1993 as ""[a3007400]"" by Alexi Laiho and Jaska Raatikainen. Different sources tend to categorize them stylistically in different ways, but according to the lead singer and guitarist Alexi Laiho, ""it's just metal and that's it"".

In 1997, Inearthed made a record deal with a small Belgian label to release their first album ""Something Wild"", but before the release the band was contacted by [l=Spinefarm Records], who also wanted to work with the band. Since they were already signed to another label, they had to fake a split-up and change the name to be able to release the album through Spinefarm. They chose ""Children of Bodom"" as the new name, inspired by the unsolved Lake Bodom murders, which took place in Finland in 1960 (teenagers camping next to the Lake Bodom were slaughtered by a maniac).

In November 2019 Raatikainen, Seppälä and Wirman announced that they were leaving the band, which also marked the end of Children of Bodom. Their final performance was in the Helsinki ice hall on December 15, 2019. Since he wouldn't be able to legally continue performing under the ""Children of Bodom"" banner, Alexi Laiho formed ""Bodom After Midnight"" in March 2020.

The original line up consisted of Fee Waybill (Vocals), Rick Anderson (Bass), Prairie Prince (Drums), Roger Steen (Guitar and Vocals), Bill Spooner (Guitar and Vocals), Vince Welnick (Keyboards), and Michael Cotten (Synthesizer), with Mingo Lewis (Drums and Percussion) and Re Styles (Vocals) expanding the lineup to nine members during their time on A&M Records. Their live performances were surreal vaudeville shows in which songs became full fledged production numbers. 

The Tubes scored their first hit ""White Punks on Dope,"" on their self-titled debut album released on A&M records. Their second album, “Young And Rich,""  included their second hit single – the suggestive duet “Don't Touch Me There.""  The Tubes released three more albums on A&M before being dropped in 1982, slimming back down to the original lineup. Capitol Records signed them upon their release from A&M and they released their most successful album to date, the concept album “The Completion Backward Principle.""

“The Completion Backward Principle,""  contained the hits, “Don't Want To Wait Anymore,"" “Sushi Girl,” and the classic rock staple “Talk To You Later.""  

Their next release on Capitol was ""Outside Inside,"" which featured the top 10 US single “She's A Beauty.""  

In 1985 The Tubes released “Love Bomb,"" which was not a commercial success and years of expensive tours left the band a half million dollars in debt.  Capitol dropped the Tubes and lead singer Fee Waybill left the band, with David Killngsworth joining as his replacement.  

The years that followed saw several personnel changes in the band, with Spooner, Cotten and Welnick all departed by mid-1989, and Waybill ultimately returning to the band in the 1990's.  While the Tubes have continued to release music, the fame and notoriety of the late 70's and early 80's remain as the bands true legacy."

Originally comprised of [a138932] (vocals, guitar), [a152001] (bass, vocals), [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/729232-Brian-Duffy-2]Brian Duffy[/url] aka [a432127] (drums) and [a2442678] (keys); Wärmling left the band when he moved back to Sweden in 1975 and was replaced with [a257111]. The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Greenfield's keyboards. Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Cornwell.

Briefly, in 1977, the band would be billed as [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/654126-Celia-And-The-Mutations]the Mutations[/url], where they would be fronted by vocalist [a314007]. This only lasted [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/274057-Celia-And-The-Mutations-Mony-Mony]one single[/url]; by the time the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/372625-Celia-The-Mutations-You-Better-Believe-Me]second single[/url] had released, only Burnel was still in the Mutations, featuring only on the A-side.

On the 3rd and 4th of April 1980, gigs were scheduled before Hugh was arrested on drug charges; [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/356312-The-Stranglers-And-Friends-Live-In-Concert]the gigs went ahead[/url] under the banner of [a8225560], featuring guest performers in place of Hugh.

Cornwell left in 1990 to pursue a solo career, being replaced by [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/809138-Paul-Roberts-6]Paul Roberts[/url] on vocals and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/257124-John-Ellis-2]John Ellis[/url] on guitar. During live gigs in this era, Roberts sung tracks traditionally performed by Burnel. For a 1993 tour, including the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/25623712-The-Stranglers-Live-At-Fontwell-Park-1993]Fontwell Park gig[/url], Jet was ill and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/12308956-Tim-Bruce-5]Tim Bruce[/url] filled in on drums.

Ellis left the band in 2000, passing the reins to guitarist [a629600]; when Roberts left the group in 2006 over disagreements during the recording of Suite XVI, Warne was promoted to lead vocalist also, rerecording the tracks already recorded by Roberts alongside Burnel.

Jet Black started experiencing health issues in 2007 that caused him to miss gigs; technician [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4478856-Ian-Barnard-2]Ian Barnard[/url] played in such instances. Black's live role was lessened in the 2013 tour, with [a4000000] playing the first halves of UK gigs and solely playing US gigs. Black played no gigs following March 2015, officially retiring in 2018; Macaulay's role as Black's replacement was officiated in 2016.

After contracting COVID-19 in hospital, Dave Greenfield died on the 3rd of May 2020. Following the release of Dark Matters, [a568270] became the band's new keyboardist for their final full tour in 2021-2022. Following his own poor health, Jet Black died on the 6th of December 2022."

1216628.0,0,3642829,UK,Jon Gomm,Hypertension,2003,57.47,11,['Album'],"['Rock', 'Pop']",['Acoustic'],"Jon Gomm is an acoustic singer-songwriter with an incredible virtuoso guitar style, where he uses one acoustic guitar to create drum sounds, basslines and sparkling melodies all at the same time, and combining styles from blues and jazz to rock and pop. The emphasis is still on the soulful vocals and songwriting however, and his original material is influenced by everything from Robert Johnson to Radiohead.

Jon first laid his hands on a guitar at the age of two (actually it was a ukulele - his parents couldn’t find a guitar small enough). He started taking classical guitar lessons, wrote his first song at the age of six, and at twelve he was accompanying his father, a music critic, to blues gigs in his hometown of Blackpool. Touring musicians would often stay at the Gomm household on the understanding Jon would get a guitar lesson, meaning he had one-to-one instruction from such legends as Walter Trout, Bob Brozman, Sherman Robertson and Norman Beaker (Jack Bruce band).

On leaving school Jon turned down a place at Oxford University to attend The Guitar Institute in London. While there he paid his way through college playing jazz in café-bars, recording as a session guitarist, and even playing Country & Western in working mens clubs for line-dancers.

Eventually he heard the call of the north and moved to Leeds, where he is now based, to study on the Jazz degree course at the music college there. He decided to try his hand at performing solo, and discovered all kinds of new sounds he could make with an acoustic guitar – hitting the surface of it to make snare drum, bass drum and bongo sounds, re-tuning the strings to get bass sounds, and teasing high harmonics from the guitar for synthesizer-like effects. He worked all these techniques into his own songs, and put his years of singing blues into use.

Nowadays he tours Europe, playing at festivals from Rome to Athens, has a huge cult following and is regarded by those in the know as one of the world’s most talented and innovative acoustic guitarists. Even with only one CD so far released he is already cited as an influence by many other performers. His videos are watched thousands of times within days of appearing on Youtube, and his home-recorded CD “Hypertension” has sold over ten thousand copies with no industry backing.

Formed in a squat in Leeds, England, in 1982, Chumbawamba released their first single, ""Revolution"", in 1985. Up to a point they self-released most of their material on labels they ran themselves, such as [l74128] and [l22496]. Their musical style has changed through the years, initially a shouting punk band, later recording some folk songs, then, with the ""Jesus H Christ"" album, they discovered electronic music. 

That album, however, was built around numerous samples of other groups and, when they found out how much clearing them would cost, they scrapped it (though, it was released as a bootleg and, in recent years, via their chumbawamba.tv site as mp3s) and rerecorded the album without the samples and with a new focus on censorship. 

""Anarchy"" was their response to criticism from their contemporaries for their move into pop music, funny, political and musically experimental. The anti-Nazi song ""Enough is Enough"", recorded with regular collaborator MC Fusion, was released as a single and launched Fusion's new group Credit to the Nation. They had minor chart success, but nothing compared to what was to come. 

The disappointing ""Swingin' with Raymond"" followed and was the end of their relationship with One Little Indian. Deciding that there's no such thing as a good capitalist, big or small, they signed with EMI, whom they had criticised in the past. The band were heavily criticised once again, but the massive worldwide success of ""Tubthumper"" allowed the band to fund numerous political campaigns around the world. 

They were never to repeat the success of that single and proudly proclaimed themselves one hit wonders and their relationship with EMI only lasted one more album and a few singles. Independent again with Mutt Records, and with long-time producer Neil Ferguson now officially a member, they have continued to experiment with their style, recording ""Readymades"", mixing folk samples with dance beats, the soundtrack to the Alex Cox film ""Revengers Tragedy"" and their latest release, ""UN"", recorded on a mini disc in Latin America and at Chumbawamba's Bradford studio, mixing styles and sounds from different parts of the world.

Since then, the group slimmed down to just Lou, Neil, Boff and Jude, and added Phil Moody on accordion to play folk music with pop influences. The other members have moved on to their own projects.  

Always controversial, often under attack from the left and the right, Chumbawamba have always done things their own way and, in their own words, ""Never do what you are told."" 

In August 2012 the band decided to call it quits after some final gigs in their 30th year of existence mainly because ""the rest of our lives got in the way and we couldn’t commit the time and enthusiasm that the band demanded.""

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.

Formed in 1998 by Neil Jones and Neil Sheasby, the band started with a deep love for Northern soul and Motown, which led them to create a sound that pays homage to their influences while carving out their unique voice in modern soul. With a tight rhythm section, brass-heavy arrangements, and rich vocal harmonies, Stone Foundation quickly gained a reputation for their electrifying live performances. Their early albums, like To Find the Spirit, laid the groundwork for a growing fan base and industry respect, setting them apart as torchbearers of authentic British soul.
In recent years, Stone Foundation has collaborated with a range of prominent musicians, most notably Paul Weller, who has contributed to and produced several of their tracks. Albums such as Street Rituals and Everybody, Anyone showcase the band’s evolving sound, blending socially aware themes with a soulful optimism that resonates with audiences across generations. With each release, Stone Foundation continues to expand their influence, merging classic soul textures with modern sensibilities and solidifying their place in the UK’s contemporary music landscape.
 Stone Foundation’s consistent charting success reflects a growing fanbase and a respected reputation within the British soul and R&B scenes, demonstrating their dedication to producing music that resonates both sonically and socially. (From wipeoutmusic.com)"

The band was formed in Colchester in December 1989 as [a=Seymour] but was renamed Blur in March 1990, after they'd signed for the Food label. Blur's early releases (the Leisure album and the singles off it) were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of ""baggy"" bands from the Madchester scene and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, at times reminding of Syd Barrett. Tthis was more readily apparent on several single B-sides where the group let loose a darker side.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music (e.g. The Kinks or XTC) or even nostalgic music from World War II. Their 2nd album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) had moderate success but began attracting attention for its Britishness but in hindsight it rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, with groups like [a=Suede] early frontrunners too. In 1994 Blur released what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album: Parklife. 1995's The Great Escape was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. 

When the 5th studio album Blur came out in 1997, the group had reinvented their sound. They severed ties from Britpop and reincorporated the art rock experimentalism of their early years, only this time the music was informed by a broader range of influences (e.g. Pavement). The album's second song Song 2 was released as a single and became a hit on alternative dancefloors. Subsequent albums 13 and Think Tank further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe.

After 13 and the subsequent tours, the band took a pause and its members pursued personal projects. In 1998 Albarn started the [a6378] project, Alex James engaged in [a120885] with Damien Hirst, and Graham Coxon released his first solo album the same year. Over the years Coxon had started struggling with alcoholism and when Blur started the recording sessions for Think Tank, it came to a point where they asked him to no longer be present. After its release in 2003 the band went on full hiatus until December 2008, when it was announced the band would reunite for concerts in London's Hyde Park (released as All The People) followed by a series of major concerts e.g. at Glastonbury 2009. The next year saw the release of a a documentary about the band ([url=https://www.discogs.com/master/898685-Blur-No-Distance-Left-To-Run]No Distance Left To Run[/url]) and of the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/241338-Blur-Fools-Day]Fool's Day[/url] single for RSD 2010.

In July 2012 a career spanning box set was released titled [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/460605-Blur-Blur-21-The-Box]Blur 21[/url], and in August 2012 the band headlined a show in Hyde Park for the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics (released as [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/500654-Blur-Parklive]Parklive[/url]). Earlier that year the band had tried to record a studio album with [a2728] as producer but that was aborted. In Autumn 2012 the band again paused its activities.

Early 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album: The Magic Whip. It had been created in 5 days in Hong Kong after a Japan tour that was cancelled in 2013. Following the Magic Whip tour the band went into hiatus again ... resurfacing in 2023 with their 9th studio album The Ballad Of Darren and a series of concerts. In April 2024 Albarn stated that their performance at Coachella was probably the band’s “last gig”. On 19 July 2024 a second documentary titled To The End opened in UK and Irish cinemas, as directed by Toby L.

They first disbanded in 1972 but reunited in the 1990s. Heron took the concept of rural folk a stage further by actually recording their first two albums in a field.

Heron's origin can be traced all the way to the Dolphin Folk Club in Maidenhead 1967, where [a1423289] (vocals), [a1423290] (guitar, vocals) and [a7997850] (guitar) first came together as a collective, inspired by [a59792] and the early [a266538].

By 1968, Collins was out of the picture but with the addition of fellow local folk club habitués Gerald Thomas ""G.T."" Moore (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and [a277390] (guitar), the band settled down to become Heron. They signed to Pye's progressive sublabel Dawn and released 2 albums, a single and an EP on the label. Disagreements in the band led to the band splitting in 1972.

They started back in the 1990s, establishing [l204939] in the process. In 2008, [a4375827] joined in (vocals, guitar, mandolin, percussion). In 2020 Tony Pook died, leaving things open re: the future of the band."

One of the pioneers of the progressive rock genre. The first official rehearsal of the band was on January 13, 1969. The first line-up comprised guitarist [a=Robert Fripp], lyricist and lighting man [a=Peter Sinfield] (who “invented” the name of the band), composer and multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian McDonald], bassist and vocalist [a=Greg Lake], and drummer [a=Michael Giles]. They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson. This line-up remained intact until summer 1984, releasing three studio albums.

Ten years later (May 1994), King Crimson started rehearsing again, this time as a ""double trio"" including [a=Pat Mastelotto] on drums and percussion and [a=Trey Gunn] on Stick in addition to the 1980s line-up; it released two full albums and a handful of EPs through Fripp's own [l=Discipline Global Mobile] label. A process of “fractalization” led to the creation of multiple spin-off groups containing three or four King Crimson members, dubbed ""ProjeKcts"" [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+One]One[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Two]Two[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/ProjeKct+Three]Three[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+Four]Four[/url], and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Projekct+X]X[/url], which released live and studio sessions through DGM. Having regained the rights to the full King Crimson catalogue, DGM put out numerous other recordings from all periods of the band's existence, including ""King Crimson Collectors' Club"" bi-monthly releases available only to members of the label's website. In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. Its first complete studio album was “The ConstruKction of Light” (May 2000), and the line-up carried on until the end of 2003. Since then, Tony Levin rejoined the group and Trey Gunn departed. In 2008, with the addition of [a=Gavin Harrison] the new King Crimson began and performed a 40th Anniversary Tour.

Robert Fripp stated in an August 2012 interview that he had retired from the music business, but 2014 found a new King Crimson line-up touring, including Fripp (guitar), Mel Collins (saxophones, flute), Tony Levin (basses, stick), Pat Mastelotto (drums, percussion), Gavin Harrison (drums, percussion), [a=Jakko M. Jakszyk] (vocals, guitar, flute), and [a=William Rieflin] (drums, percussion, synthesizer). In 2016 [a=Jeremy Stacey] (drums, keyboards) joined as an eighth member making the group a ""double quartet"".

The band toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Levin and Jakszyk had earlier said that the North America tour was probably the band's last there."

Born: 25 May 1958 in Sheerwater (Near Woking), Surrey, England, UK. 

English singer, songwriter, and previous leader of two bands: [a=The Jam] and [a=The Style Council]. In England, he is recognised as something of a national institution yet, because much of his songwriting is rooted in English culture, he has remained essentially a national rather than an international star. 

He was a central figure in the Mod revival. As the leader of [a=The Jam] he fronted the most popular British band of the punk era, influencing legions of English rockers that ranged from his mod-revival contemporaries to [a=Smiths] in the 1980s and [a=Oasis (2)] in the 1990s. 

During the final days of The Jam he developed a fascination with [l=Motown] and soul music, which led him to form the sophisti-pop group [a=The Style Council] in 1983. As The Style Council’s career progressed, Weller’s interest in soul moved towards an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which led to the gradual erosion of his audience and the eventual split of The Style Council in 1990.

Weller launched his solo career in 1992 and by the mid 1990s, he had released three successful albums which were both critically acclaimed and massively popular in England. 

Then contemporary bands like [a=Ocean Colour Scene] were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad-rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans that had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career.

Son of [a=John Weller (2)]. He married [a=Dee C. Lee] in 1987; divorced in 1998. Father of [a=Leah Weller] and [a10310152] (with Dee C. Lee). He became involved with [a=Samantha Stocks] until 2008. He married [a=Hannah Andrews] in September 2010."

Next the band signed to [l8377] and released the album [m=90563] in September 1985, which hit number one in the College Radio/Alternative charts for four weeks. After a spring tour the band released [m=90564] in early summer 1987. Produced by [a241495], the album produced the hit single “[m=389736]”.

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years.

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll.

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.

Soon, Psychic TV became a post-industrial supergroup, expanding the core line-up with the talents of frequent collaborators [a=Monte Cazazza], [a=David Tibet], and [a=John Balance], which led to the classic 1983 album ""[m=17374]."" 

After Peter and John's departure in January 1984 to concentrate on their [a=Coil] project, Psychic TV's style evolved more in the direction of psychedelic or acid rock, then called ""hyperdelic,"" rock by the band, a style they would return to in later years. In 1987, [a=Alex Fergusson] departed, and a move back to more electronic based music took place, initally featuring the talents of [a=Richard Norris] and [a=Dave Ball], and then [a=Fred Giannelli], [a=Greedy Beat Syndicate], and [a=Richard Schiessl]. Psychic TV were found at the forefront of acid house with the fake compilations ""[m=17878],"" ""[m=76308],"" and various releases featuring rotating line-ups under different monikers ([a=Mistress Mix], [a=Sickmob], & [a=DJ Doktor Megatrip]).

Well documented constant touring and recording took its toll. A relocation to the USA in 1993, the closure of the band's independent label [l=Temple Records] in 1994, and perhaps most prominently the separation from [a=Paula P-Orridge] left Genesis P. Orridge to be the only permanent member of Psychic TV. The name ""Psychic TV & Genesis P-Orridge,"" was used for a number of Psychic TV re-releases and experimental projects by Genesis P-Orridge and [a=Larry Thrasher], before Genesis formed [a=Thee Majesty] with [a=Bryin Dall]. A final concert was announced and held at the Royal Festival Hall, London in May 1999. 

In 2003, Genesis P. Orridge (now Breyer P. Orridge) toured with a new line up as PTV3, musically leaning towards the ""hyperdelic,"" phase. Silently, they restarted the once dismissed TOPY and re-activated the dormant Temple Records for a batch of new and old releases.

Albums such as Street Rituals and Everybody, Anyone showcase the band’s evolving sound, blending socially aware themes with a soulful optimism that resonates with audiences across generations. With each release, Stone Foundation continues to expand their influence, merging classic soul textures with modern sensibilities and solidifying their place in the UK’s contemporary music landscape.

Influenced by industrial, punk and metal they started experimenting and fusing the styles together. The band set out gigging extensively around the UK and releasing numerous tape releases. In 1992 the band temporarily changed there name to Skinflick Productions, releasing two 7"" records 'Pretty Dead Girl' and 'Pig Sick' plus further tape and cd releases.
In 1995 the original members parted ways and J. Williams continued back under the name of Skinflick. The first major release was the 'Two Ton Loser' EP which was released on March 10th 2003 on the ZERO TOLERANCE label, a side label of COLD SPRING, the UKs largest Industrial / Ambient label. The side-label was virtually formed on the strength of their demo.
A CD entitled ‘Pearls before Swine’, which features a heavier industrial rock sound to previous releases, was released in promo format in 2004, plans are to remaster and re-release sometime soon.
A live band was put together and they spent between 2002 - 2005 constantly touring across the U.K. receiving excellent reviews and building a strong fan base. The summer of 2004 saw them playing at the Wave Gotik Treffen festival in Germany and the U.K. Infest 2004 festival.
After many shows together, the original live line up called it a day and in 2005 a new line-up was formed, that concentrated on even more electronic insanity and gut throbbing bass and beats.
While searching for a new home to release on Skinflick decided to tarnish the good name of of a certain pop star with a cover of 'Toxic', released as download only its now hit somewhere in the 10,000 download mark and has received various radio and club play around the world.
With new label Dead Sexy Records came a new six track e.p. 'Year of the Dogs' which was released in June 2005 and concentrates on a much more industrial-metal sound.
After seven years of writing, rewrites, mental breakdowns, screaming and blood on the highway, the next album 'Halo of Flies / The Maggot Circle' was finished. 
The original CD double album features CD1 'Halo of Flies' thirteen tracks of dark brooding atmospheric and jagged metal bursts. CD2 'The Maggot Circle' is a collection of remixes of the album by artists such as Mantra, Zintek, Scott Lamb (Deathboy) and many others.

Grand Funk Railroad (also known as Grand Funk) is an American rock band that was highly popular during the 1970s. Grand Funk Railroad toured constantly to packed arenas worldwide. David Fricke of Rolling Stone Magazine writes ""You cannot talk about rock in the 1970s without talking about GRAND FUNK RAILROAD!""  The band's name is a play on words of the Grand Trunk and Western Railroad, a railroad line that ran through the band's home town of Flint, Michigan."

For many years down in his cellar, Jeff played that boogie-woogie fast and slow, and performed long Gene Krupa / Cozy Cole style solos on his drums. During 1956 and 1957 he bought every single rock & roll, rockabilly and rhythm & blues record he could afford.

Based in Northampton, Massachusetts, Jeff played in various recording bands for 12 years (including Al Anderson's Wildweeds) before writing, singing and performing his own songs, mostly in the 50's rock & roll style. He fronted two bands, The Contenders, then later Jeff Potter & The Rhythm Agents. He also plays the piano with New York rockabillys The Lustre Kings.

From 1998 to 2002 Jeff and Betsy-Dawn Williams played in a band called American Roadhouse together featuring a mix of rock & roll, R&B and rockabilly. In 2003 he played at the Rockin' Fifties Fest in Green Bay, Wisconsin, with The Lustre Kings. His recordings have been released by Nervous, Fury, Dynamite and Raucous Records. Jeff still plays his drums in the cellar.

The album ""Rhythm Riot"" is really incredible, it has the ingredients of many styles of American roots music, ranging from boogie woogie to rock 'n' roll to rockabilly to rhythm & blues. A magician on the piano, a wizzard on the drums and a good songwriter as well, all songs are self-penned originals. The album hits off with a steady boogie woogie rhythm on a song titled ""Don't Stop Now"", switching to rockabilly on ""The Party"" with great piano and guitar breaks (think Freddy 'Fingers' Lee).

The best is yet to come, the title song ""Rhythm Riot"" is something else. Pounding drums (Sandy Nelson style), complete with solo, and a twangy guitar (Duane Eddy style), this is a Jeff Potter original that will raise the hairs in your neck. As easy as pie, Jeff switches over to the blues on the touchy ""How Come"", and back to rock 'n' roll on ""I Don't Wanna Go"". The album is packed with American roots music with a lot of variety, energy and skill. You just gotta love it. At the end of the CD there's also a hidden bluesy track which sounds a bit like a John Lee Hooker jam session."

They had recorded a couple of tracks with Bob on guitar. 

After the band folded, this is what the members were doing in 2008:
Krzys (Fijalkowski, guitar) teaches Art History at Norwich School of Art and The University of East Anglia. He sometimes does visiting lectures at the Tate Modern — he’s a Doctor of Surrealism. Bob (Brown, bass) is a graphic designer in London and plays in a band called Shrag. Chris Parsons (drums) is a gardener and plays with Milk and Honey Band, and also drums for Astrid Williamson. Simon Dunford is a press officer for University of East Anglia. Matt Sigley (keyboards) went back to Australia and plays for various bands — including his own Daytime Frequency project and The Lovetones.

In 1984, after being asked to leave, he formed his own personal project, called [a=Above The Ruins].

He came back in 1987 with Sol Invictus, involving [a=Ian Read] and shortly later [a=Karl Blake] of [a=Lemon Kittens] and [a=Shock Headed Peters]. The music of Sol Invictus on the first recordings was a mixture of acoustic and electronic sounds, creating some epic and dramatic songs which stand against the decadence of the West and of modern society. This sound characterizes the first three albums, ""Against The Modern World"" (1988), ""In The Jaws Of The Serpent"" (1989) and ""Lex Talionis"" (1990). In 1991 Ian Read left the band to form [a=Fire + Ice], and Wakeford took the sound of Sol Invictus progressively more towards a dark folk approach, hiring new musicians, such as violinist [a=Matt Howden] and singer and instrumentist [a=Sally Doherty].

Attracted to the continually changing Drum & Bass Electonica scene and with the decline in clubs and live venues for Rock music in London he decided to create a hybrid of rock and hard dance beats. . ""I want to bring back the hooks and melodies that made Rock so accessible in the 80's and have the excitement of the club culture combined to make a new sound to make a crossover band that appeals to more than one audience""

Utilizing a love for melody and song structure combined with a skewed lyrical gift Astrop points to inspiration from such diverse musical giants as The Police, Soundgarden, and Tom Waits. Bringing these elements together with an eclectic collection of strings, synth and aggressive dance beats has contributed to creating Alien Breed's unique sound. The Breed believes that their musical quest will help break the mold of generic, angst posturing, rap rock formula and take the music to a higher level of showmanship and craft.

Armed with a 4 track demo and a vision, Ben started exposing his sound to radio stations and labels across the U.K., simultaneously, he decided to put a band together

First choice was Matt Bayne a Drummer from Leeds relocated to London and had played across Europe in Acid Jazz and D&B bands. Matt has a unique understanding of dance beats and brings a well-schooled drumming technique to the band mixing up programmed and live beats.

Then came Ed Pepper on Bass, he had also moved to London and played the UK circuit many times before joining The Breed. With a flamboyant style, and healthy appetite for Block Rockin' beats, Pepper is constantly chewing up the bottom end of the Breed's sound. With manic, elastic like moves, and an extra terrestrial look, one might suspect where the Alien part came from.

While the band was rehearsing in London, LA based label Delicious Vinyl founder Michael Ross heard their demo through a friend of a friend. Though he was in London working with a different band, he immediately stopped what he was doing to meet the band. ""I was completely floored by the combination of drum and bass rhythms with the monster rock riffs. It was the next level for me, bombastic, melodic, ripping beats and pure rock all in one."" With Ross's encouragement the band decided to split the London scene and come to LA to pursue their musical fortune's signing with Delicious Vinyl.

The Breed have spent the past two years fine tuning their progressive sonic assault on the Sunset Strip and in the studio, and are now poised with their first single ""Colorblind"", to take it to the next level. Get ready for the ride, it's gonna be a wild one!"

Born in Washington, D.C., on January 4, 1947, but raised in England, Cutler began drumming in beat and psychedelic groups around 1966. His first group, Louise, played the clubs in London's psychedelic scene until disbanding three years later. With [a=Dave Stewart], then-keyboardist of the band [a=Egg (2)], Cutler formed the 26-piece Ottawa Music Company, which played seven gigs in all, highlighting the music of composers that they knew or had met.

Chris Cutler then joined Henry Cow in 1971 after he placed an ad in the paper, and for seven long years they recorded and toured, by themselves or in collaboration with members of [a=Slapp Happy]. Cutler also played with psychedelic band [a=Gong]; the London Philharmonic and the Berlin Radio Orchestra. Henry Cow broke up in 1978, just after the setting up of Rock in Opposition, a collective of similar thinking musicians. Since then Cutler has formed several groups for one or two albums apiece, including [a=Cassiber], [a=the (EC) Nudes], [a=P53] or [a=The Science Group] to name only a few, and collaborated with a long list of progressive, avant garde, improvisors and experimental musicians, such as the [a=Residents], [a=Pere Ubu], [a=Hail], [a=Biota], [a=Telectu], and many, many more.

Politics were always important to Cutler and to Henry Cow who were looking for radical social change. Such drive is seen in his lyrics for Henry Cow and for subsequent Cow and Slapp Happy related bands, such as [a=Art Bears] and [a=News From Babel], and in other later collaborations. Cutler's lyrics often tell metaphorical political tales using imagery from medieval English texts. 

Cutler also founded and runs [l=ReR Megacorp], which releases a majority of the work he either initiates or performs on. In 1984, he published ""File Under Popular"" a series of essays about experimental musicians and the theories of creating music against the mainstream."

British composer, improviser and multi-instrumentalist, who has situated himself for more than thirty years in the area where rock music and new music meet. 

Played in R & B groups at school and did solo folk club work from 1967-1969. Began exploratory musical activities with [a292451] early in 1968 which led to the start [a282968].
Between times since then he has been involved with flautist [a147699] in the Ritual Theatre, played guitar in Brecht-Weill productions, taught guitar and ran a jazz workshop at Cambridge tech.

Co-founder of the British underground band ""Henry Cow"" (1968-78), Frith moved to New York in the late seventies and came into contact with many of the musicians with whom he’s since been associated, for example; John Zorn; Ikue Mori; Tom Cora; Zeena Parkins and Bob Ostertag. Fourteen years in New York gave rise to groups like ""Massacre"" (with Bill Laswell and Fred Maher), ""Skeleton Crew"" (with Tom and Zeena), and ""Keep the Dog"", a sextet performing an extensive repertoire of Frith compositions.

In the eighties Frith began writing for dance, film, and theatre. This, in turn, led to his composing for ""Rova Sax Quartet"", ""Ensemble Modern"", ""Asko Ensemble"" and a number of other groups, including his own critically acclaimed ""Guitar Quartet"".

Best known world-wide as an improvisational guitarist, Frith has also performed in a variety of other contexts, playing bass in John Zorn’s ""Naked City"", violin in Lars Hollmer’s ""Looping Home Orchestra"" and guitar on recordings ranging from ""The Residents"" and René Lussier, to Brian Eno and Amy Denio. Frith was also the subject of Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzels’ award-winning documentary film ""Step Across The Border"". 

He became Professor of Composition at Mills College in Oakland, California, near his home with photographer [a498358] and their children, Finn and Lucia.

This was followed with a session largely comprising of new material for French radio, but soon the band realised that they found the neo-folk genre too restricting and so these songs where largely scrapped in favor of a new direction, which can be heard on the ""Many Hands Should Throw Stones"" album.

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

Ann Matthews and Alan Holmes were previously members of Welsh language post-punk band Fflaps between 1987 and 1993, touring Europe, releasing three LPs, and recording two John Peel Sessions during that time. When the band's drummer Jonny Evans left in 1993, they recruited old friend Maeyc Hewitt and morphed into the quite different sounding Ectogram.

The band initially recorded two singles for the small Welsh independent label, Atol, before being signed to the more well-known Ankst label, for whom they recorded an album and two EPs. When that label dissolved in 1998, Ectogram stayed with Ankstmusik, the label set up by one of the former Ankst partners.

Their music combines conventional rock elements such as repetitive rhythms and vocal melody with atonal discord and improvisation. Their style has been influenced by bands such as Sonic Youth, Faust, Pere Ubu, My Bloody Valentine and Acid Mothers Temple.

All three members of Ectogram were also members of the experimental rock supergroup The Serpents, who released an album on the Ochre label in 1999.

During 2005, Ectogram played a series of gigs with krautrock group Faust, at times joining them on stage for a collaborative performance, and in 2012 they acted as a backing band for a performance by ex - Can member Damo Suzuki.

Drummer Maeyc Hewitt died of cancer 2 October 2015 and the band's website suggested that this was possibly the end of Ectogram as a band."

In 2005 ANT collaborated once again with Hefner band-mate Darren Hayman, providing acoustic guitar, backing vocals and percussion on the track The Light In Her Room on Darren's solo EP Cortinaland.

Today ANT lives in Malmö, Sweden, and his second solo album, Footprints Through the Snow was released in March 2006 on Homesleep Records. ANT also recorded a 4 song session for BBC6's Tom Robinson show in March 2006.

ANT released a new 6 song mini album on cult Spanish label Acuarela Discos in February 2009 featuring Darren Hayman and Jack Hayter of Hefner and James Milne and Tjinder Singh of Cornershop.

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

The group has no permanent group line-up, and Johnson has collaborated with a wide range of musicians, changing personnel from project to project.
The The began recording in 1979/1980 and released their first single “Controversial Subject” in 1980. The first album release came in 1983, the critically acclaimed “Soul Mining"", which featured guest appearances from [a=Orange Juice (3)] drummer [a=Zeke Manyika], [a=Jools Holland], [a=Thomas Leer] and [a15025].
Johnson followed with a new album entitled “Infected” in 1986, recording again with Zeke Manyika, plus singer [a=Neneh Cherry], and a number of session musicians. Four singles were released from the album, with ""Heartland"" being the most successful, reaching 29 in the UK Chart. The album was accompanied by a full length video “Infected: The Movie” which was shot on location in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Johnson toured the world extensively with the movie. 
In 1988, Johnson re-formed The The as a four piece band, having recruited ex-[a=The Smiths] guitarist [a=Johnny Marr], bassist [a=James Eller] and former [a=ABC] drummer [a=David Palmer] as full time band members. This line-up recorded the album “Mind Bomb”, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and featured the band's highest charting single to that time, ""The Beat(en) Generation"" hitting 18 in the UK chart.
In 1989 keyboard player [a=D.C. Collard] was added to the line-up and the band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called “The The Versus The World”, culminating in three sold out gigs at London's Royal Albert Hall at the end of the tour. 
In 1990 the studio EP “Shades of Blue” was released. 
In 1993, the five-piece line-up (Johnson/Marr/Collard/Eller/Palmer) recorded The The’s fourth album “Dusk”, which debuted at No. 2 in the UK. Another world tour followed, the “Lonely Planet” tour. Johnson relocated the band to America, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by guitarist [a=Keith Joyner] and bassist [a=Jared Michael Nickerson]. Harmonica player [a=Jim Fitting] (formerly of [a=Treat Her Right]) joined the band in early 1993. Palmer left the band partway through the tour and was replaced by ex-[a=Stabbing Westward] drummer [a=Andy Kubiszewski]. The reshuffled band headlined the main stage at the 1993 Reading Festival.
Johnson then permanently relocated to New York, and The The's next project was 1995's “Hanky Panky”, an album that consisted entirely of [a=Hank Williams] cover versions. “Hanky Panky” was recorded by a new The The group, this time consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, guitarist [a=Eric Schermerhorn], bass guitarist [a=Gail Ann Dorsey], and drummer [a=Brian MacLeod]. Their cover version of ""I Saw The Light"" hit No. 31 in the UK chart.
In 2000, The The, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, bassist [a=Spencer Campbell] and drummer [a=Earl Harvin], released its sixth album “NakedSelf” and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour, “The Naked Tour”, lasting 14 months. “NakedSelf” remains The The's final released studio album to date.
Since 2003 the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations.
In April 2014 The The announced that on June 30th 2014 a re-mastered, re-packaged version of ""Soul Mining"" would be released to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of its original release.

Pete Christie is a nationally touring solo British singer-songwriter / acoustic fingerstyle guitarist who plays from the heart and sings from the soul – a must see for anyone who loves acoustic music.
“Intense, passionate vocals and a clear grasp of how to write a great song – mesmerising….”
Pete Christie has been compared to many acclaimed musicians from Martin Simpson to Paul Weller, and was recently described as being “a cross between Pete Townsend, Mark Knopfler and Richard Thompson, but with a great voice; though, until now, without the fame !!!”
Pete Christie has developed his own original powerful style of acoustic fingerstyle guitar technique. His songs, and importantly, his lyrics are original English and contemporised anglicana roots, with a mix of rock, folk and country. His individualistic fingerstyle guitar technique can coax anything from achingly beautiful simple, sparse, and haunting accompaniment, to an explosive, almost neo-flamenco rhythm. It’s as if Pete “duets” with the guitar rather than just casually strums it, and he has perfected the art of making it sound like there has got to be more than just one musician on stage.
Over his 40 years as a performing musician, Pete has been frontman in a three-piece rock band, a professional songwriter, a recording sessions singer, and has been a guest with a diverse array of guitarists and musicians such as:
 Jackie Leven, Nick Harper, Jeff Lang, Glenn Tillbrook, Ezio, Ruby Turner, Hugh Cornwell, Bob Brozman, Martin Harley, Matt Andersen, Ben Montague, Kieran Halpin, Ron Trueman-Border, Steve Tilston, Rory Ellis, Dave Pegg, and frequently with Derrin Nauendorf.
Pete is based on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset in southern UK and is touring with his latest studio album ‘Frank’, which shows off his gift for tethering his romantic ruminations to memorable melodies and instrumental harmonies. The album has been called “refreshing”, “honest”, “wonderful”, “a great British singer songwriter”, “natural”, “versatile”, “…heartfelt songs that recall McTell’s glory days…”, and “delivered by a master craftsman”. “Frank is not background music. It’s a wonderfully written book brought to life by sounds”.
“Waiting in the Wings” one of Pete’s most frequently requested songs, is, according to Minor 7th in the USA: “….reminiscent of the off-the-wall stuff of Brian Wilson and Sir Paul as produced by Sir George Martin.”
In 2011, Pete joined forces with the UK Roots Movement alongside Wille and the Bandits, Alex Roberts, Rory Ellis, Andy Grant, The Wishbones, and Hip Route. Artists of integrity who share the true philosophy of the troubadour and offer promoters and proprietors a stable of artists of proven quality and reliability. Occasionally we even get to perform together, like at UK Roots Movement Folk On The Quay festival in 2013

 
In 2013, Pete Christie, Nicky Swann and Jinder came together to form Westcountry Songwriters Circle. Three accomplished and distinctive singer songwriters, on stage in a brand-new collaboration, add the audience, and the magic commences. We take the BBC4 Songwriters Circle format to a whole new level. Music performance is our passion and inspiration. We do it, to do it. We are always on tour and yes, we make a living. After years of honing our songs, practicing for hours, and reflecting upon how they work in a concert environment, our music now appeals on a variety of levels – intellectual, emotional and spiritual, with a good balance between familiarity and variety. Live music can give the audience moments beyond the price tag. We take the audience on a journey through lyrics and melodies. It is all about the audience and crowd interaction, being comfortable and spontaneous onstage and an exceptionally high quality of sound. The signature song for Westcountry Songwriters Circle is ’Westcountry Love Song’, with three-part vocal harmony, melodies and a capella performed at our first event together for Kontra Roots at Finedon Community Centre, in Northampton.
Pete Christie is passionate about his handmade guitars and the quality of sound he produces, and is proud to be a “Featured Artist” for Avalon Guitars.

Brothers Hugh (vocals, rhythm) and Norm (drums) had previously played in a mod rock band called The Cinnamon Firm which had recently broke up after several line up changes. The Firm were a popular live act in Ireland and had enjoyed a few local tv appearances and attracted interest from a couple of major record labels. At the same time Norm was also playing drums for a loud dirty garage rock and roll band called Thee Dreggs. Thee Dreggs vocalist and rhythm guitarist had recently left the band to set up home in Belgium. The members of the Cinnamon Firm and Thee Dreggs had been friends for years so it seemed like a natural solution to invite Hugh to get together with remaining Dreggs - Bobby (lead guitar), Will (Bass, Vocals) and Norm to form a new band. The merger brought Hugh's mod songwriting sensibilities together with raw rootsy garage band ethics. The new band was called THE KEEPERS. They managed to retain the essence and power of their old bands but with an added dynamic that gives them their own distinct brand of Belfast beat. it wasn't long before they had written a handful of songs. They recorded the tracks straight away while they were still fresh and vibrant to their ears, a philosophy they have continued through all their recordings. On May 24th of that year, the band played their first gig to a great response in front of 200 people at Belfast's Limelight club and have since been playing regularly around Northern Ireland and other places such as England, Rep of Ireland, Isle of Man, Holland, Belgium and Germany.

Their sound is ingrained with elements of garage rock, RandB, mod and punk but refuses to be pigeon-holed into any of these genres. The music is like a hit from an injected drug - instant, colourful, direct, loud, highly addictive rock 'n' roll that will mainline straight to your soul. Sick and tired of an endless slew of pop and shoe-gazing indie bands the Keepers are hitting back with raw ballsy rockin' tunes, Big ol' hairy monkey balls baby! But this is not protest music. These boys don't waste time protesting, this is DIRECT ACTION!

The Keepers' set is comprised mostly of well-crafted original material with a helping of cool covers of some of their favourite songs. Their hair-raising live reputation helped them land a weekly residency and their own club night (Balloon Farm) in Belfast's Duke of York bar, a savvy mixture of live rock 'n' roll and hip vinyl sounds which they ran for several months.

Their first single - 'Stop Pretending' was released in early 2001 and is available on seven inch vinyl from Barcelona's Butterfly Records label. The band have also released a five track CD on Italy's AUA Records as well as two self-released CD albums. Tracks by the Keepers are also available on compilation albums from labels such As El Torro and No Action.

So there you have it, good 'ol rock 'n' roll is alive and well in Belfast and these boys are the keepers of the faith. So, seek ye The Keepers and prepare for heaven!! "

Independence and forward thinking have always been at the forefront of coL's work. In 2001, he founded the underground label: JesusWarhol Records. A year later, after shooting his first music video, he created: Factory 3 Films. Directing videos for Spookey Ruben, R. Stevie Moore, and Pikelet among others.

He has collaborated with various underground artists: OFFBEAT (with Aaron Embry), Atheif (with Ariel Pink), Colour Sons (with Doleful Lions) Tall Children (with Karoline Hausted), as well as working with Of Life and Richard Sax Ross as producer.

Starting off as a punk-pop band, the band discovered the music of The Jayhawks, The Byrds, Tom Petty and Wilco and their sound gradually matured into more of an alt-country style but without losing the upbeat, catchy melodies of their songs.

Since their self-titled and self-released debut album in 2001, Dropkick have released a further twelves albums and three EPs, had worldwide airplay (including BBC Radio 2, Radio Gothenburg and Onda Madrid), performed live on BBC Children In Need and toured in Spain five times, a country in which they have a significant cult following.

Their 2008 album “Dot The i” (originally released on their own Taylored Records label) was re-issued by Rock Indiana Records in Spain and Dropkick’s albums, ‘Patchwork’, ‘Abelay Hotel’, ‘Time Cuts The Ties’ and ‘Paper Trails’ were released between 2008 and 2012 on Swedish label Sound Asleep Records.

In 2014 Dropkick released two albums: “Homeward”, on Taylored Records and Bobo Integral in Spain, and ‘Good Vibes: The Dropkick Songbook Vol.1’, a retrospective collection of songs from between 2001-2008 released by Rock Indiana Records. These releases were supported with a massively successful tour of Spain and UK shows.

Dropkick’s line-up has changed many times over the years but in early 2015 the band, expanded to a five piece line up the previous year, welcomed Roy W Taylor back into the band after a four year break to replace founding member, Alastair Taylor.

Andrew Taylor – vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards

The name Radiohead comes from the [a=Talking Heads] song, ""Radio Head"", from the ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/master/39386]True Stories[/url]"" album.

Formed by school friends in 1985, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's ""[r=767600]"". The cathartic ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Creep/master/21481]Creep[/url]"", from the debut album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Pablo-Honey/master/13344]Pablo Honey[/url]"" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves.

Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]"" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]'s expressive singing. The album featured the hits ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High & Dry[/url]"", ""[r=1463625]"" and ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]"".

The band's third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]"" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990s, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]"" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.

""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]"" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]"" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]"", was released in May 2016.

The three of them got together, and after recruiting drummer Henry Spinetti, and singer Helen Caunt, they recorded their version. To the surprise of all concerned, the track was a hit in the U.S. charts and they quickly came under pressure to produce a follow-up, then an album. However, Caunt was deemed increasingly unsuitable and was replaced by Annie Kavanagh, who'd been lead in the London performance of 'Jesus Christ Superstar'. In early 1974, they hit the U.S. charts for a second time with 'Touch Me', but it was clear to Hurst that Atlantic weren't going to support the band, so he ""pulled out of the deal"".

in the summer of 1974, newly signed to Arista, and now with Les Binks on drums, they embarked on their U.S. tour. During this tour they supported several acts, including: [a153073], [a343684], and [a98528]. They continued touring, and in early 1975 they also supported [a39775] at the [l264367], in London.

The Brook Brothers started out as a skiffle group in 1956, and after winning a local talent show, changed their look and sound to approximate the style of The Everly Brothers.  They signed to Top Rank Records in 1960 and released a cover of the song ""Greenfields"" by The Brothers Four in 1960. The tune was a hit in Italy but attracted little notice in their home country. After a few more singles were released, they switched to Pye Records, and their second release, ""Warpaint"" (written by Howard Greenfield and Barry Mann), became a UK Top 5 hit. This song was also recorded by Bill Haley, among others.

Following the single's success they released a full-length album and toured with Cliff Richard and Bobby Rydell. They took part in the annual NME Readers' Poll-Winners Concert at London's Wembley Pool on 15 April 1962. They were produced by a young Tony Hatch, and made an appearance in the film, It's Trad, Dad. The Brook Brothers entered A Song For Europe for the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, but did not advance in the contest.

The group's popularity faded as The Beatles's sound became more popular, and they left public view by 1965. Their entire cache of Pye recordings was reissued on CD by Castle Music in the 1990s.

Originally comprised of [a138932] (vocals, guitar), [a152001] (bass, vocals), [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/729232-Brian-Duffy-2]Brian Duffy[/url] aka [a432127] (drums) and [a2442678] (keys); Wärmling left the band when he moved back to Sweden in 1975 and was replaced with [a257111]. The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Greenfield's keyboards. Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Cornwell.

Briefly, in 1977, the band would be billed as [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/654126-Celia-And-The-Mutations]the Mutations[/url], where they would be fronted by vocalist [a314007]. This only lasted [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/274057-Celia-And-The-Mutations-Mony-Mony]one single[/url]; by the time the [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/372625-Celia-The-Mutations-You-Better-Believe-Me]second single[/url] had released, only Burnel was still in the Mutations, featuring only on the A-side.

On the 3rd and 4th of April 1980, gigs were scheduled before Hugh was arrested on drug charges; [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/356312-The-Stranglers-And-Friends-Live-In-Concert]the gigs went ahead[/url] under the banner of [a8225560], featuring guest performers in place of Hugh.

Cornwell left in 1990 to pursue a solo career, being replaced by [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/809138-Paul-Roberts-6]Paul Roberts[/url] on vocals and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/257124-John-Ellis-2]John Ellis[/url] on guitar. During live gigs in this era, Roberts sung tracks traditionally performed by Burnel. For a 1993 tour, including the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/25623712-The-Stranglers-Live-At-Fontwell-Park-1993]Fontwell Park gig[/url], Jet was ill and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/12308956-Tim-Bruce-5]Tim Bruce[/url] filled in on drums.

Ellis left the band in 2000, passing the reins to guitarist [a629600]; when Roberts left the group in 2006 over disagreements during the recording of Suite XVI, Warne was promoted to lead vocalist also, rerecording the tracks already recorded by Roberts alongside Burnel.

Jet Black started experiencing health issues in 2007 that caused him to miss gigs; technician [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4478856-Ian-Barnard-2]Ian Barnard[/url] played in such instances. Black's live role was lessened in the 2013 tour, with [a4000000] playing the first halves of UK gigs and solely playing US gigs. Black played no gigs following March 2015, officially retiring in 2018; Macaulay's role as Black's replacement was officiated in 2016.

After contracting COVID-19 in hospital, Dave Greenfield died on the 3rd of May 2020. Following the release of Dark Matters, [a568270] became the band's new keyboardist for their final full tour in 2021-2022. Following his own poor health, Jet Black died on the 6th of December 2022."

The name Radiohead comes from the [a=Talking Heads] song, ""Radio Head"", from the ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/master/39386]True Stories[/url]"" album.

Formed by school friends in 1985, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's ""[r=767600]"". The cathartic ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Creep/master/21481]Creep[/url]"", from the debut album ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Pablo-Honey/master/13344]Pablo Honey[/url]"" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves.

Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]"" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]'s expressive singing. The album featured the hits ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High & Dry[/url]"", ""[r=1463625]"" and ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]"".

The band's third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]"" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990s, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]"" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.

""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]"" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]"" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]"", was released in May 2016.
 
Radiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Smiths,+The]The Smiths[/url], [a=Pixies], [a=Magazine], [a=Joy Division] and [a=Siouxsie & The Banshees], who Thom Yorke claims inspired him to become a performer, and [a=R.E.M.] (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, referring to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').

The band was formed in Birmingham, England in 1969 by guitarist John Perry (who died shortly after and was replaced by [a=Ernie Chataway]), bassist [a=Bruno Stapenhill], drummer [a=John Partridge (2)], and singer [a=Al Atkins], who created a band name from Bob Dylan's song '[i][r=3881740][/i]'. In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Drummers John Ellis and [a=Chris Campbell (30)] replaced Partridge. Later, in 1973, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Campbell, respectively. A song from the last show with Atkins and Campbell and three from Halford and Hinch's first were released in 2019 on the compilation [m=1794713]. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018. For the Firepower tour he was temporarily replaced by Andy Sneap, making Hill and Halford the only remaining members from the band's early era."

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

After Roxy Music's demise in 1983, MacKay moved to Ireland, developing a fondness for traditional Irish music. Wanting a respite from the studio, MacKay formed the Explorers with Manzanera and vocalist James Wraith. The Explorers started recording a year later, debuting with the snappy synth-pop track ""Lorelei"" in June 1984. On ""Lorelei,"" Manzanera and MacKay peeled away Roxy Music's lush, dreamy arrangements but retained their original band's funky grooves. The Explorers performed for BBC Radio One in December 1984, the group's first concert. In 1985, Virgin Records released the Explorers' self-titled LP; the band also toured the U.K. However, the Explorers couldn't sell records; the group began recording a second album at Gallery Studios in October 1985, but the band's lack of success had it shelved. The Explorers split up in 1986. In 1989, Manzanera's Expression Records issued the Explorers' second LP, Manzanera & MacKay; the album was credited to Manzanera & MacKay as well and not the Explorers. After the breakup of the Explorers, Manzanera and MacKay started solo careers.

Nevermore was formed after [a516458] and [a516456]'s previous band, [a864569], had disbanded. [a516457] went on to join Sanctuary as a touring guitarist just before they folded, and then formed Nevermore with Dane and Sheppard.

Nevermore ceased activity in 2011 after Loomis and Van Williams both departed following disputes with Sheppard and Dane. The latter two then returned to the recently reactivated Sanctuary on a full-time basis. Warrel Dane later stated that Nevermore was not definitively finished. This was contradicted in a September 2017 interview with Jeff Loomis, where he confirmed that the band was broken up, but simultaneously acknowledged that a future reunion would be possible since the band members were still on speaking terms with each other. 

In December 2024, Jeff Loomis and Van Williams teased a return of the band with yet-to-be-unveiled plans for 2025.

They were a musically adventurous group who first made an impact as a post-punk new wave band but refused to be pigeonholed by recording dub, folk-rock, psychedelia and pure pop as the mood took them.
The classic line-up was Andy Partridge (guitar & vocals), Colin Moulding (bass & vocals), Dave Gregory (guitar & keyboards, left in 1999) and Terry Chambers (drums, left in 1982).
Barry Andrews was the original keyboard player but he left in 1979 to be replaced by Dave Gregory. The band ceased performing live in 1982, prompting Terry to leave and, rather than replacing him, they then used various session drummers for their remaining studio albums.
Their live legacy continues through Terry's band [a12676994]."

Over the years he has lived in Cardiff and London, but has now settled in Carmarthen, south west Wales. He was a member of several bands as a vocalist and guitarist from the age of fourteen and started writing his own songs at about the same time. His first band was The Undecided, formed in 1965. He then moved to London where he led several bands in the early seventies - Limbotrol, Boots and Butty. His first Welsh language recordings was as a session musician with Edward H Dafis, Hergest and on the recording of the rock opera Nia Ben Aur. In 1976 he returned to Wales to join ex-members of Edward H, Sidan and the singer-songwriter Endaf Emlyn to form Injaroc. The funk rock band lasted for twelve months leaving one album, Halen Y Ddaear. With three ex-members of the rock band Chwys, Geraint formed Eliffant. He was the lead singer and sole songwriter. Eliffant stayed together for almost seven years, recording two albums, MOM and Gwin Y Gwan and two singles. In 1984 Geraint started his solo recording career with the LP Madras which was followed by Rebel and Ararat."

The band emerged from the underground German rock scene with a very original and eccentric album called ""Phallus Dei"" (1969). The musicians who participated to this delirious and psychedelic experience were (among others) [a=Peter Leopold] (ex [a=Amon Düül]), the front woman and singer [a=Renate Knaup], [a=John Weinzierl] on the guitars... with guests as Holger Trützsch who plays tribal percussions (original member of [a=Popol Vuh]). Then almost with the same musicians the band recorded the seminal ""Yeti"" (1970). An album in a similar vein as the previous but more accomplished (with a couple of structured songs always with numerous pieces of epic improvisations). ""Yeti"" will launch Amon Düül II career outside Germany. The same year the bass guitarist Dave Anderson leaves the band to join [a=Hawkwind]. 

""Tanz Der Lemminge"" which follows directly ""Yeti"" is an impressive work with a great diversity of powerful, emotional songs with some folk accents next to long free space jamming. Recorded in 1972, ""Carnival in Babylon"" announces a slightly new musical direction taken by the band. This album is dominated by shorter songs with the omnipresent and beautiful vocals of Renate Knaup. A more conventional work with a few memorable prog-folk ballads. The classical period of the band will end with ""Wolf City"" (1972) and ""Vive La Trance"" (1973). After the departure of Renate Knaup who joins Popol Vuh in 1974 and the release of a few albums, Amon Düül II split up. In 1981, with the album ""Vortex"" and Renate Knaup rejoining Chris Karrer tried to reform the band without much success.

The band reformed again in 1995, releasing ""Nada Moonshine"" and performing in Europe and Japan.
Another comeback came in 2010 with the release of ""Bee As Such"" (later renamed ""Düülirium"") with the band performing again until 2018 so far. "

The group's title is an acronym for ""We Are Sexual Perverts"" as shown in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/WASP-WASP/release/1301774]first press vinyl's runout of their debut album[/url].

The band is led by vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Blackie Lawless. They arose out of Los Angeles's glam metal scene and gained notoriety for their over the top stage shows, which included the band throwing raw meat into the audience, scantily clad women on stage, and Lawless's spark-shooting codpiece.  

The group's first single, ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" brought further infamy.  

The band was commercially successful throughout most of the 1980's but also caught the attention of parent's groups, most significantly the PMRC.  Lawless continues to record and tour under the W.A.S.P. banner with various line ups. 

In the 2000s, he reclaimed the Christian faith of his youth and subsequently began toning down his stage shows and censoring some of the lyrics to some of his older, more explicit songs during live performances.  

He has also publicly stated that he will no longer play ""Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)"" due to his religious faith."

Born December 18, 1948 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (England) he is best known as the founder of [a=Be Bop Deluxe] (1972-1978), although he is also a prolific and accomplished solo artist in his own right.

Following an education at Wakefield College Of Art, Bill Nelson's first recorded works were contributions to [l=Holyground] recordings A-Austr: Musics From Holyground (1970) and [r=1393644] (1971). His first solo album [r=1753752] was released on [l=Smile Records] in 1971 and saw notable airplay by John Peel. A year later Bill formed Be Bop Deluxe, a venture that under Nelson's guidance morphed from its initial blues and glam rock beginnings into a stylistically experimental endeavour that encompassed elements of prog rock, new wave, art rock and proto punk. Bill disbanded Be Bop Deluxe in 1978, however these influences were taken further for his next project Red Noise (1978-1979), after recording [r=729832] he concentrated on working as a solo musician and received critical acclaim for his experimental synth-pop releases [r=141538], [r=874805] and [r=1418768]. The latter part of the 1980s saw Nelson progress into increasingly esoteric territory as his personal interest in occult and gnostic beliefs were packaged alongside voluminous ambient albums which were created with the immediacy of creative inspiration. This work ethic saw the release of a staggering amount of music. Despite personal and financial troubles through the late 1980s he has maintained a prolific recorded output and although he does not tour he makes a single public performance each year at annual 'Nelsonica' events in Yorkshire, England."

He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

With origins rooted in distorted rock, Kent found mainstream success through their alternative rock albums of the mid-1990s, 2000s and 2010s, the latter decades during which they adopted elements of synth-pop. On 16 March 2016, the band announced that they would release their final album, titled [i]Då som nu för alltid[/i], after 26 years of performing. The band's announcement noted that the dissolution of the band is voluntary and is despite their continued success.

In 1999 the brothers decided to form one more band together. Booking into Newcastle’s Cluny Studios with the cream of local musicians, they began to record and simultaneously return to playing live gigs.

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

John Otway, self-proclaimed as 'Rock and Roll's Greatest Failure', began his assault on the music industry in the mid-1970's in partnership with one 'Wild Willy' Barrett. They reached Number 27 in 1977 with the single 'Cor Baby, That's Really Free' but Otway's most remembered for accidentally crushing his 'crown jewels' on an amplifier whilst performing a cover of the Bob Lind song 'Cheryl's Going Home' live on the BBC's 'Old Grey Whistle Test'. Aside from numerous 'on/off' stints with Barrett he has also collaborated with Attila The Stockbroker and has gained a hardcore following performing as a solo artist and also with his 'Big Band'. Some 25 years after the 'Hit' he achieved his second (and highest charting) hit with 'Bunsen Burner' (straight in at Number 9) which was achieved via a Social Media campaign and the incredible support of his fan base. In 2013 Otway premiered his biopic 'Otway - The Movie' at the Odeon, Leicester Square, which was received with critical acclaim by the media. Ever the one for clever ways to sell his records Otway has tried them all (with varying degrees of success and failure) from releasing singles without vocals to circulating discs with counterfeit WEA labels to using the sleeves as free entry to gigs. Add to this the huge deposit paid (and lost) to hire a jet to take his fans on a World Tour that never got off the ground and two autobiographies and you have a remarkable career of more than 40 years that defies belief!

Born: 25 May 1958 in Sheerwater (Near Woking), Surrey, England, UK. 

English singer, songwriter, and previous leader of two bands: [a=The Jam] and [a=The Style Council]. In England, he is recognised as something of a national institution yet, because much of his songwriting is rooted in English culture, he has remained essentially a national rather than an international star. 

He was a central figure in the Mod revival. As the leader of [a=The Jam] he fronted the most popular British band of the punk era, influencing legions of English rockers that ranged from his mod-revival contemporaries to [a=Smiths] in the 1980s and [a=Oasis (2)] in the 1990s. 

During the final days of The Jam he developed a fascination with [l=Motown] and soul music, which led him to form the sophisti-pop group [a=The Style Council] in 1983. As The Style Council’s career progressed, Weller’s interest in soul moved towards an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which led to the gradual erosion of his audience and the eventual split of The Style Council in 1990.

Weller launched his solo career in 1992 and by the mid 1990s, he had released three successful albums which were both critically acclaimed and massively popular in England. 

Then contemporary bands like [a=Ocean Colour Scene] were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad-rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans that had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career.

Son of [a=John Weller (2)]. He married [a=Dee C. Lee] in 1987; divorced in 1998. Father of [a=Leah Weller] and [a10310152] (with Dee C. Lee). He became involved with [a=Samantha Stocks] until 2008. He married [a=Hannah Andrews] in September 2010."

German for ""fist"", and also the protagonist of Goethe's eponymous play, Faust were among the first bands to use the recording studio as an instrument and one of the originators & central pillars of the Krautrock genre. After two albums for Polydor, they were dropped due to a lack of commercial success and signed with the fledgling Virgin label. The first release to come of this new partnership was The Faust Tapes - a record comprised of edited older material, with no clearly demarcated tracks, and no titles or other information on the sleeve. In what could be seen as an early attempt at viral marketing, the disc was priced as a single and as a result sold over 50,000 copies. Faust IV was released later the same year, and had been recorded on night shifts at the label's Manor studio while Mike Oldfield tracked Tubular Bells during the day. While the group would carry on for another two years after the release of IV, no new releases appeared before the band seemingly vanished.

Throughout the 1980s the group's first three records and various unreleased archival material were released by Chris Cutler's ReR and Recommended labels - the beginning of a creative partnership which would see him go on to perform with Jean-Hervé Peron's later iteration of the group decades later. Beginning in 1994 Faust reactivated; performing live in the UK and Europe and releasing a new album, Rien, on Table Of The Elements. They would go on to tour and record extensively, with the majority of their later work being released on H.J. Irmler's Klangbad label until the group fractured into two distinct lineups in 2004. Their live appearances during both their 70s and 90s periods were infamous for their chaotic physicality and the risks often posed to the band and audience alike, with pinball machines, jackhammers, cement mixers and blowtorches all being common onstage props and sound sources."

[From Facebook:
Glen Scott is a Black British musician,singer songwriter & Music producer with a real passion for music and it's history. 

Glen Scott possesses the spirit and unfettered passion of a quintessential artist. His stylistic fusion of poetic, thought provoking, and optimistic lyrics, backed by pure unadulterated retro and modern soul, harkens comparison to such inspirational influences as Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Funkedelic (interestingly ONE NATION UNDER A GROOVE was the first album Scott bought as boy at a junk store in London).
 
Scott, Jamaican born, was raised in London, and was indoctrinated into playing music in his father’s church. By the age of nine, he had learned to play drums and Hammond organ, and also sang in the church choir. He has since added keyboards, guitar, and bass to his arsenal as a musician.
 
His CD, TRUST THE DAWN, his debut on Hidden Beach Recordings, is the embodiment and stunning reflection of all of Scott’s innate gifts as a songwriter/poet, scintillating vocalist and performer, arranger, producer, and exemplary multi-instrumentalist. Scott was signed to the label after performing an electrifying live showcase via iChat in his home of Stockholm that literally blew away label honcho Steve McKeever and staffers who viewed it in their Santa Monica offices. Scott wrote, arranged and produced all (10) songs on the CD.
 
The first single from the CD, DEEP IN IT, a heart wrenching pathos of unrequited love, was featured on the special Hidden Beach Vol 1 Valentine’s Day compilation CD, LOVE, PASSION, & OTHER EMOTIONS (Feb 1, 2011). The video became a favorite on VH1 Soul, Centric, Music Choice and YouTube. Scott made a brief promo visit to Los Angeles in support of the single, highlighted by live appearances at popular urban night spots, Jamie Foxx’s FOXXHOLE and R & B LIVE. His second single, SEND IN A LETTER, will be released in August, followed by the release of TRUST THE DAWN in October.
 
Scott, along with his Manager Ramon Hervey II, (Babyface, Vanessa Williams, Sweet Honey In The Rock, Andrae Crouch), have also created and Co-Executive Produced a
 new webisode series starring Scott entitled, LIFE IS NO REHEARSAL. The weekly series will showcase and chronicle the challenges and behind-the-scenes strategizing
 facing an artist based in Stockholm, Sweden, a Manager in New York, and label in Los Angeles, to devise a global record/artist launch. The online series will be unveiled
 as part of his CD launch.
 
Scott’s profoundly spiritual upbringing and his commitment to preserving the great tradition of R & B and Soul music, has provided the motivation to fortify his artistry
 over the past decade. He’s one of the most respected and in-demand multi-session musicians and arrangers in London, and has collaborated with a list of noted
 songwriter’s and artist’s, such as Craig David, James Morrison, Ron Sexsmith, Joshua Radin, Beverley Knight, and Eric Bibb.
 
TRUST THE DAWN, continues his legacy as bona fide solo artist, which started with his debut album WITHOUT VERTIGO, released by Sony Music/550 in 1999. The title
 track (among other songs from the album) appeared on the soundtrack of the Laurence Fishburne movie, ONCE IN MY LIFE. It was also featured in the hit TV series, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (1997) and film, AFTER SEX (starring Brooke Shields in 2000). Other releases have included, DO SOMETHING, (EP, Sony Japan, 2001) and SOULRIDER (Sony Japan, 2002). DEAFENING SILENCE, (Sony/550/Sodarock, 2000), was released independently.
 
Scott is currently a part of the Kensal Town Collective in London, recording, writing and producing acts such The Backstreet Boys, James Blunt, Lily Allen, Shane Filan to name a few whilst he completes his 5th Studio album."

Formed in 1994 and based in Riverside California, Backside has played with international touring bands such as Voodoo Glow Skulls, Guttermouth, The Vandals, Good Riddance, Blink 182, The Ataris, Youth Brigade, Strung Out and many more along with having a strong reputation for headlining and selling out various punk venues up and down their home state of California. Defiant by nature and direct to the point is unmistakably the motto for this five-piece Inland Empire punk outfit. Backside has worked hard and played even harder to earn themselves the reputation for putting on an extremely energetic live show that truly brings to life the genuine ideas, thoughts and messages contained within each song written, recorded and performed.

From punk fans to a punk band was obviously the most natural transition made by these clever kids with their hearts and minds all focused upon one common goal: to make music for change. With musical influences ranging from early punk pioneers such as Minor Threat and Bad Religion to current punk icons Rancid and NOFX it's obvious what has fueled the fire of Backside to continue what they are doing while remaining true to themselves and all in their surroundings. The DIY punk ethic holds very strong in the band and is well recognized by other bands, promoters and surrounding media.

It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.

Formed by Kirk Brandon and Stan Stammers after the demise of '[a=Theatre Of Hate]' with an original line-up that includes Chris Bell and Lascelles James for the 1983 album 'The Grapes of Wrath'. There have been many changes in the musical style and in the musicians that make up the group, with only Kirk Brandon being the constant member. Others who have been in the lineup include, Mickey Donnelly, Neil Pyzer, Alan St. Clair, Dolphin Taylor for the albums of 'One Eyed Jacks' and 'World Service'. Pete Barnacle, Steve Barnacle, Marco Perron (Marco Pirroni) and Volker Janssen for the album 'Outland'. The final album of the 80's ""The Price You Pay"" had Kirk Brandon in Guitar and Voices, Pete Barnacle in Drums, Volker Janssen in Keyboards and Chris Bostock in Basses.

HISTORY
Formed in 1983, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983 this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St Clair on guitar, John Lennard on sax and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984 John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on Saxophone.

Spear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).

""The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.""

Their second album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.

In 1985, their album, World Service reached the UK Top 20. Founder member Stan Stammers left in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit ""Never Take Me Alive"", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band’s appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon contracted Reiter disease which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.

Spear of Destiny have had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 - ""Never Take Me Alive"" (1987).

In addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, and former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor.

Brandon is also a member of the supergroup, Dead Men Walking.

THEATRE OF HATE/SPEAR OF DESTINY
Theatre of Hate was a post-punk / goth-rock band formed in Clapham, Great Britain in 1980, directed by Kirk Brandon (ex-Stigmata and The Caine), from the ashes of the punk band The Pack, formed in 1978 by Kirk Brandon (vocals, guitars), Simon Werner (guitar), Jonathan Werner (bass), and Rab Fae Beith (drums, ex-the Wall), later replaced by Jim Walker (ex-PIL), which was characterised by a raw sound that sometimes resembles Warsaw (pre-Joy Division), and they published on the Rough Trade label two singles, Brave new soldiers and King of kings, and an EP, Long live the past, which would appear after the band split, All were issued on the cd comp with The complete singles of the Pack/Theatre of Hate, released by Anagram Records in 1995, and more recently the small label Almafame released the CD Dead Ronin, containing all the songs written by Brandon and The Pack in this period, and two unpublished live videos.

After their second Peel session, in August 1981, Theatre of Hate entered the studio with producer Mick Jones to record their first studio album (and participate as a second guitarist), Westworld, released in February 1982. Shortly after the album was recorded, the new guitarist Billy Duffy (from The Nosebleeds) joined the band, and then the drummer Luke Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. The album reached number 17 in the list of albums of the United Kingdom and also generated the single Top 40 Do you believe in the Westworld ?, and included other good songs, like Judgment hymn, Love is a ghost and Conqueror.

In February of 1982, Theatre of Hate published another album in direct, He who dares wins: Live in Berlin, recorded in September of 1981.

Billy Duffy later left the band to join Ian Astbury in Death Cult. Theatre of Hate continued for a short time before splitting up later that year, after releasing the singles The Hop and Eastworld. A second studio album, Aria of the devil, was recorded, and was not published until 1998, as well as other unpublished demos of these recordings that were released as Ten years after in 1993. Brandon took over Spear of Destiny with the Bass player Stan Stammers. The album compilation Revolution was launched after the breakup of the group, spending three weeks on the British charts, reaching the number 67. Nigel Preston joined his former bandmate Billy Duffy as a drummer for The Cult, participating in his 1984 album Dreamtime.

Theatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, with a lineup that included the members of the original band Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of Pete Barnacle on drums and the guitarist of Spear of Destiny / The Mission, Mark Gemini Thwaite. A live recording of the London Astoria show with this lineup, Theatre of Hate Act 4, was later released on CD by Plastic Head Records.

In 1994, the group consisting of Brandon, Stammers, John McNutt and Art Smith entered the Mix-O-Lydian studios of Boonton, New Jersey, with Brad Morrision, to record a new album under the name of Theatre of Hate. Retribution was not published until the beginning of 1996 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Love is a ghost, published by Receiver Records in 1999, is a direct from the era that offers one of the best moments of his short career.

Coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Westworld, Theatre of Hate was reformed on a one-week tour that culminated in the Islington Academy in April 2007. The album was reissued, with the addition of new songs. Of the original lineup, only Stammers was unavailable, due to the conflict of schedules and family commitments in the United States, where he resided, being replaced by Craig Adams, former bassist with,The Sisters of Mercy and The Mission,and briefly the Cult, joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the meeting.

In May 2012, the original Theater of Hate lineup composed by Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers and John Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, gathered for three concerts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Westworld, celebrated in Bristol, London and Crewe.

Nevermore ceased activity in 2011 after Loomis and Van Williams both departed following disputes with Sheppard and Dane. The latter two then returned to the recently reactivated Sanctuary on a full-time basis. Warrel Dane later stated that Nevermore was not definitively finished. This was contradicted in a September 2017 interview with Jeff Loomis, where he confirmed that the band was broken up, but simultaneously acknowledged that a future reunion would be possible since the band members were still on speaking terms with each other. 

In December 2024, Jeff Loomis and Van Williams teased a return of the band with yet-to-be-unveiled plans for 2025.

Only existing for a brief moment in time (playing a handful of mainly local gigs and releasing one demo tape and the occasional track on compilation tapes) and obscure even during their existence, Asylum were nonetheless influential, their ‘1,000 M.P.H. Hardcore Punk’ inspiring other U.K. groups such as Skum Dribblurzzzz and Napalm Death.

Anyone else who'd supported [a3840], [a10138], [a58694] and [a260669] - and given them all a run for their money - should have been snapped up ages ago, right?

Wrong.

The four piece turned down deals from two majors on the grounds that they didn't want to ""suck corporate dick"". A general disdain for major record company types means ATL? could never in a million years have signed a major deal.

ATL? lead singer Mac's personal reticence towards major A&R men stretches back a while into the seven years he spent as a prompter at Oxford's Jericho Tavern. The Jericho was one of those toilet circuit joints that kept indie guitar music alive through the dark years of the early '90s and Mac has a fair claim to having been a key figure in many of the Oxford success stories of the last few years. As he so modestly put it ""[a10138], [a3840], [a58694] - I invented them all!""

The A&R men would phone him regularly for the gossip on the local talent - in fact he was even offered a job in A&R himself, but it really wasn't his style. ""It's no good, I'd actually want to sign bands....I'd get fired within a week!""

When [l103259] offered the band a deal they accepted on the condition that it was signed on the hallowed turf at Oxford United just before the first game of the season. The obliging label not only arranged for the club chairman to witness the contract on the day, but also for the team to beat West Ham 3-2 in Mac's honour with a superb Paul Moody hat-trick.

Arthur Turners Lovechild? are already becoming legendary and the sheer honest pleasure in their music will wake up a few pairs of ears with an attitude that hasn't been around for a long time.

Smile - you just discovered drunk rock. "

Live highlights included tours with the Original Comets, gigs in Amsterdam, Paris, Italy, Germany and Bahrain, live and studio work with Wee Willie Harris, and numerous weekender appearances; Hemsby, the Rhythm Riot, Skegness, and Pollytone Teddy Boy and Swing/Jive weekends.

The band negotiated with EMI the creation of their own label ""[l=Total Vegas Recordings]"" and in 1992 their debut EP ""Thrive"" was released by Total Vegas followed by the band's first LP ""Formaldehyde"" later in the year.  1994 saw the release of second album ""How To Make Friends And Influence People"" which generated a string of chart hits for the band including ""Oblivion"" and ""Alice, What's The Matter?""  With third LP ""Regular Urban Survivors"" (1996) Terrorvision continued on their upward trajectory and single ""Perseverance"" earned the band their first top 5 hit with further chart success for singles ""Celebrity Hit List"" and ""Bad Actress"" though real chart domination was to come in January 1999 with the number 2 smash ""Tequila"" taken from the ""Shaving Peaches (1998) album.  Despite this, EMI chose to drop the band and in early 2000 the band (and Total Vegas Recordings) were rescued by [l=Papillon Records] for whom the band recorded the 2001 album ""Good To Go.""  The reprieve however was temporary and in June 2001 the band announced their split marked by a farewell tour of the UK and a 'best of' album to satisfy EMI's five album contract entitled ""Whales & Dolphins.""  In April 2005 the band reformed for a brief UK tour with further dates in August and September, which EMI took as a good excuse to release another compilation ""B-Sides & Rarities"".

In 2010 after replacing drummer 'Shutty', they started work on an album which was completed and released in 2011 under the title 'Super Deluxe'.

They formed in 1991 at Macquarie University, with the original members being Anthony Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group shortly after the release of their first self-titled album.

After Wilcher's departure, The Wiggles fanbase grew as the played shows at kindergartens, daycares and birthday parties, adopting many of their trademarks for which they are most famous, among them colour coded skivvies and the ""wiggle fingers"" action. After a string of APRA awards, The Wiggles cemented themselves as Australia's favourite children's group, expanding their empire from just albums and videos to a feature film and a TV series in 1998. In that same year, The Wiggles traveled to Disneyland for their first performance in the USA and have since toured there many times and have even showed up in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. 

In late 2006, shortly after being named Australia's richest performers, earning $45 million in 2005, founding member Greg Page was forced to quit the band due to an illness known as Orthostatic intolerance. His replacement, Sam Moran was welcomed fans, but was controversially dismissed from the band in early 2012, as Page, health permitting, returned to the group for the 'Celebration' tour, the last time Anthony, Murray, Greg and Jeff would perform together. The Celebration tour also introduced the new generation of Wiggles, Emma Watkins, Simon Pryce and Lachlan Gillespie, with Field staying on. 

Since the group's inception, The Wiggles have sold 23 million videos and 7 million CDs, performed to an average of 1 million people per year and written some songs which are now considered children's standards, such as 'Rock-a-bye Your Bear', 'Hot Potato' and 'Can You Point Your Fingers And Do The Twist?'

Born 3 October 1938 in Albert Lea, Minnesota, USA, died 17 April 1960 in Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK.
Influential on later artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and many others. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).
Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California. Cochran became musician as a teenager, with a circle of friends that included Connie ""Guybo"" Smith whose nickname would later become one of his song titles. He teamed up with [a=Hank Cochran] (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools. They later called themselves [a=The Cochran Brothers], touring the south-western states and appearing on the California Hayride show. They recorded two hillbilly records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting [a=Elvis Presley] on the Dallas Big D Jamboree show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise"", their third recording on Ekko and a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of [a=Jerry Capehart].
In 1956 Cochran teamed up with Capehart and was signed to [l=Liberty] in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross, spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as [l=Crest], [l=Zephyr], Crash, [l=Vik], along with [l=Silver Records (9)], on which he recorded ""Guybo"", also known as ""Drum City"". He also appeared in two films.
Following up on his increasing American success, Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with [a=Gene Vincent] and [a=Ronnie Hawkins] to appear on popular TV and radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon [a=Shari Sheeley], later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.
On Sunday, April 17, 1960 — the day following the tour — Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car, also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat, and driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lamppost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs and collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries, aged 21. Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother [a=Bob Cochran], entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock'n'roll come of age in the UK."

They stayed this way until 1994, when Barrow decided to leave for personal reasons.
They forwarded a demo to the Stone Premonitions label which is specialized on promoting space/psych bands. Not really excepting a reply at all they were surprised for getting the opportunity to record in a proper studio. Soon the self titled debut was recorded - released as a cassette first. Their debut CD ""Out There"" appeared in 1997 on the Demi Monde label. Since then have continued on with the dynamic family of psychedelic artists at Stone Premonitions right through to their latest release ""The Definitive Unsolved Mysteries of Mr. Quimby's Beard"". MrQB releases feature copious amounts of swirly electronics from keyboardist Hardy amidst a mesmerizing amalgam of cosmic lock groove anthems, reggae beats, and blazing guitar leads. It's a tried-and-true recipe that the five have now taken to another realm.
Mr.Quimby's music has often been described as a combination of dark and dreamy Pink Floyd with the psychedelic high energy jams of the Ozric Tentacles and Hawkwind's extremely spacey and repetitive riffs. But even with these obvious musical influences, they still manage to hammer out a unique place of their very own in this dark and psychedelic musical universe. Those who see them live immediately embrace their music which has resulted in the beginnings of a world wide following. Mr.Quimby's Beard deserve a remarkable place in the space rock genre."

As a child he learnt to play the piano, recorder, violin, harmonium, before moving on to the guitar. In November 1963, he joined his first band called [i]The Mariners[/i], aged 17. They were followed by [i]The Crestas[/i], whom he left in 1965 and moved to London. There he joined [a=The Voice (8)], but this proved untimely as they were disbanded a short time later. Next was a soul band called [i]The Wanted[/i], but this was also short-lived and he moved back to Hull.

In 1966, he joined [i]The Rats[/i] who changed their name to [i]Treacle[/i] in 1968. Then in 1970 he was asked to join the [a=David Bowie] backing band [i]The Hype[/i], and on 5th February 1970 he made his debut for Bowie playing on his Peel Sessions, recorded for the BBC's Radio 1. The backing band began to record their own music and would go on to release in their own right. Ronson also started to work with Bowie on the arrangements, as well as arranging and producing for other artists. He ceased working with David Bowie in 1973, and began concentrating on his solo work and producing. He was for a short time a member of [a=Mott The Hoople] and had a band called [a=The Hunter Ronson Band] with [a=Ian Hunter].

Though he died in London, he was buried in Eastern Cemetery in his hometown.

A chance meeting with guitar virtuoso Hartley Cain led to the formation of a rock band. He rapidly built up a large fan base around the Midlands, London and Germany. The rock career lost momentum when the major album Rogues & Thieves did not take off but he did get on Top Of The Pops as part of his mate, Roy Wood¹s band, The Move. Gradually his music became more Country and he was invited by Mervyn Conn to be part of the famed Wembley Festivals. Mervyn Conn backed two albums recorded in Nashville with the Jordanaires and Hargus Pig Robbins. The first, Southern Fried Frog was and still is a massive seller. Froggie did and still does sing 99 percent of his own material and he has the largest following of any UK artist.
His autobiography, Raymond Who?, is a great read. UK singers cover more of his songs than any other writer. When he released Don't Let Me Cry Again, Terry Wogan played it every day for a fortnight but unfortunately a distribution blip stopped it being a major pop hit.
After fighting health problems he was still a major player on the UK Country scene having played with most of the major American artists including Tina Turner who recorded one of his songs. Raymond Froggatt is the only UK artist to have played the Albert Hall, London Palladium and the Birmingham Symphony Hall. He was one of an elite band who could have a theatre tour each year."

Over the years he has lived in Cardiff and London, but has now settled in Carmarthen, south west Wales. He was a member of several bands as a vocalist and guitarist from the age of fourteen and started writing his own songs at about the same time. His first band was The Undecided, formed in 1965. He then moved to London where he led several bands in the early seventies - Limbotrol, Boots and Butty. His first Welsh language recordings was as a session musician with Edward H Dafis, Hergest and on the recording of the rock opera Nia Ben Aur. In 1976 he returned to Wales to join ex-members of Edward H, Sidan and the singer-songwriter Endaf Emlyn to form Injaroc. The funk rock band lasted for twelve months leaving one album, Halen Y Ddaear. With three ex-members of the rock band Chwys, Geraint formed Eliffant. He was the lead singer and sole songwriter. Eliffant stayed together for almost seven years, recording two albums, MOM and Gwin Y Gwan and two singles.

In 1991 the band appeared on the [r12650585] album with one song, but decided to be credited under the alias ""[a6752991]"" (Gustavos) instead of its real name because the song was performed in pop style, which didn't reflect the band's true sound.

In 1993, the band released its only album, ""Don't Panic"", compiled of select demos and sold only through the Third Ear store. After its release, lead singer Amir Shoat and bassist John Acker, together with the guitarist Shachaf Barkai, formed a side project called ""הפרפר המכני"" (Haparpar Hamechani = The Mechanic Butterfly) which was in techno style. The project was short-lived, and came to its end after the release of their first and only single, ""המשיח הגיע"" (HaMashiach Hegi'a = Messiah Is Here), with one of its two versions featuring opera singer [a2280800] as guest vocalist.

After Infected Mushroom broke up, Shoat, Acker and Barkai relocated to London and reformed the band under the shortened name ""Infected"". Their only album under that incarnation, called ""Breathe"", came out in 1996.

In 2001, ""Don't Panic"" was rereleased on CD through Fact Records.

The famous trance duo [a14602] ""borrowed"" its name from the band, so they're sometimes referred as ""Infected Mushroom (The Original)"" to prevent confusion between the two groups."

Michael ""Denny"" Dennison - Organ 
Jeff Lynas then Kieran McCann - Bass 
Paddy Johnston then Norm Burns - Drums

The band were formed in November 1997 by five friends from belfast's mod / 60s revivalist scene. After only five rehearsals the band played their first gig at Copperfields in Belfast .

In April 1998 Kyran McCann took over as Bassist from Geoff Lynas. The five piece were picked up by manager Jim Rielly, erstwhile of from 70's punk legends Stiff Little Fingers. This led to a session at Novatech Studios where they recorded their debut EP (which ended up being an albums worth of material). They took just one day to record 11 tracks.

The subsequent release ""Cottonwool Crossroads"" was very well received, especially within the UK mod scene . The band then toured throughout the UK and Ireland and received some interest from US record labels.

1998 Norm Burns took over Drums from Paddy Johnston and a collection of new songs were then laid down at Ja Studios in March 1999. This led to interest from a well known boxing promoter Dean Powell. The Firm embarked on a frenzied summer of gigs and secured a regular spot at the Creature Club (Vicos).

The song 'Doing Me Wrong' from the Ja sessions was penned for a single release in August 1999, however in early August everything started to break down, an american record company that was interested in signing the firm pulled out due to the death of the the record company's owner and soon to follow was the departure of the bands manager Jim Reilly. It wasn't long after that before the band started falling apart due to disappointment more than anything, Joe and Kyran packed their bags which effectively killed off the band, so rather than trying find to replacements and continue along the same path - Hugh and Norm decided to explore new directions while still drawing on their deeply ingrained influences by forming The Keepers. Paddy and Denny went on to form The Penny Dreadfuls (re-named The Dreads)

Highlights of the time with the Cinnamon Firm include performing on BBC/ RTE television , playing with such great bands such as Nine Below Zero and of course spending a few hours with the modfather himself ---. Mr Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher , Matt deighton , Paulo Hewitt, Steve White etc in dublin. "

The other members are Mick Anker on bass guitar, Neville Henry on saxophone, and Tony Kiley on drums (born February 16, 1962). 
In 1984 the group released their debut album Limping for a Generation, but their first hit single came in 1986 with ""Digging Your Scene,"" from their second album Animal Magic (which reached number 21 in the UK Albums Chart).
The single attracted attention for its topical lyrics, dealing with the AIDS-fueled backlash against gay people, it peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number 7 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. In addition, it reached a high of No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 24 in Italy, and No. 25 in Germany.
In January 1987 their third album She Was Only a Grocer's Daughter (whose title is a reference to then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher), was released; it reached No. 20 in the UK, thanks to its biggest hit, ""It Doesn't Have to Be This Way,"" which reached No. 5 in the UK and number 28 in Italy. Although it was released in the United States, it didn't chart there. It is featured in the movie Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol. The song ""You Don't Own Me"" appears on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. The record also featured harmony vocals by singer-songwriter Grayson Hugh. 
Outside the group (though actually included on their fourth album, Whoops! There Goes the Neighbourhood), a successful single release by Robert Howard was ""Wait,"" which featured early Chicago House diva Kym Mazelle on female lead vocals. The record was an early British recording in the subgenre dubbed UK Garage, it reached number 7 on the UK chart. 
It would later re-appear on the Blow Monkeys' first greatest-hits album Choices – The Singles Collection, their highest-charting record, reaching No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart in 1989.
The band split up in late 1990,shortly after the release of their fifth album Springtime for the World (an EP of the same name was also released, collecting all three singles from the album). 
After briefly recording with Dee C. Lee as Slam Slam, Dr. Robert went solo. 
He contributed to Paul Weller's solo debut album, and co-wrote material with both Weller and Lee. Another notable collaborator was Beth Orton.
On 18 November 2007, the original band members announced the reunion of the Blow Monkeys, as well as a new album Devil's Tavern, and a tour in 2008. 
Released on 8 September 2008, the album was funded by the pre-orders placed by fans. Q magazine reviewed the album, saying, ""Their first album in 18 years still finds the frontman in fine voice; Robert continues to sound like he dresses only in velvet and smokes cigarillos.""
In June 2009 the band released a special-edition double digipack CD and DVD of their performance at the 100 Club in London. It featured the original line-up performing fifteen songs including ""Digging Your Scene,"" ""It Doesn't Have to Be This Way,"" and ""Wait,"" other tracks from the band's earlier work, along with a few new songs from Devil's Tavern.
January 2011 saw the release of the album Staring at the Sea, with ""Steppin' Down"" as the first single issued.
Feels Like a New Morning was released by Cherry Red Records in April 2013, accompanied by a bonus CD containing 10 Blow Monkeys songs performed by Dr. Robert.
In 2013 Sony Music issued a comprehensive three-disc box set, Halfway to Heaven: The Best of The Blow Monkeys & Dr Robert, including a 1984 concert from the Hammersmith Palais.
In October 2014 the band went to Monnow Valley Studios, Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales to record a new album, with Jon Withnall on mixing and engineering duties. 
The resulting album If Not Now, When? was released in April 2015.
In October 2017 the band released their tenth studio album The Wild River on Monks Rd. Records, and it was written and produced by Robert Howard and recorded and mixed at Gismo 7 Studio in Motril, Spain. The album features Crispin Taylor on drums and is a return to their soul/funk roots.
In October 2018 the band supported Level 42 on their Eternity Tour.
On 4 March 2020, the group's Facebook page announced they are heading back to the studio to record their 11th studio album; they also announced a subsequent tour in 2021.
In September 2021 they released the ""Journey To You"" album, produced and written by Dr Robert.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.
