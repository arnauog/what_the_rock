The group was formed by art students in Liverpool in April 1977 out of an earlier band, known variously as 'Albert Dock' or 'Albert and the Cod Warriors', who had supported the Sex Pistols on one of their infamous early gigs the previous year.

The band originally consisted of Bob Bellis (drums, vocals); John (J.J.) Campbell (vocals); Martin Dempsey (bass guitar, vocals) (later replaced by first Ray ""Chopper"" Cooper, then Mick Shiner and finally Glyn Havard); Henry Priestman (vocals, keyboards); and Martin Watson (guitar, vocals).

They played their first show (as ‘Yachts’) at Eric's nightclub in Liverpool, supporting Elvis Costello. This led to a recording contract with Stiff Records, where they released one single, the witty and self-referential ""Suffice To Say"", written by Priestman and Campbell and produced by Will Birch. The band then signed to Radar Records and released two albums, a self-titled debut (released as S.O.S. in the US) and Yachts Without Radar. Following Radar's dissolution,the band released one final single (""A Fool Like You"") on Demon before splitting up in 1981. They also released a novelty single, ""Do The Chud"", as the Chuddy Nuddies."

He left Gong at the time of [m=25501] and started a solo career.

Hillage evolved from prodigy to virtuoso and the guitar sound evolved with echoes and reverb blending with synthesizers. he was a pioneer in new age ambient music and retired from recording for a while as he went on to be a prominent producer in the early 1980's, most known for his work on the Simple Minds albums of that era. Some years later he was in a club and heard The Orb sampling his music and hooked up with them.

Some say they were moderately successful. Their most popular songs were '5705' and 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire'.

In the early 1970s Lol Mason, Steve Broughton, Max Thomas and Chris Dunn were playing folk music in the Birmingham area. They toured the clubs of the Midlands until, towards the end of 1975, they decided to turn professional. Meanwhile Broughton had begun to write songs. They were offered a recording contract by Phonogram Records on condition that they change their name (they were called ""Back In the Band"") and add drums and electric guitar. This prompted them to recruit Roger Kent and Mike Slamer.

Their first albums were City Boy (1975) and Dinner At The Ritz (1976). It was not until 1978, that they had their first hit with the song '5705'. The single reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.

Most of City Boy's albums were labelled and distributed by Vertigo Records, also known as PolyGram and Polydor.

Unable to secure a contract with any of the major companies, the band split up in 1982. Lol Mason formed The Maisonettes in 1982.

In the Philippines, the group was briefly popular for another song, ""Speechless"", the track from the band that played there. In 2000, Jorn Lande covered ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" with Ronni Le Tekro on guitar and Sid Ringsby on bass.

In August 2008, several City Boy albums, Book Early, Young Men Gone West, Dinner at the Ritz and the band's self-titled debut, were reissued. "

Albert was a session man and top sideman, playing with Jimmy Page before his Led Zeppelin days. His first number one came as part of Chris Farlowe's Thunderbirds. He then discovered Country music and backed all the American touring stars, including George Hamilton IV and Skeeter Davis. He was also the main guitarist in Jon Derek's Country Fever.

Matthews is an English musician and singer-songwriter. He was an original member of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention from 1967 to 1969 before leaving and forming his own band, Matthews Southern Comfort, which had a UK number one in 1970 with a cover version of Joni Mitchell's song ""Woodstock"". In 1971, Matthews recorded two solo albums on Vertigo and in 1972, under the sponsorship of former Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith, and surrounded by likeminded British semi-folkies (notably another ex-Fairporter, Richard Thompson), he formed Plainsong. After Plainsong collapsed due to a bandmate's alcohol problem, and with his career now based in Los Angeles, Matthews released several more albums with ad hoc bands. In 1979 his cover of Terence Boylan's ""Shake It"" reached No. 13 on the US charts. In 2000 Matthews moved to Amsterdam, where he became involved in independent music projects and collaborations, including the Sandy Denny tribute band No Grey Faith (an anagram of ""Fotheringay""). Since 2003 Matthews has worked with Dutch pianist and composer Egbert Derix. In January-February 2015 Matthews and Derix toured in California to promote the US releases of their albums; Dutch filmmakers Peter Jong and Olivier Hamaker made a documentary about the making of In The Now. In a career spanning over fifty years he has featured on over 100 albums and in 2018 published an autobiography co-written with author and broadcaster Ian Clayton, ""Thro’ My Eyes: A Memoir’’, about his life in the music industry."

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label.

The original line up consisted of Fee Waybill (Vocals), Rick Anderson (Bass), Prairie Prince (Drums), Roger Steen (Guitar and Vocals), Bill Spooner (Guitar and Vocals), Vince Welnick (Keyboards), and Michael Cotten (Synthesizer), with Mingo Lewis (Drums and Percussion) and Re Styles (Vocals) expanding the lineup to nine members during their time on A&M Records. Their live performances were surreal vaudeville shows in which songs became full fledged production numbers. 

The Tubes scored their first hit ""White Punks on Dope,"" on their self-titled debut album released on A&M records. Their second album, “Young And Rich,""  included their second hit single – the suggestive duet “Don't Touch Me There.""  The Tubes released three more albums on A&M before being dropped in 1982, slimming back down to the original lineup. Capitol Records signed them upon their release from A&M and they released their most successful album to date, the concept album “The Completion Backward Principle.""

“The Completion Backward Principle,""  contained the hits, “Don't Want To Wait Anymore,"" “Sushi Girl,” and the classic rock staple “Talk To You Later.""  

Their next release on Capitol was ""Outside Inside,"" which featured the top 10 US single “She's A Beauty.""  

In 1985 The Tubes released “Love Bomb,"" which was not a commercial success and years of expensive tours left the band a half million dollars in debt.  Capitol dropped the Tubes and lead singer Fee Waybill left the band, with David Killngsworth joining as his replacement.  

The years that followed saw several personnel changes in the band, with Spooner, Cotten and Welnick all departed by mid-1989, and Waybill ultimately returning to the band in the 1990's.  While the Tubes have continued to release music, the fame and notoriety of the late 70's and early 80's remain as the bands true legacy."

At the age of eleven, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dancing, then located in Holland Park, London, and two years later was starred to move on to the Royal Ballet School at White Lodge. However, she gave up ballet two years later, and achieved three A-Levels at Grade A. She studied classical piano to Grade 7. All her school years were spent at St Joseph's Convent School, Reading, where she became friends with Marianne Faithfull. Oldfield read English Literature and Philosophy at Bristol University.

Oldfield's musical career started in early 1968, when she made some demo recordings with her younger brother Mike Oldfield. These sessions were suggested and overseen by Mick Jagger. It is not known what became of those recordings.

Soon after this she founded the folk music duo The Sallyangie together with her brother Mike. The duo was signed to Transatlantic Records and recorded their only album at the recommendation of Pentangle band guitarist, John Renbourn, whom Oldfield met at the Troubadour Folk Club in Bristol. The album Children of the Sun was recorded in August 1968. The songs on it are mainly co-written by Sally and Mike Oldfield, and the album contained some of her brother's early guitar work.

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

Evolving from Cleveland's Teutonic protopunks, [a252899], Pere Ubu was formed late in 1975 by Thomas (aka Crocus Behemoth) and guitarist Peter Laughner (who died in 1977). Ubu's classic early singles, ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""Final Solution,"" oozed restless angst way before it became the domain of spoiled mallrats. By 1978's aggressive The Modern Dance and the wilder Dub Housing, Pere Ubu's subversions of rock were guided by superior musicianship and fallout from Thomas's Jehovah's Witness upbringing. Personality quirks split the band, and Thomas regrouped for three more self-indulgent albums through 1982, including the abstract stare-down of The Art Of Walking, all with some difficult sonic perversion to recommend them.

After several Ubus found themselves onstage in Thomas's Wooden Birds, the band was revived for 1988's The Tenement Year. With newfound focus, Pere Ubu unleashed the ravishing funhouse pop experiment of 1989's Cloudland, which treated mainstream textures like found sounds. The sparkling pop, dented by Thomas's unique warble, continued with the gently peculiar Worlds In Collision. But Ubu tired of the total pop concept and returned to quirkier pursuits for Story Of My Life. Tim Kerr Records picked up the ball with 1995's full-bodied Ray Gun Suitcase--a mix of Ubu's vicious rock, luscious pop and art-damaged identities--and a series of multimedia-enhanced EPs, for which Thomas programmed the codes."

Despite the failure of the third album in 1981, and being dropped by their label, they continued to release through Paul Walden's label ([l152816]), but feeling that the impetus had been lost, they decided to move on to pastures new in 1983.

Usually touring and sometimes recording as [a=Ronnie Hawkins] And [a=The Hawks (2)], Hawkins is legendary for his skill as a talent scout & mentor.

Marshall Tucker.
The man who inspired the Marshall Tucker Band's moniker died on 20 January 2023 at age 99. The Southern rock group was rehearsing in its early days and found a keychain with Tucker's name on it in an old warehouse in Spartanburg, S.C. In an interesting twist, Tucker was also a musician. ""Marshall was blind since birth but amazingly could play the heck out of the piano,"" the band noted on social media. ""He always said his talent was simply God-given. He tuned pianos in South Carolina for decades. We are thankful for Mr. Marshall Tucker and the life he lived."""

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

By 1973, Blackmore had steered [a170355] through a significant personnel change, with [a349634] and [a123906] being replaced by [a369909] and [a267270]. However, the new members were keen to add new musical styles and Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned ""Black Sheep of the Family"" with ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves"" turned down by the band. He decided to record the song with [a291557] instead, using Dio's band [a312415] as additional musicians. He enjoyed the results, and a full album, billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood.

After the release of three studio albums and an extensive world tour in 1977–78, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the ""sword and sorcery"" theme. Dio did not agree with this change and left Rainbow. Together with then new vocalist [a353675], Blackmore scored a hit single with “Since You Been Gone”. 

After more lineup changes and albums, Ritchie disbanded Rainbow in early 1984 to rejoin the reunited Deep Purple.

He resurrected Rainbow once again in early 1994, just after leaving Deep Purple for good. However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [a485494] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [a298038]. 

Against all expectations, Blackmore reformed Rainbow, with an all-new line-up, in late 2015. Blackmore announced that he would play ""all rock"" concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner of 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow', his first rock shows since 1997. The new Rainbow line-up was announced on November 6, 2015.

Godwin and Browne, who had enjoyed modest success as a solo artist in the early 1970s, formed Metro in 1976 and were later joined by Lyons. The lead single off their self-titled debut album, ""Criminal World"", was banned from the BBC playlist due to its sexual content. During this time, the band briefly changed their name to [a1926506] and released a single, ""Naive"", with the Police's Stewart Copeland on drums. Copeland declined an offer to become a permanent member of the band, to remain with the Police. Following the release of their debut album, Browne departed the band to resume his solo career. Godwin and Lyons carried on with the addition of new members. Metro released New Love and Future Imperfect in 1979 and 1980, respectively.

His first collection of poetry, [i]Let Us Compare Mythologies[/i], was published in 1956, followed by [i]The Spice Box of Earth[/i] in 1961.

In 1967, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk musician. In 1994, Cohen retreated to the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles, beginning what became five years of seclusion at the center. In 1996, Cohen was ordained as a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk and took the Dharma name ""Jikan"", meaning ""silence"".

In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Drummers John Ellis and [a=Chris Campbell (30)] replaced Partridge. Later, in 1973, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Campbell, respectively. A song from the last show with Atkins and Campbell and three from Halford and Hinch's first were released in 2019 on the compilation [m=1794713]. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018. For the Firepower tour he was temporarily replaced by Andy Sneap, making Hill and Halford the only remaining members from the band's early era."

They were shortly after joined by [a=John Tatum] on rhythm guitar and [a=John Speer] on drums and became [a=Spiders] in the fall of 1965. [a=Michael Bruce] replaced Tatum on guitar in 1966. The band relocated to Los Angeles in March 1967, changed their name to [a=The Nazz] in April. Fellow Phoenix musician and friend [a=Neal Smith] moved in with the band in September 1967 and replaced Speer as drummer later that fall. By March of 1968 the band changed their name again, becoming [a=Alice Cooper] to prevent confusion with [a=Todd Rundgren]'s group [a=Nazz].

Lead singer Furnier took on the identity of Alice Cooper onstage and the band went on to become one of the most popular rock bands of the early seventies.  Their overblown stage presence basically created shock rock and was hugely influential on the rock scene that followed.

The band split in 1974, initially taking a hiatus with several members working on solo projects.  Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper in 1975, and launched a successful solo career.  Bruce, Dunaway and Smith went on to form [a=Billion Dollar Babies], named after the most popular Alice Cooper album."

In 1980, the band, with new drummer John Frank, recorded a follow up titled ""Look Again"" but the band was unable to secure a record deal and the release was scrapped.  The following years were spent dealing with various line-up changes.  In 1983, ""Painting Smiles On A Dead Man"", a collection of demos, was released.

Despite this, SST was willing to do another album with the band, but Joe Nolte was so disillusioned by the group's 1989 tour that it took some time to get motivated for a new record.  The band began recording a follow-up in 1991 but, due to scheduling issues, the record was not completed until 1994.  After that, the band got caught up in a contract renegotiation with SST that delayed the release even further and the final product, entitled ""Gin & Innuendoes"" did not appear until 1996.  The Last did not release another album until 2013's ""Danger"", which saw Joe and Mike backed by longtime friends and fans Karl Alvarez and Bill Stevenson of the [a=Descendents].

Guitarist Jimmy England left the band in early 1978 and the band steered away from their punk groundwork and focused on the new power pop scene that was being fueled by ""new"" bands like, Cheap Trick, Blondie, etc.. The new 4 piece version clicked and by the end of 1978 they were signed to the new record label, Infinity/MCA and released their first (and only) album in the Spring of 1979. They did a three month tour of the U.S. with Van Halen who were on their first headlining tour. Every date was sold out and the final date was at the LA Forum. Screams then played a successful headlining tour in the UK and also appeared on the TV rock show, ""Old Grey Whistle Test"". It was November 1979 and towards the end of that tour, every major label cut their costs and '70s excess spending and many subsidiary labels like Infinity, were dropped almost over night. Unfortunately, this happened to Screams at the end of their UK tour and the band had to cut a few of the dates and return to the Midwest without a label. Their last show of their UK tour was a sold out show at the legendary Marquee Club in London. The wind was knocked out of the band and management who had just been given the word that they were good to go with their second album. With the label dropped, that was not to happen. The band continued to play shows and record demos all of 1980 but eventually decided to call it quits. The last Screams show was New Years Eve back where they began, in Pekin, IL. Brad Steakley went on to be a founding member of The Elvis Brothers and is known by the name, Brad Elvis. The Elvis Brothers were signed to Portrait/CBS for 2 albums in the early/mid '80s.

The Elvis Brothers split in 1996 and Brad formed his own bands Big Hello (3 album releases) and currently his band, The Handcuffs (3 album releases). Brad also has played drums for The Romantics for the past 11 years. John Siegle also moved to Chicago right after Screams split up and played in various bands.

A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

From their ""free-rock"" beginnings in the nascent ""krautrock"" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional ""rock"" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.

Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the ""krautrock"" twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and ""freak out jamming"" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the ""Berlin School"". Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.

After a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. [a=Paul Haslinger] replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son [a=Jerome Froese] in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own [l=TDI Music] label (later renamed [l=Eastgate]), TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate—father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories—but the group's artistic direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members."

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

A self-taught musician from an industrial southern suburb of Leeds, Chapman paid his way through art college playing in skiffle bands, strip clubs and jazz trios, plus a brief stint roadying for John Cage (“He did a recital at Leeds Art Gallery. I took him to the market to buy fish to put in his piano”). He later packed up his teaching job at Bolton College of Art, becoming a big name on the Cornwall acoustic scene. As the tale goes, one rainy night in the late 1960s he went to a pub in Cornwall, but didn’t have the money to enter. “So I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to stand outside in the rain; I’ll play guitar for half an hour for you,’” he once wrote. “They offered me a job for the rest of the summer and I’ve been at it ever since.”
He first appeared on the London and Cornwall folk music circuits in 1967, alongside [a=John Martyn] and [a=Roy Harper]. He recorded his debut album in 1969 for the [l=Harvest] label which released 3 subsequent albums. After the release of [m=575408] (1971), Chapman parted with [l=Harvest], choosing to sign to [l=Decca]’s subsidiary [l=Deram], where he began adding electric guitar and harder rhythms to his work. Several albums were released on [l=Deram] during the early to mid 1970s including [m=282153] (1976) produced by Memphis legend [a=Don Nix].
The 1980s was a quieter time for Chapman. He continued to record for numerous smaller record labels, and played on the folk and club circuits. The late 1990s onwards represented a period of rebirth for Chapman. He enjoyed critical acclaim for his albums and attracted the praise of performers like [a=Thurston Moore] and [a=Supergrass]. The 2000s saw Chapman exploring his guitar player roots and releasing instrumental albums alongside his song based sets. He toured the United States in 2011. In 2016, Chapman celebrated fifty years as a professional musician.
Towards the end of his life he still played professionally and regularly toured in the UK, Europe and US.  In a post to Instagram announcing the news, no cause of death was given, but it was stated that Chapman died at home (Wrytree, the old stone farmhouse on the windswept patch of the Pennines not far from Hadrian’s Wall near Brampton). “Please raise a glass or two to a gentleman, a musician, a husband, a force of nature, a legend and the most fully qualified survivor,” his family wrote."

Born 21 December 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
Died 4 December 1993 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015. The ZFT produced numerous posthumous releases and remasters of the back catalog. The children inherited the ZFT and remain in the industry,  [a237886] the force behind [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/2843814-Dweezil-Zappa-Plays-Zappa] ""[i]Zappa Plays Zappa[/i]"" [/url] as well as an accomplished guitarist in his own right; [a296279], [a1635870] and the more reserved [a296276].

The band was formed in Birmingham, England in 1969 by guitarist John Perry (who died shortly after and was replaced by [a=Ernie Chataway]), bassist [a=Bruno Stapenhill], drummer [a=John Partridge (2)], and singer [a=Al Atkins], who created a band name from Bob Dylan's song '[i][r=3881740][/i]'. In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Drummers John Ellis and [a=Chris Campbell (30)] replaced Partridge. Later, in 1973, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Campbell, respectively. A song from the last show with Atkins and Campbell and three from Halford and Hinch's first were released in 2019 on the compilation [m=1794713]. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974. 

The line-up featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill existed between 1974 and 1990. Priest went through a number of drummers (Hinch, Alan Moore, Simon Phillips and Les Binks) between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland (2)] joined and stayed until 1988. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court.

Halford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen and recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with the band. In 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” K.K. Downing left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Richie Faulkner. This line-up recorded two more studio albums before Tipton had to retire due to illness in 2018. For the Firepower tour he was temporarily replaced by Andy Sneap, making Hill and Halford the only remaining members from the band's early era."

Formed in 1978, Eliffant produced original material during the golden era of the Welsh language music scene. 

The songs were written and sung by Geraint Griffiths, and would probably be described as melodic rock, with twinges of folk, country, heavy metal, Americana and even jazz.

When Welsh group Injaroc split in 1977, Geraint found himself band-less until John Davies a guitarist and a member of Chwys approached him with Clive Richards on bass and Colin Owen on drums. After a few rehearsals, it was obvious there was a huge hole where the keyboards should be. In 1978 Euros Lewis with his Fender Rhodes Piano turned up, and that was when Eliffant were properly formed.

The band built up quite a reputation and following, based on high production values on stage and on record, and constant gigging throughout Wales.

The high-point for the band was when Eliffant were voted Best Rock Band 1979 by the readers of Sgrech magazine. They appeared on HTV and BBC television and recorded radio spots up until 1981 when the original five-piece band fizzled out, but re-formed a few months later with Gordon Jones replacing Colin Owen on the drums. Eliffant lasted another two years, but Geraint himself launched into a very successful solo career that continues today.

Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.

He attended Ipswich and Winchester Arts Schools where he studied with [a=Tom Phillips (3)], Roy Ascott, [a=Christian Wolff], Anthony Benjamin, [a=Noel Forster] and [a=George Brecht].

Starting his musical career early, first thing of note being with the band [a=Roxy Music], Eno has gone on to produce a number of highly eclectic and increasingly ambient electronic and acoustic albums, and also works frequently as producer for many popular artists. 

He is widely cited as coining the term ""ambient music"", with his series of albums using the term recorded between 1978 and 1982. 

He collaborated with [a=David Byrne], formerly of [a=Talking Heads], on ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/Brian-Eno-David-Byrne-My-Life-In-The-Bush-Of-Ghosts/master/6392]My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts[/url]"" (1981) which was one of the first albums not in the rap or hip-hop genres to extensively feature sampling.

He is an innovator across many fields of music and collaborated on the development of the Koan algorithmic music generator. He has also been involved in the field of visual arts. 

In 1996 Brian Eno, and others, started the Long Now Foundation to educate the public into thinking about the very long term future of society. Brian Eno is also a columnist for the British newspaper, The Observer.

Zappa emerged as their creative leader and the band became 'The Mothers' (as in mother-f**kers = good musicians). After signing to [l=Verve Records] this was changed to 'The Mothers Of Invention' at the insistence of the label. Until Zappa founded his own label the appendage was usually added in mock deference and the band were usually referred to as 'The Mothers'.

Guitarist [a=Elliot Ingber] then joined and, for much of their seminal 1960's albums, the group also included woodwind player [a=Bunk Gardner], saxophonist [a=Motorhead Sherwood], keyboardist [a=Don Preston], multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian Underwood] and additional drummers [a=Billy Mundi] and [a=Art Tripp].

During Zappa's jazz/classical rock period of 1969-1970, his works were augmented by violinists [a=Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris] and [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], percussionist [a=Ruth Underwood] and drummers [a=Aynsley Dunbar] and [a=John Guerin]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Uncle Meat"", ""Hot Rats"", ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"" and ""Burnt Weeny Sandwich"".

Two more jazz rock albums, ""Waka Jawaka"" and ""The Grand Wazoo"", were recorded with much of the previous jazz-rock group including Preston, Ian and Ruth Underwood, Dunbar, Ponty, Guerin and Duke.

Australian poet, guitarist, singer, composer and performance artist [a=Daevid Allen] moved to Paris in 1960. Inspired by the emerging 'Beat Generation' of writer's works he'd discovered whilst working in a Melbourne bookshop he moved into a room in Paris's 'Beat Hotel' and spent time around the city's Latin Quarter. There, he rubbed shoulders with [a=Terry Riley] and [a=William S. Burroughs], gaining free access to the area's jazz clubs. Influenced by the music philosophies of [a=Sun Ra] he formed the [a=Daevid Allen Trio], a free-jazz outfit which performed in Burroughs' theatre pieces based on that writer's novel 'The Ticket That Exploded'. 

In 1961 Allen travelled to Canterbury, England, where he met 16 year-old [a=Robert Wyatt] (who was the son of his landlord). Their mutual interest in jazz resulted in a few gigs, in London in 1963, as the Daevid Allen Trio (with [a=Hugh Hopper] on bass and [a=Mike Ratledge] occasionally guesting on piano). Around the same time, Wyatt formed the [b][a=Wilde Flowers][/b] with the Hopper brothers, Hugh and Brian Hopper, with [a=Kevin Ayers] on vocals.

The impetus behind the formation of [a=Soft Machine] occurred in a meeting of Daevid Allen and Kevin Ayers with Texan millionaire Wes Brunson in Deya, Majorca, on Easter Sunday 1966. Brunson agreed to put up the money for a new band, which allowed the group to buy equipment and rent a rehearsal room near Canterbury. The original line-up consisted of Robert Wyatt on drums and vocals, Mike Ratledge on keyboards, Daevid Allen on guitar and Kevin Ayers on bass and vocals. From May 1966 they gigged as Mister Head (aka Mr Head) and became [b]Soft Machine[/b] in August 1966.

The name was taken from a William S. Burroughs novel 'The Soft Machine' (part of The Nova Trilogy), with agreement from the author. The title The Soft Machine encapsulates the Human Body, and the main theme of the book - as explicitly written in an appendix - concerns how control mechanisms invade the body. One poem, entitled Mens (Man, as in 'human'), by Dutch-American hematologist and poet Leo Vroman starts with the line: ""Man is a soft machine...""

Mike Ratledge says of this : ""... Soft machine was a generic term for the whole of humanity, and we were all soft machines... I guess our basic assumption was that what we liked, everybody else was going to like as well, that we all had things in common, and therefore we all are soft machines, and we were all going to like Soft Machine music. It might have been a false assumption, but I hope it's true"".

In January 1967, the band's first single release, [i][b][m16803][/b][/i], was recorded.. Celebrating its release on February 22nd 1967 the band gave a press conference at The Speakeasy, performing that evening at The Roundhouse as the opening act for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience] - where Hendrix jammed with them on bass. 

Allen recalls their introduction to The Speakeasy by [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], the promoter, producer, founder of the Crawdaddy Club and original manager of both [a=The Yardbirds] and [a=the Rolling Stones]; “He would take us there and ply us with whiskeys on the expense account. We’d meet all the big stars at the time. It was like being at court, only a rock ‘n’ roll court. ‘Cause [a=the Beatles] were there, the Rolling Stones were there – everybody, all the big names, would gather at the Speakeasy at this particular time.” [From the book 'Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous' by Graham Bennett].

Three months later, a collection of demos was recorded at DeLane Lea Studios with producer [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], but not officially released until 1971 as two compilations on the French [l=BYG Records] label. At that time, Soft Machine had already become something of a 'cult' band on the London psychedelic scene, gigging at places like the Zebra Club, The Marquee, The Roundhouse, UFO (Underground Freak Out club) and Middle Earth. Light shows were also developed with Mark Boyle's Sensual Laboratory. On April 29th, 1967, they took part in the '14 Hour Technicolor Dream', an event set up by the underground paper 'International Times', which also featured [a=Pink Floyd], [a=the Move], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Crazy World of Arthur Brown], [a=Tomorrow (2)], [a=Mothers of Invention], [a=Velvet Underground] and artists such as [a=Alan Ginsberg] and [a=Yoko Ono].

During the summer of 1967 the band toured France, performing at psychedelic events along the Cote d’Azur such as [a=Jean-Jacques Lebel]’s “Sunlove Happening” and [l=Eddie Barclay]’s “La Nuit Pschedelique”. For three weeks they provided daily musical “transmissions hallucinatoires” for wildly popular performances of “Le Désir Attrapé par la Queue”, a Pablo Picasso play produced by Lebel at the Festival de la Libre Expression outside Saint-Tropez. A legendary performance of “Do It Again” helped Soft Machine to make an enormous impression in France and, by the end of the Summer of Love, they became the favorite band of the French avant-garde. 

On the way back Daevid Allen was refused re-entry to England and stayed in France, moving on to various projects before forming [a=Gong] two years later, while Robert Wyatt, Mike Ratledge and Kevin Ayers decided to carry on Soft Machine as a trio.

In February 1968, Soft Machine embarked on a three month US tour (opening for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience]), recording their first album during their touring schedule in New York in four days in April 1968, with production handled by Tom Wilson and former [a=Animals] bassist and Hendrix producer [a=Chas Chandler]. Although quickly made and not particularly well-recorded, the band's eponymous album [i][b][m=16766][/b][/i] (1968) is now considered a classic of the extraordinarily creative post-psychedelic and pre-progressive period of the late 1960's.

The band split up in December 1968, re-formed in February 1969 and carried on until the late 1970's through many line-up changes and leaving no original member onboard. It re-formed briefly in 1980 and 1984. Robert Wyatt formed [b][a=Matching Mole][/b] in October 1971. ""Matching Mole"" is a clever mis-pronounciation of ""La Machine Molle"", the French title of William Burroughs' novel ""The Soft Machine"".

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.  

All the members contributed to the songwriting but lyrics were often provided by people outside of the group, including Sandy Pearlman, rock scribe [A=Richard Meltzer], poets [a=Patti Smith] (Lanier's longtime companion) and [a=Jim Carroll], and science fiction author [a=Michael Moorcock], amongst others.  Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"".

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.

Mills-Cockell was one of the earliest adopters of the Moog synthesizer, and is generally regarded as a pioneer in the field of electronic music. He's never reached the acknowledgement and record sales like his European contemporaries, though, and is hardly known outside Canada which is a shame.

Mills-Cockell studied music at the University of Toronto from 1963 to 1967, and  piano and composition at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto from 1964 to 1968, where he also taught electronic music. He undertook graduate studies at the University of Toronto’s Electronic Music Studio in 1967 and 1968. After a stint in the avant-garde mixed media project ""Intersystems"" in 1968, and forays into the rock forum the following year with the ""[a=Kensington Market]"" in Toronto and the lesser-known ""[a=Hydro Electric Streetcar]"" out in Vancouver, electronics composer John Mills-Cockell formed the groundbreaking, though criminally ignored, ""Syrinx"" in 1970. This led to a pair of LPs, the meandering synthwork of 1970's 'Syrinx', as well as the follow-up 'Long Lost Relatives'.

The years 1972-74 were spent across the pond in Europe, with Mills-Cockell soaking up old world influences for the recording of hisfirst solo albums, ""Heartbeat"" and """"A Third Testament"", released in 1973 and 1974 respectively. In 1977, he released his third solo effort, the synth-pop ""Gateway"" LP. Mills-Cockell was one of the earliest adopters of the Moog synthesizer, meeting several times with [a107251], and is generally regarded as a pioneer in the field of electronic music. He has also composed scores for such feature films as 'The Clown Murders' (1976), Deadly Harvest (1977), Terror Train (1980), Humongous (1982), and Striker's Mountain (1985)."

Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving.

Devo was formed in 1973 as 'Sextet Devo,' a division of the arts collective Art Devo. This early line up featured [a278600], [a=Mark Mothersbaugh], [a=Robert Casale], [a=Bob Lewis (5)] and two others. In 1974 the group rebranded as simply 'DEVO' (stylized in all caps) and began writing material for their first album. Bob Lewis and Robert Casale had left the group by this time, and [a=Bob Mothersbaugh] & [a=Jim Mothersbaugh] had joined. This line-up is primarily featured in the [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4570051-Devo-Hardcore]Hardcore Devo collections[/url]. Shortly after production wrapped on their short film [i]The Truth About De-Evolution[/i], Robert Casale rejoined the group along with new drummer [a=Alan Myers], who replaced Jim. With this line-up, the group began releasing material through [l=Booji Boy Records] and attracted mainstream attention through live performances and singles.  
In February of 1978, the group recorded their first album, produced by [a=Brian Eno], and the group were given a multi-album contract with [l=Warner Bros. Records] and [l=Virgin]. 
Midway through production of their second album, [m=52668], Devo shifted from their earlier guitar-based sound toward a more keyboard-heavy one, with rhythm guitarist Robert Casale switching to keyboards and bassist Gerald Casale switching to synth-bass. This new style would be a defining one and produced the group's biggest hits.

After the commercial failure of their sixth studio album, [m=52782], the group were dropped by Warner and Virgin. They were forced into a four-year hiatus, returning in 1988 with [A=David Kendrick] replacing Alan Myers on drums. The Kendrick line-up of the group only officially lasted for three years before entering another hiatus in 1991. Throughout the 1990s, Devo would reunite for one-off singles for film soundtracks before officially reuniting in 1996 with [a=Josh Freese] on drums. After this, Devo consistently toured a greatest hit show before releasing their ninth studio album [m=255151] in 2010. 

On February 17th, 2014, Robert Casale died of heart failure. The group briefly continued without him on the Hardcore Devo tour, in which they performed material written between 1974 - 1977. Devo continues to perform live with Josh Hager on rhythm guitar and keyboards.

The Imperials have had a rotating roster and sound over the years beginning to slowly morph into CCM beginning with [m502239]. 

The group established a relationship with [a=Elvis Presley] in 1966 as studio singers. In 1968, they became backing vocalists for [a=Jimmy Dean]  and did the same for Presley the following year working for both concurrently for a time. The band ended the deal with Presley first after 1971. They set a first for Christian music when they integrated the group by adding [a=Sherman Andrus] in February of 1972. That same year, they stopped backing Dean and from that point focused exclusively on work in the gospel music industry. They would go on to win four Grammys and 15 Dove Awards over their long career.

In September 2004, Armond Morales transferred ownership of the name ""The Imperials"" to the lineup at the time: son Jason Morales, Jeremie Hudson, Ian Owens and Shannon Smith.

Band history
1979-1987 - lineup #1

Secret Service is a Swedish pop/new wave band, originally formed 1979. [a98922], former vocalist of [a380822] and then a publishing manager at Sonet Music, teamed up with [a98924] and [a282399] to write a few songs that they submitted to Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualifiers for the European Song Contest. They did not win but decided to continue working together and changed their band's name from Ola+3 to Secret Service. Besides Ola Håkansson (vocals), Tim Norell and Ulf Wahlberg (keyboards), the original lineup included Tonny Lindberg (guitars), Leif Paulsen (bass) and ​Leif Johansson (drums, ex Ola & the Janglers).

Tim Norell however, who along with lyric writer [a486079] (no relation), penned most songs of the band, did not appear with the band on stage or on the album covers. Secret Service's first single ""Oh Susie"" became a hit in Sweden and several other countries of Europe and South America. ""Oh Susie"" was no 1 in 29 countries.

The same titled album included another hit, ""Ten O'clock Postman"" Other singles followed, with their synthesizer based number ""Flash in the Night"" hitting the charts all over continental Europe. Later, Ola Håkansson sang duet with ex-ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog, ""The Way You Are"".

In 1987, Håkansson, Norell, and Wahlberg released ""Aux Deux Magots"", their sixth album as Secret Service. The other members of the band had quit by then and were replaced by multi-instrumentalist Anders Hansson and bassist Mats Lindberg. Björn Håkanson had at that time left the group as lyricist and Ola had taken over that part together with Alexander Bard. (Army Of Lovers)

1988-2000 - Hiatus
1988, Håkansson, Norell, and Wahlberg decided to go separate ways. Håkansson continued as Norell's partner together with Anders Hansson and became a well known songwriting trio. In 1992, Håkansson and his associates established Stockholm Records as a joint venture with Polygram. They produced Army Of Lovers and The Cardigans, among others.

Wahlberg continued working as a producer, songwriter with both local and international artists. He started his own company XTC Productions in 1989 launching Swedish artists abroad. He also started up his own professional recording studio - XTC Studios.

2000 - Reunion
1999 Ola, Ulf and Tim got together to compile a new compilation with Secret Service songs, Top Secret – Greatest Hits. The work took place in XTC Studios and it all led to the recording of four new tracks for the album.

2006 Forward, Member lineup #3

Secret Service had fans in the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe during the Cold War. Faced with a 1980's gala in Moscow in December 2006, Ulf and Tim re-assembled the band, however, with a new lineup. Because of family and business reasons Ola decided to not join the band at live performances and tours. So together with Mats Lindberg (bass) from the 2nd lineup, they invited Mikael Erlandsson (vocals and guitar) and Jaime Borger (drums) to join the new live version of the band. Since then the band has successfully toured all over Russia and other territories with this lineup.

2012 ""The Lost Box""

2012 was the time for a world-wide release of ”The Lost Box”. An album consisting of more or less forgotten and never completed songs from the years behind, but very well achieved by the audience. The album was also distributed as a vinyl album 2017 by B-Stars. 

2019 
On Dec 3, 2019 the band released the single “GO ON”, with music and lyrics by Tim Norell. The arrangement is made in collaboration with Anders Hansson.

2020
On April 10, 2020, the second song in the Secret Service project ”Four Seasons” was released: ”Secret Mission”. Written by Tim Norell and arranged by Anders Hansson. Lead vocals by new singer Johan (AKA John) Becker, with Tim Norell and Ulf Wahlberg on backing vocals."

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

That song and I Love You were also hits in the United States ; Couldn't Get It Right reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977, and ""I Love You"" peaked at No. 12 in 1981

In 1985, Cooper and Glover recruited guitarist Lester Hunt, drummer Roy Adams, and original member Derek Holt to record the Climax Blues Band album Drastic Steps, and this line-up toured in support of the album in the UK, Europe and America. The new line-up soon became established with Cooper, Glover, Hunt, Adams and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s, releasing the live album Blues From The Attic in 1993 and Big Blues in 2004.

Cooper died of cancer, aged 69, in July 2008. He is survived by his wife and two children. He wanted the band to continue, as the other musicians had all been long serving (Glover since 1980, Adams and Hunt since 1985, and Simpson since 1991). Cooper was replaced by singer and saxophone and harmonica player Johnny Pugh, who retired in 2012, and was replaced in turn by vocalist Graham Dee and saxophone player Chris Aldridge. 

In 2019, Climax Blues Band released Hands Of Time, a new album of original bluesy funk, soul and jazz rock material that has received rave reviews.

Adi Newton formed the first lineup of Clock DVA in 1978, after his departure from The Future (the other members of which would go on to form The Human League and Heaven 17) with Judd Turner (bass), David J. Hammond (guitar), Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophone, clarinet).
The term 'DVA,' [meaning 'two' in Russian] was inspired by Anthony Burgess' satirical science fiction novel, 'A Clockwork Orange.').
Originally focusing on experimental music inspired by science fiction and the occult (with the latter fading as time went on) and later reflecting the burgeoning industrial and electronic body music that had begun seeping into underground music scenes on both sides of the Atlantic.
After a handful of privately produced cassettes (most of which have since been collected in the 'Horology' boxed sets of lps from the German label Vinyl-On-Demand) the band released a cassette on Throbbing Gristle's Industrial Records label.
""White Souls In Black Suits"" features founder members Adi Newton (vocals, violin, EMS Synthi E, tapes), Steven James ""Judd"" Turner (bass, vocals, treatments, rhythm machine, ex-Block Opposite), and the original guitarist David J. Hammond (guitar, treatments). Two additional musicians were added to the line up, Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophones, flute, and percussion,) and featured a sound much more in line with their contemporaries outside of the Sheffield scene (which had gravited to a smoother more pop oriented sound, for the most part.) The first formalised DVA line up also featured Simon Mark Elliot-Kemp on synthesiser.

In 1981, David J Hammond left and guitarist Paul Widger joined in 1980. The following album, ""Thirst,"" was produced by Psychic TV producer Ken Thomas and released through the independent record label Fetish (and was cited, by the NME Journalist Paul Morley, as one of the great albums of the 80's alongside Joy Division's ""Unknown Pleasures"" and The Fall's ""Dragnet"".)  After ""Thirst"", Newton & Turner decided to take Clock DVA into another direction and parted company with Qual, Collins and Widger, who consequently formed the short lived group The Box. Tragedy struck later with the death of co-founder Steven James Turner. By 1983, with Newton as the only remaining original member, replacements had been found in John Valentine Carruthers (guitar), Paul Browse (saxophone), Dean Dennis (bass) and Nick Sanderson (drums). A brace of singles then preceded ""Advantage"", their first album for Polydor Records. The following year Carruthers and Sanderson departed, leaving Clock DVA to continue as a trio. Although it would be five years before another Clock DVA album, Newton remained busy with his audio visual conceptual project [a=The Anti Group] (TAGC) which researched and developed ambisonics and psychoacoustics through experimental uses of frequencies and ambient acousmatic sound pieces, alongside visual and conceptual text pieces.
The album, ""The Delivery"" (a soundtrack album for a TAGC 16 mm film,) a series of recordings including ""Documents"" and the acclaimed ambisonic album ""Digitaria"" and the pioneering ""Meontological Research Recordings"" were released, as well as the soundtrack to ""Burning Water"", a 25 min TAGC film.
In 1988 ""Buried Dreams"" was recorded utilising the first digital sampling synthesisers and computer sequencing which Newton had been experimenting with in TAGC, released in 1989 by Interfisch, and often hailed as the group's masterpiece. By the time of 1991's ""Transitional Voices"", Browse had been replaced by Robert E. Baker, of TAGC. The departure of Dennis after the completion of ""Man Amplified"" and ""Digital Soundtracks"" in 1992 left the remaining duo of Newton and Baker to record ""Sign"", released on the Italian Record Label Contempo.

After 15 years of silence, Adi Newton reactivated Clock DVA.  Since 2011 the new line-up (feat. Maurizio ""TeZ"" Martinucci) has performed at major independent electronic festivals and venues throughout Europe. The 'Horology' series of vinyl box sets compiling early cassette-only material began in 2012 (with three volumes released as of 2019) and Mute Records have signed a contract with Newton to reissue all of the official Clock DVA recordings (minus private press cassette releases) along with a new studio album.
A ""new"" album, ""Post-Sign"" was released in 2013, having been recorded in 1994/95 by Newton as an instrumental companion album to ""Sign"", which had remained unreleased due to problems with an Italian record label after Contempo's demise.
""Clock 2"", a printed aluminium USB Smart Media Card in printed metal box was released with all new material plus remixes by ATOM, Scanner, Frank Bretschneider and also features several videos by [a3925208] and a 48-page PDF, was release in 2014, as well as a limited silkscreened double sleeve 45rpm 12"" of ""The Konstructor/De Konstructor"" with two DVA remixes, both through Newton's own label Anterior Research Media Communications _ armcomm.co.uk.

Robert John is an American singer-songwriter

John – born Robert John Pedrick – had been recording since he was 12 years old, first charting in 1958 (as ‘Bobby Pedrick’), and then continuing to record through the 60s for a variety of labels.

He recorded ‘Raindrops, Love and Sunshine’ in 1970, featuring his powerful (nearly ear-shattering) falsetto, and an arrangement that owes a huge debt to the previous year’s mega-hit ‘More Today Than Yesterday’ by the Spiral Starecase.

John went on to have a number of hits in the 70s and 80s, including the aforementioned ‘Sad Eyes’ (#1 1979) and even and putting that falsetto to use again in 1983 with a remake of the Newbeats ‘Bread and Butter’ (#68 1983), which came out on Motown.

That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs. It was also the label's idea to release the album under the name [b]Johnny Cougar[/b] which Mellencamp did not approve of.
It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks.

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].
The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.
In 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).
They were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.

In 1967, he finished his musical studies at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, where he obtained honours in Piano, Church Organ, Harmony and Counterpoint. His love for other types of music grew by devoting himself to Jazz, Ballet, Cabaret, Film and Pop music, while accompanying other musicians. 

Rick is most known as artistic leader, composer and keyboard-player of the Dutch symphonic rock band, Ekseption (1967-1974, 1978-1994 reunion, and 2003). He played also in Trace (1973-1976), Cum Laude (1980-1989) and the studio-band Mistral (1977-1980), as well as producing several records on his own label. Typical of his work were combinations of classical music (church-organ) with modern pop, and rock. Rick was the first (well-known) musician to play synthesizer in The Netherlands, where he worked with many local artists, either on record or on stage, including: [a314360], [a256972], Connie van den Bos, [a512412] and [a283019].

[a=Frank Zappa] teamed with gigging R&B group 'The Soul Giants' in 1964. The band included vocalist [a=Ray Collins], bassist [a=Roy Estrada] and drummer [a=Jimmy Carl Black]. Zappa emerged as their creative leader and the band became 'The Mothers' (as in mother-f**kers = good musicians). After signing to [l=Verve Records] this was changed to 'The Mothers Of Invention' at the insistence of the label. Until Zappa founded his own label the appendage was usually added in mock deference and the band were usually referred to as 'The Mothers'.

Guitarist [a=Elliot Ingber] then joined and, for much of their seminal 1960's albums, the group also included woodwind player [a=Bunk Gardner], saxophonist [a=Motorhead Sherwood], keyboardist [a=Don Preston], multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian Underwood] and additional drummers [a=Billy Mundi] and [a=Art Tripp]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Freak Out!"" (1966), ""Absolutely Free"" and ""We're Only In It For The Money"" (1967), ""Cruising With Ruben & the Jets"" (1968) and ""Uncle Meat"" (1969).
During Zappa's jazz/classical rock period of 1969-1970, his works were augmented by violinists [a=Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris] and [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], percussionist [a=Ruth Underwood] and drummers [a=Aynsley Dunbar] and [a=John Guerin]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Uncle Meat"", ""Hot Rats"", ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"" and ""Burnt Weeny Sandwich"". 

From 1970-72, Zappa formed a new line-up with former [a48408] members [a=Flo & Eddie] and bassist [a=Jim Pons]. Preston, Underwood and Dunbar remained in the line-up, along with additional keyboardist [a=George Duke]. This line-up was disbanded, after Zappa was pushed from the stage by a fan in 1972. (He could not tour for the next year). Two more jazz rock albums, ""Waka Jawaka"" and ""The Grand Wazoo"", were recorded with much of the previous jazz-rock group including Preston, Ian and Ruth Underwood, Dunbar, Ponty, Guerin and Duke. Trumpeter [a=Sal Marquez] was also added. Zappa and the band went back to vocal rock songs with jazz elements in 1973 on ""Over-Nite Sensation"", then 1974's ""Apostrophe"" and 1975's ""One Size Fits All"". Much of the same band remained, along with new members [a2636463] (trombone), [a=Tom Fowler] (bass) and [a=Napoleon M. Brock] (saxophone). In 1975 Zappa called a halt to this backing band. By the late '70s an entirely new support band was formed, with only occasional participation from past members, including a re-appearance of [a=Captain Beefheart]. Beginning in the 80's, past 'Mothers' members Collins, Black, Gardner, Sherwood, Preston, Tom and Bruce Fowler occasionally played in a mock Zappa band, 'The Grandmothers'. In 1985 Zappa adroitly used 'The Mothers Of Prevention' in his assault on American censorship aspects of the music industry.

John Otway, self-proclaimed as 'Rock and Roll's Greatest Failure', began his assault on the music industry in the mid-1970's in partnership with one 'Wild Willy' Barrett. They reached Number 27 in 1977 with the single 'Cor Baby, That's Really Free' but Otway's most remembered for accidentally crushing his 'crown jewels' on an amplifier whilst performing a cover of the Bob Lind song 'Cheryl's Going Home' live on the BBC's 'Old Grey Whistle Test'. Aside from numerous 'on/off' stints with Barrett he has also collaborated with Attila The Stockbroker and has gained a hardcore following performing as a solo artist and also with his 'Big Band'. Some 25 years after the 'Hit' he achieved his second (and highest charting) hit with 'Bunsen Burner' (straight in at Number 9) which was achieved via a Social Media campaign and the incredible support of his fan base. In 2013 Otway premiered his biopic 'Otway - The Movie' at the Odeon, Leicester Square, which was received with critical acclaim by the media. Ever the one for clever ways to sell his records Otway has tried them all (with varying degrees of success and failure) from releasing singles without vocals to circulating discs with counterfeit WEA labels to using the sleeves as free entry to gigs. Add to this the huge deposit paid (and lost) to hire a jet to take his fans on a World Tour that never got off the ground and two autobiographies and you have a remarkable career of more than 40 years that defies belief!

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

LaBeef stood 6' 7"" (2.0 metres) tall and was given the nickname ""Sleepy"" from the appearance of his eyes. He was raised on a melon farm and moved to Houston when he was 18. There, he sang gospel music on local radio and put together a bar band to play venues as well as radio programs such as the Houston Jamboree and Louisiana Hayride.

In the 1950s, as the rockabilly component of rock-n-roll became evident, LaBeef began recording singles in the genre; his first, ""I'm Through"", was issued on Starday Records in 1957. In 1964, he moved to Nashville and moved to a more solidly country style, recording singles for Columbia Records. His first genuine hit was in 1968 with ""Every Day"", which peaked at #73 on the U.S. Billboard Country charts. After moving to Plantation Records in 1969, he scored a second hit in 1971 with ""Blackland Farmer"", which charted at #67. Around this time LaBeef also starred in the horror movie The Exotic Ones. LaBeef transferred to Sun Records in the 1970s and continued releasing albums and touring widely; his popularity flagged in America but rose in Europe. The 1980s saw him sign to Rounder Records, where he released albums into the 1990s.

Influential on later artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and many others. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).
Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California. Cochran became musician as a teenager, with a circle of friends that included Connie ""Guybo"" Smith whose nickname would later become one of his song titles. He teamed up with [a=Hank Cochran] (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools. They later called themselves [a=The Cochran Brothers], touring the south-western states and appearing on the California Hayride show. They recorded two hillbilly records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting [a=Elvis Presley] on the Dallas Big D Jamboree show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise"", their third recording on Ekko and a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of [a=Jerry Capehart].
In 1956 Cochran teamed up with Capehart and was signed to [l=Liberty] in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross, spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as [l=Crest], [l=Zephyr], Crash, [l=Vik], along with [l=Silver Records (9)], on which he recorded ""Guybo"", also known as ""Drum City"". He also appeared in two films.
Following up on his increasing American success, Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with [a=Gene Vincent] and [a=Ronnie Hawkins] to appear on popular TV and radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon [a=Shari Sheeley], later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.
On Sunday, April 17, 1960 — the day following the tour — Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car, also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat, and driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lamppost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs and collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries, aged 21. Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother [a=Bob Cochran], entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock'n'roll come of age in the UK."

Excerpts from Wikipedia:
The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) is one of five permanent symphony orchestras based in London. It was founded by the conductors Sir Thomas Beecham and Malcolm Sargent in 1932 as a rival to the existing London Symphony and BBC Symphony Orchestras. The founders' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. 

Unlike its London rivals the RPO and the Philharmonia, the post-war LPO was not exclusively associated with one company, and as well as Decca it recorded for Philips, CBS, RCA, Chandos and many other labels. The orchestra has been associated with the Royal Festival Hall since its opening in 1951, and has been its Resident Orchestra since 1992. In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra was particularly associated with Lyrita, an independent company specialising in neglected British repertoire. In most LPO recordings for Lyrita the conductor was Boult; in the same period he also recorded extensively for EMI, with the LPO his preferred orchestra. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once, and consequently appeared under the name ""The Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra"" in some of its recordings."

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

Leo the Last (directed by John Boorman) was Myrow's first feature film score. During the period from 1969 on, he composed the scores to twenty-five other films including Soylent Green, Scarecrow and director Don Coscarelli's other feature films including Jim The World's Greatest, Kenny & Company, Phantasm II and also Survival Quest and Phantasm III with co-composer Christopher L. Stone.

Mr. Myrow was a long-standing resident of Los Angeles and, under the banner of his Rashine Music Works Co., worked in his own studio on recording and film projects. Myrow also owned and operated Axis Mundi, a production company and record label. 

During his career, Myrow collaborated with artists as disparate as Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, singer Georgia Brown, actress Susan Tyrell and opera director Peter Sellars.  Fred Myrow died on January 14th, 1999."

Having recorded numerous albums and singles over a career lasting more than 40 years, his biggest record was ""A Little Bitty Tear"" released by Decca as a single in November 1961.  In 1962 he released another hit single ""Funny Way of Laughin'"", it appeared on the album ""It's Just My Funny Way of Laughin'"" and won Ives a Grammy Award for Best Country Western Recording.

He recorded numerous children's recordings and recorded several religious albums for Word Records and made a significant contribution to the popularization of folk music.

Their live performances were surreal vaudeville shows in which songs became full fledged production numbers. 

The Tubes scored their first hit ""White Punks on Dope,"" on their self-titled debut album released on A&M records. Their second album, “Young And Rich,""  included their second hit single – the suggestive duet “Don't Touch Me There.""  The Tubes released three more albums on A&M before being dropped in 1982, slimming back down to the original lineup.

“The Completion Backward Principle,""  contained the hits, “Don't Want To Wait Anymore,"" “Sushi Girl,” and the classic rock staple “Talk To You Later.""  

Their next release on Capitol was ""Outside Inside,"" which featured the top 10 US single “She's A Beauty.""  

In 1985 The Tubes released “Love Bomb,"" which was not a commercial success and years of expensive tours left the band a half million dollars in debt.  Capitol dropped the Tubes and lead singer Fee Waybill left the band, with David Killngsworth joining as his replacement.  

The years that followed saw several personnel changes in the band, with Spooner, Cotten and Welnick all departed by mid-1989, and Waybill ultimately returning to the band in the 1990's.  While the Tubes have continued to release music, the fame and notoriety of the late 70's and early 80's remain as the bands true legacy."

Some say they were moderately successful. Their most popular songs were '5705' and 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire'.

In the early 1970s Lol Mason, Steve Broughton, Max Thomas and Chris Dunn were playing folk music in the Birmingham area. They toured the clubs of the Midlands until, towards the end of 1975, they decided to turn professional. Meanwhile Broughton had begun to write songs. They were offered a recording contract by Phonogram Records on condition that they change their name (they were called ""Back In the Band"") and add drums and electric guitar. This prompted them to recruit Roger Kent and Mike Slamer.

Their first albums were City Boy (1975) and Dinner At The Ritz (1976). It was not until 1978, that they had their first hit with the song '5705'. The single reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.

Most of City Boy's albums were labelled and distributed by Vertigo Records, also known as PolyGram and Polydor.

Unable to secure a contract with any of the major companies, the band split up in 1982. Lol Mason formed The Maisonettes in 1982.

In the Philippines, the group was briefly popular for another song, ""Speechless"", the track from the band that played there. In 2000, Jorn Lande covered ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" with Ronni Le Tekro on guitar and Sid Ringsby on bass.

In August 2008, several City Boy albums, Book Early, Young Men Gone West, Dinner at the Ritz and the band's self-titled debut, were reissued. "

Most of their songs were written by Riff Regan (including the first two singles 'Everyone's a Winner' and 'Summer of Love') or by Riff Regan and Steve Voice. All their records were produced by Simon Napier-Bell (who was also their manager) at the IBC Studios in London.

They toured extensively throughout 1977, including a major UK tour with The Stranglers. Their third release, the single 'Animal Games', was featured on the notorious Sex Pistols edition of the British TV show So It Goes.

Their final gig was at the Marquee Club in Wardour Street on the 8th December 1977. The band broke up shortly afterwards. On leaving, Moss joined The Damned and then formed Culture Club with Boy George. Riff Regan released solo records on MCA and CBS before reverting to his real name of Miles Tredinnick and becoming a comedy writer; Steve Voice formed a new band The Original Vampires and Dave Wight following stints in Metro and Holly and the Italians reverted to his real name of Colin Wight and became an academic (recently appointed Professor of International Relations at the University of Sydney). Simon Napier-Bell went on to manage George Michael and Wham! before becoming a best selling author of rock 'n' roll books.

MCA Records released the original band's one and only vinyl album, Animal Games, in 1978.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on.

Guidry brought the name Outlaws with him when he joined(he'd been in another group that had that name). Previous to Guidry's arrival the band had been called The Rogues, then The Four Letter Words. By early 1968 O'Brien & Humberg both had left the band to get married and Frank O'Keefe came in on bass. In the spring of 1968 the group's first manager, Paul D., brought them to Epic Studios in NYC to record an album which was never released after the band and the producer of the album had a falling out. Guidry left at this point after differences with the manager. The group headed back to Tampa, then got another deal to go to Criteria Studios in Miami to record another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released and Gernhard vanished soon after. Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time to play bass while O'Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O'Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herb Pino began playing guitar as well as singing by this time. Drummer Monte Yoho came in that same year to sub for Dix.

In early 1970, the Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul D. (Ped-Dyn. Productions.) The Dave Graham Group's Union leader was Monte Yoho but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O'Keefe, Dave Dix, Billy Jones and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They recorded a cover of the Doors ""Five to One"" as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This grouping disbanded in the Spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Paul D. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so not sure if they would continue.

In 1971 Henry Paul, a singer & guitarist who was born in New York but grew up in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in Greenwich Village NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O'Keefe. In 1972 Hughie Thomasson, himself returned from a brief spell in New York where he'd been backing up folksinger Milton Carroll, joined up with Paul, Yoho and O'Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws

Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971 & 1972, returned from a stint in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band's first infamous guitar trio later dubbed ""The Florida Guitar Army"". O'Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973-74. Buzzy Meekins and another bassist named Rick stood in until he was able to return. In 1974 Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for The Outlaws. Alan Walden(brother of Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden) was told of the group by Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager.

The band was the first act signed to Arista Records under Clive Davis. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd in Columbia, South Carolina. At the end of Lynyrd Skynyrd's set, lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant said from the stage: “If you don’t sign the Outlaws, you’re the dumbest music person I’ve ever met—and I know you’re not.” 

The Outlaws' earliest well known songs were ""There Goes Another Love Song"" and ""Green Grass and High Tides"", both from their 1975 self-titled debut album. Their 1981 cover of ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky"" from the album Ghost Riders was their biggest single chart success, reaching #31 on the Billboard ""Pop Singles"" chart.

The history of Starcastle goes back to 1968, when Steve Hagler (guitar), Mike Castlehorn (Drums) and Paul Tassler (bass guitar) formed ST. JAMES, a cover band that had some success playing in local pubs and bars. Soon after Herb Schildt joined the band and with a keyboardist they were ready for greater things, but tragedy hit them, Mike Castlehorn died in a car accident and was replaced by Steve Tassler.

After years of practicing and writing new material, Starcastle released their eponymous debut in 1976, and even when they were cataloged as YES clones, the band was well received in USA and Canada.

Despite having several lineup changes, Starcastle managed to release three more albums, ""Fountains of Light"" (1977), ""Citadel"" (1977) and the mainstream oriented ""Real to Reel"" in 1978, after that, the band disbanded, but had several reunions for short periods.

In 2004 the band decided to make a tribute for Gary Strater who had pancreatic cancer since 2003. They performed together with Gary (this was his last performance with the band). Gary passed away a year later, but not before recording enough material for their last record called ""Song of Times"" that was released in 2007."

Player was formed in 1977 by Englishman Peter Beckett, who came to the United States after the demise of his popular English band Paladin, along with J.C. Crowley. He was soon joined by Ronn Moss and John Friesen. After many rehearsals and songwriting sessions, Player was born.

In January 1978, Player had an international number one hit with their first single: ""Baby Come Back"", which was co-written and sung by Beckett. The self-titled album went platinum and the band toured extensively. These classic outings included Boz Scagg's Down Two Then Left Tour, Eric Clapton’s Slowhand Tour, Heart's Dog & Butterfly Tour and Kenny Loggin's Nightwatch Tour, playing always to sold out arena audiences. Four albums followed rendering four more top forty singles, including ""This Time I'm In It For Love"", which reached number ten on Billboard's chart.

Peter Beckett has written hit songs for many artists including: Heart, Olivia Newton-John, Kenny Rodgers, The Temptations, Poco, Janet Jackson, The Commodores, Cliff Richards, Survivor, Grace Slick, and more recently Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" fame.

Between the years 1989-1997, Peter was a featured member of The Little River Band and has written several singles for them.

Peter has also garnered many movie credits as artist, producer and/or writer.  These include: The Karate Kid, Two of a Kind, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Major League, St Elmo's Fire (Grammy Nomination), Frankie and Johnny, Rock Star, Terminator 3, Basic, Beyond Borders, Life or Something Like It, Dirty Dancing 2 and Transformers to name a few.

In the mid eighties, bassist Ronn Moss took on another career as Ridge Forrester, the male lead in the daytime CBS TV drama ""The Bold And The Beautiful"", a role he played for 25 years. He has also made many feature movies.

Player started performing again in the year 2003, always featuring an all star line-up, which has included at various times members of The Cars, REO SpeedWagon, Foreigner and Little River Band. Peter and Ronn were part of Sail Rock 2013 and toured the US with Christopher Cross, Orleans, Firefall and many other great musicians.

Relf assumed the role of guitarist, and they were joined by bassist [a=Louis Cennamo], keyboardist [a=John Hawken], and vocalist [a=Jane Relf].  This lineup recorded the first self-titled album and most of the second album, Illusion (1971).  A rapid series of personnel changes followed.  Guitarist and composer [a=Michael Dunford] first appeared on Illusion.  Before his departure from the band Hawken recruited new vocalist [a=Annie Haslam].  By 1972, when the Renaissance recorded their third album, [m=25026], none of the original members remained though McCarty still wrote music for the band.

By 1973 the lineup had stabilized with Haslam, Dunford, keyboardist [a=John Tout], bassist and vocalist [a=Jon Camp], and drummer [a=Terry Sullivan].  This lineup produced a string of relatively successful albums over the remainder of the decade.  They had one Top 10 single in the U.K., ""[m=25018]"", from the album [m=24998] (1978).

By 1980 Sullivan and Tout departed leaving Haslam, Dunford, and Camp as the stable core of the group with various other musicians coming and going through the early and mid 1980s.  The group released two albums, [m=66421] (1981) and [m=66404] (1983) which were not well received by either fans or critics.  Renaissance went into the studio to record a further album but found themselves without a label willing to release it.  Material for this album as well as discarded tracks from the sessions for the previous three releases finally saw the light of day as [m=25034] in 1997.  

Renaissance broke up in 1987 but both Michael Dunford and Annie Haslam tried to revive the name with different musicians in the 1990s.  Haslam, Dunford, Tout, and Sullivan did reunite and released a studio album, [m=422543], in 2001, and a live album, [m=596367], in 2002.  In 2009 Haslam and Dunford reformed Renaissance for a 40th anniversary concert tour.  [a=Rave Tesar], who replaced John Tout on keyboards for the 2001-02 tour and [a=David J. Keyes], the bassist from the same tour, also rejoined the band.  Two new members were also added to the lineup, keyboardist [a=Tom Brislin] and drummer [a=Frank Pagano].

Live CDs and DVDs from their 2011 tour were released, with [a=Jason Hart] replacing Tom Brislin on keyboards.  In 2013 their first new studio album in 12 years, [m=569466] was released.  It was the last album to feature Michael Dunford, who died in November, 2012."

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015.

They were chronicled in [a=Henrik Bech Poulsen]'s book 77: The Year of Punk and New Wave. Billboard credited them with paving the way for 1980s new romantic acts.

The band was formed in November 1976 by vocalist Rikki Sylvan (whose real name was Nicholas Condron) and guitarist Valac Van Der Veene, joined shortly afterwards by keyboardist Nik Weiss, bassist Andy Prince (also called Andy Prinz) and drummer Nigel Bartle. In May 1977, Bartle was replaced by Hugh Inge-Innes Lillingston. The band were managed by Frank Case.

Although the band seemed to be working class (a stereotypical characteristic for punk musicians), they had a middle-class (or even upper-class) upbringing. Sylvan lived in Kensington and went to public school, Prince lived with his parents in Addlestone and Weiss went to public school. The son of a lieutenant commander, Inge-Innes Lillingstone lived in Thorpe Hall, near Tamworth, and attended Eton School. 
The band's official live concert debut was at The Man in the Moon in Chelsea on 28 May 1977.

A single called Oundle RocSoc, containing early versions of ""City of the Damned"" and ""Dorian Gray"") was recorded at Tin Pan Alley Studio and released in May 1977. In the late summer of 1977, the band signed with DJM Records, and a new, re-recorded version of ""City of the Damned"" was released as a single in November.

In January 1978, the band released the single ""Loaded"", backed with a cover of the Rolling Stones' song ""Street Fighting Man""). That May, ""Twilight Jack"" was produced as a 7"" acetate but never made it's way to a full release. Shortly afterwards, they released their 4 Minute Warning album, which according to one critic was ""roundly ignored"". While the band were recording a second album at the CBS studio in London, they were dropped by DJM and split up shortly afterward. Their records generally received bad reviews in the British press.

Later, Sylvan mixed Gary Numan's albums Replicas (with Numan's previous band Tubeway Army) and The Pleasure Principle. He also released a solo album, The Silent Hours, and then formed a band called 3AM with Steve Wilkin (guitar) and Derek Quinton (drums), both ex-members of Neo. Van Der Veene became a journalist, interviewing new wave icons. Prince joined Random Hold, but also worked with his ex-bandmate Sylvan in the 1980s."

A group of session musicians and singers were gathered in a London studio and recorded a demo of these tracks. Three of the session musicians were then asked to form the beginnings of a band, and with that John Richardson, Alan Williams and Pete Arnesen were the start of The Rubettes. John got some musician friends to round out the group, with Mick Clarke, Bill Hurd and Tony Thorpe making the original group of six. 

Pete Arnesen, the only American of the group, was the first to part ways. Later, Bill Hurd chose to pursue a solo career, cutting the band to four. Tony Thorp left the band in 1979, and the final three continued to make music together. 

In 1982, the band re-formed to tour on the wave of nostalgia. This time, Alan Williams and Mick Clarke were joined by Bill Hurd and Alex Bines, once Hurd's Milkman, completed the revised line up on drums. Mick Clarke was replaced by Steve Kinch 1987-1991 and Trevor Holliday 1991-1993. c.1992: the line up was Alex Bines, Alan Williams, Trevor Holliday and Bill Hurd. 

In 1999, the re-formed line up split again, forming two ""competing"" Rubettes groups, one lead by Bill Hurd and the other by Alan Williams. This resulted in two separate entities, who took distinct names following a court order, making The Rubettes featuring Bill Hurd and The Rubettes feat. Alan Williams. William's group consists of Alan Williams, John Richardson, Mick Clarke, and Mark Haley. 

Sidenotes: 
Of the Original Rubettes line-up only John Richardson, Alan Williams and Pete Arnesen participated in the recording of ""Sugar Baby Love"" with the falsetto lead vocal performed by [a=Paul Da Vinci] (legal name: Paul Prewer). With contractual obligations preventing Prewer from joining the band when it was formed, he never toured with the original band. He later featured with Hurd, Bines and the rest in this Rubettes formation from 2000 until 2006, when he left for personal reasons and is replaced by George Bird.

The band name was born from the interest in jewel-based names like ""Diamonds,"" and one of Thorpe's girlfriends owned a purplish-red colored Mini which she affectionately called ""Ruby.""

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles.

Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

He started out for a brief period of time as a glam rocker, but then tried out for a solo career with his first album [i]Chestnut Street Incident[/i] released by former [a=David Bowie] manager, [a=Tony DeFries] on the Mainman (division of MCA) label. 
That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs. It was also the label's idea to release the album under the name [b]Johnny Cougar[/b] which Mellencamp did not approve of.
It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks. 
Following that was [i]Uh-huh[/i] which would be his first release under the moniker [b]John Cougar Mellencamp[/b]; the name he would stick by until he gradually dropped the ""Cougar"" and just went by his given name [b]John Mellencamp[/b].

Notable instruments: Projectron - A device built by Alan Parsons as an analog sample playback device, similar in general concept to a Mellotron. The Projectron consisted of a 24-track tape machine, with each playback channel routed to a voltage controlled amplifier; each VCA was in turn gated by a key of an attached keyboard. The device was used on the albums I Robot, Pyramid, and The Turn of a Friendly Card. But preparing tapes was a cumbersome process and the device was maintenance-intensive, so as soon as a Fairlight CMI became available to Parsons, he switched his sampling activities to that. Parsons scrapped the Projectron sometime after 1980, and no photos of it are known to have survived."

The Southern rock group was rehearsing in its early days and found a keychain with Tucker's name on it in an old warehouse in Spartanburg, S.C. In an interesting twist, Tucker was also a musician. ""Marshall was blind since birth but amazingly could play the heck out of the piano,"" the band noted on social media. ""He always said his talent was simply God-given. He tuned pianos in South Carolina for decades. We are thankful for Mr. Marshall Tucker and the life he lived."""

Slade rose to prominence during the glam rock era of the early 1970s. With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.

The group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.

While Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, ""the one we kept returning to was Slade,"" and ""we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style"". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used ""every cheap trick in the book"", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song ""When the Lights are Out"" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.

After Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name."

They were formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970.

Among the many fans of the band were acts as diverse as The Damned, Vic Reeves, Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, Spiritualized, Julian Cope, The Adverts, The Skids and Simple Minds. The Sex Pistols supported them, so did The Jam and Joy Division. They were the first to combine the avant-garde approach of The Velvet Underground with a distinctly European aesthetic. The blue hair, exotic stage-names, the lyrical themes of urban decay, political propaganda, mind control and madness were all taken up by the punk bands who followed in their wake. The Doctors Of Madness were trailblazers, pioneers, adventurers…pushing the boundaries of rock music and theatre to see how far it would go before it bust. What happened after them was due, in no small part, to what they achieved in 3 short years.

They were chronicled in [a=Henrik Bech Poulsen]'s book 77: The Year of Punk and New Wave. Billboard credited them with paving the way for 1980s new romantic acts.

The band was formed in November 1976 by vocalist Rikki Sylvan (whose real name was Nicholas Condron) and guitarist Valac Van Der Veene, joined shortly afterwards by keyboardist Nik Weiss, bassist Andy Prince (also called Andy Prinz) and drummer Nigel Bartle. In May 1977, Bartle was replaced by Hugh Inge-Innes Lillingston. The band were managed by Frank Case.

Although the band seemed to be working class (a stereotypical characteristic for punk musicians), they had a middle-class (or even upper-class) upbringing. Sylvan lived in Kensington and went to public school, Prince lived with his parents in Addlestone and Weiss went to public school. The son of a lieutenant commander, Inge-Innes Lillingstone lived in Thorpe Hall, near Tamworth, and attended Eton School. 
The band's official live concert debut was at The Man in the Moon in Chelsea on 28 May 1977.

A single called Oundle RocSoc, containing early versions of ""City of the Damned"" and ""Dorian Gray"") was recorded at Tin Pan Alley Studio and released in May 1977. In the late summer of 1977, the band signed with DJM Records, and a new, re-recorded version of ""City of the Damned"" was released as a single in November.

In January 1978, the band released the single ""Loaded"", backed with a cover of the Rolling Stones' song ""Street Fighting Man""). That May, ""Twilight Jack"" was produced as a 7"" acetate but never made it's way to a full release. Shortly afterwards, they released their 4 Minute Warning album, which according to one critic was ""roundly ignored"". While the band were recording a second album at the CBS studio in London, they were dropped by DJM and split up shortly afterward. Their records generally received bad reviews in the British press.

Later, Sylvan mixed Gary Numan's albums Replicas (with Numan's previous band Tubeway Army) and The Pleasure Principle. He also released a solo album, The Silent Hours, and then formed a band called 3AM with Steve Wilkin (guitar) and Derek Quinton (drums), both ex-members of Neo. Van Der Veene became a journalist, interviewing new wave icons. Prince joined Random Hold, but also worked with his ex-bandmate Sylvan in the 1980s."

The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Greenfield's keyboards. Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Cornwell.

Ellis left the band in 2000, passing the reins to guitarist [a629600]; when Roberts left the group in 2006 over disagreements during the recording of Suite XVI, Warne was promoted to lead vocalist also, rerecording the tracks already recorded by Roberts alongside Burnel.

Jet Black started experiencing health issues in 2007 that caused him to miss gigs; technician [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4478856-Ian-Barnard-2]Ian Barnard[/url] played in such instances. Black's live role was lessened in the 2013 tour, with [a4000000] playing the first halves of UK gigs and solely playing US gigs. Black played no gigs following March 2015, officially retiring in 2018; Macaulay's role as Black's replacement was officiated in 2016.

Born Derby, England 27 January 1944.
Died Nuremberg, Germany 2 December 2004.
Father of [a1169520] and [a1169522]

As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

Richard Kerr, a renowned British composer and songwriter, emerged as a significant figure in the music world through his collaboration with American lyricist Will Jennings. Together, they crafted some of the most memorable hits of the 1970s and 1980s. Kerr's journey in music began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period marked by his work with artists like Peter Green, Don Partridge, and Scott English. His partnership with English led to the creation of ""Brandy,"" which, when rebranded as ""Mandy"" and performed by Barry Manilow, soared to worldwide fame.
Kerr's impact on the music industry was not limited to his songwriting. He also explored his talents as a solo artist, releasing three albums between 1976 and 1982, which showcased his versatility and depth as a musician. His work encompassed a range of styles, appealing to a broad audience and earning him critical acclaim.
His contributions extended beyond his solo work, as he was instrumental in shaping the careers of other artists. The songs he wrote were performed by a variety of influential musicians, including Dionne Warwick and Helen Reddy. Kerr's ability to blend poetic lyricism with captivating melodies made his compositions timeless classics. His songs garnered multiple Grammy Award nominations and sold over 40 million records worldwide. "

In his youth, he marched as a lead soprano bugle soloist in a drum and bugle corps: [a9280684] of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Influenced by bebop, he started his professional career in the early 60s, and recorded his first album in 1966 (not released until 1968).

In 1971 he released the first Return to Forever album, and the band went from making Latin American acoustic and electronc music to a more Jazz Rock oriented approach during the decade.

The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.

After a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. [a=Paul Haslinger] replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son [a=Jerome Froese] in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own [l=TDI Music] label (later renamed [l=Eastgate]), TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate—father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories—but the group's artistic direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members."

Guidry brought the name Outlaws with him when he joined(he'd been in another group that had that name). Previous to Guidry's arrival the band had been called The Rogues, then The Four Letter Words. By early 1968 O'Brien & Humberg both had left the band to get married and Frank O'Keefe came in on bass. In the spring of 1968 the group's first manager, Paul D., brought them to Epic Studios in NYC to record an album which was never released after the band and the producer of the album had a falling out. Guidry left at this point after differences with the manager. The group headed back to Tampa, then got another deal to go to Criteria Studios in Miami to record another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released and Gernhard vanished soon after. Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time to play bass while O'Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O'Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herb Pino began playing guitar as well as singing by this time. Drummer Monte Yoho came in that same year to sub for Dix.

In early 1970, the Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul D. (Ped-Dyn. Productions.) The Dave Graham Group's Union leader was Monte Yoho but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O'Keefe, Dave Dix, Billy Jones and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They recorded a cover of the Doors ""Five to One"" as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This grouping disbanded in the Spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Paul D. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so not sure if they would continue.

In 1971 Henry Paul, a singer & guitarist who was born in New York but grew up in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in Greenwich Village NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O'Keefe. In 1972 Hughie Thomasson, himself returned from a brief spell in New York where he'd been backing up folksinger Milton Carroll, joined up with Paul, Yoho and O'Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws

Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971 & 1972, returned from a stint in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band's first infamous guitar trio later dubbed ""The Florida Guitar Army"". O'Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973-74. Buzzy Meekins and another bassist named Rick stood in until he was able to return. In 1974 Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for The Outlaws. Alan Walden(brother of Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden) was told of the group by Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager.

The band was the first act signed to Arista Records under Clive Davis. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd in Columbia, South Carolina. At the end of Lynyrd Skynyrd's set, lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant said from the stage: “If you don’t sign the Outlaws, you’re the dumbest music person I’ve ever met—and I know you’re not.” 

The Outlaws' earliest well known songs were ""There Goes Another Love Song"" and ""Green Grass and High Tides"", both from their 1975 self-titled debut album. Their 1981 cover of ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky"" from the album Ghost Riders was their biggest single chart success, reaching #31 on the Billboard ""Pop Singles"" chart.

Began his career in the mid to late 1950's when, together with American born entrepreneur [a3695131], he pioneered rock'n'roll in Australia.  He earned the title of ""The Wild One"" from his frantic stage antics and his 1959 recording of ""Shout"" became an Australian rock'n'roll' national anthem.

Johnny O'Keefe almost single handedly established the Australian recording industry. He won over a very cynical recording company, radio stations and the Australian record buying public. During his carrer he scored 29 Top 40 hits.  He fought long and hard to promote Australian talent and to ensure that Australian artists were afforded the opportunity to record. 

He was the first Australian artist to ever make the Australian Top 40 charts, with ""Wild One"".  He was the first Australian artist to be signed by and record for a major international label - the US Liberty based label.  This gave him US sales in excess of 100,000 for ""She's My Baby"" and two No.1 hits and a No. 2 hit in Australia.

He released over 50 singles, 50 EP's and 100 albums.  He wrote and produced hits for other Australian artists; managed the careers of others; compered 4 highly successful tv programs; performed to millions around Australia; toured America, performing in 36 major cities and appeared on ""American Bandstand"" and ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" - all firsts for an Australian entertainer; entertained troops in Vietnam; was a major attraction at the 3 day Sunbury Outdoor Music Festival in 1973; and played a key role in the introduction of Australia's ""Mo"" entertainment awards.

A group of session musicians and singers were gathered in a London studio and recorded a demo of these tracks. Three of the session musicians were then asked to form the beginnings of a band, and with that John Richardson, Alan Williams and Pete Arnesen were the start of The Rubettes. John got some musician friends to round out the group, with Mick Clarke, Bill Hurd and Tony Thorpe making the original group of six. 

Pete Arnesen, the only American of the group, was the first to part ways. Later, Bill Hurd chose to pursue a solo career, cutting the band to four. Tony Thorp left the band in 1979, and the final three continued to make music together. 

In 1982, the band re-formed to tour on the wave of nostalgia. This time, Alan Williams and Mick Clarke were joined by Bill Hurd and Alex Bines, once Hurd's Milkman, completed the revised line up on drums. Mick Clarke was replaced by Steve Kinch 1987-1991 and Trevor Holliday 1991-1993. c.1992: the line up was Alex Bines, Alan Williams, Trevor Holliday and Bill Hurd. 

In 1999, the re-formed line up split again, forming two ""competing"" Rubettes groups, one lead by Bill Hurd and the other by Alan Williams. This resulted in two separate entities, who took distinct names following a court order, making The Rubettes featuring Bill Hurd and The Rubettes feat. Alan Williams. William's group consists of Alan Williams, John Richardson, Mick Clarke, and Mark Haley. 

Sidenotes: 
Of the Original Rubettes line-up only John Richardson, Alan Williams and Pete Arnesen participated in the recording of ""Sugar Baby Love"" with the falsetto lead vocal performed by [a=Paul Da Vinci] (legal name: Paul Prewer). With contractual obligations preventing Prewer from joining the band when it was formed, he never toured with the original band. He later featured with Hurd, Bines and the rest in this Rubettes formation from 2000 until 2006, when he left for personal reasons and is replaced by George Bird.

The band name was born from the interest in jewel-based names like ""Diamonds,"" and one of Thorpe's girlfriends owned a purplish-red colored Mini which she affectionately called ""Ruby.""

Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1994 (Performer).

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

In the Evacuation of East Prussia in early 1945, in harsh winter conditions, his mother first had to flee with the baby boy from the advancing Soviet troops. In 1948, the two also fled from Arnstadt in the East German Soviet occupation zone to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song ""Renegade"" on the album Steppenwolf Seven). Located in the British occupation zone, teen aged Joachim, suffering from eyesight problems, listened to music broadcast by the British Forces Broadcasting Service before his family moved to Canada in 1958.

In 1965, he joined a blues rock and folk music group named The Sparrows (later known as [a407730]), which had moderate success in Canada before moving to California, augmenting its line-up and changing its name to Steppenwolf in 1967. With music that pioneered hard rock and heavy metal, Steppenwolf had international success with songs such as ""Born to Be Wild"", ""Magic Carpet Ride"", ""Monster"", ""The Pusher"", and ""Rock Me"". This was multiplied by the use of ""Born to Be Wild"" and ""The Pusher"" in the 1969 movie Easy Rider.

In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970's. Though often referred to as ""The Carpenters,"" their name on official releases and press materials was ""Carpenters."" During a period in the 1970's when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time.

Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, their parents decided to move the family west to Los Angeles, California. Richard and Karen originally played jazz, with Karen having an interest in playing the drums. They were briefly known as Spectrum and then Carpenters, where they then recorded for a small label, [l=Magic Lamp Records]. In their move West, they met Lou Adler who introduced them to [a=Herb Alpert], who signed them to his label, [l=A&M Records] in 1969.

While Richard penned compositions with writing partner, [a=John Bettis], many of the duos' hits were written by others and some were cover versions of established hits for other artists, such as [a=The Beatles] and Motown's, [a=The Marvelettes]. Their 1973 album, ""Now and Then."" B-side consists of a 9-song medley of 60's hits recorded like a radio show.

Carpenters' melodic pop, produced a record-breaking run of hits on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen #1 hits on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles (including their #1 hits). To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units.

During their 14-year career, Carpenters recorded 11 albums, five of which contained top 10 singles (""[m=84990],"" ""[m=84975],"" ""[m=84966],"" ""[m=85055]"" and ""[m=85013],"") thirty-one singles, five television specials, and one short-lived television series. They toured the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Belgium. Their recording career ended with Karen's death in 1983 from cardiac arrest due to complications of anorexia nervosa. Extensive news coverage of the circumstances surrounding her death increased public awareness of the consequences of eating disorders. "

John Otway, self-proclaimed as 'Rock and Roll's Greatest Failure', began his assault on the music industry in the mid-1970's in partnership with one 'Wild Willy' Barrett. They reached Number 27 in 1977 with the single 'Cor Baby, That's Really Free' but Otway's most remembered for accidentally crushing his 'crown jewels' on an amplifier whilst performing a cover of the Bob Lind song 'Cheryl's Going Home' live on the BBC's 'Old Grey Whistle Test'. Aside from numerous 'on/off' stints with Barrett he has also collaborated with Attila The Stockbroker and has gained a hardcore following performing as a solo artist and also with his 'Big Band'. Some 25 years after the 'Hit' he achieved his second (and highest charting) hit with 'Bunsen Burner' (straight in at Number 9) which was achieved via a Social Media campaign and the incredible support of his fan base. In 2013 Otway premiered his biopic 'Otway - The Movie' at the Odeon, Leicester Square, which was received with critical acclaim by the media. Ever the one for clever ways to sell his records Otway has tried them all (with varying degrees of success and failure) from releasing singles without vocals to circulating discs with counterfeit WEA labels to using the sleeves as free entry to gigs. Add to this the huge deposit paid (and lost) to hire a jet to take his fans on a World Tour that never got off the ground and two autobiographies and you have a remarkable career of more than 40 years that defies belief!

He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

There, he sang gospel music on local radio and put together a bar band to play venues as well as radio programs such as the Houston Jamboree and Louisiana Hayride.

In the 1950s, as the rockabilly component of rock-n-roll became evident, LaBeef began recording singles in the genre; his first, ""I'm Through"", was issued on Starday Records in 1957. In 1964, he moved to Nashville and moved to a more solidly country style, recording singles for Columbia Records. His first genuine hit was in 1968 with ""Every Day"", which peaked at #73 on the U.S. Billboard Country charts. After moving to Plantation Records in 1969, he scored a second hit in 1971 with ""Blackland Farmer"", which charted at #67. Around this time LaBeef also starred in the horror movie The Exotic Ones. LaBeef transferred to Sun Records in the 1970s and continued releasing albums and touring widely; his popularity flagged in America but rose in Europe. The 1980s saw him sign to Rounder Records, where he released albums into the 1990s.

Brother of [a=Joe Vannelli] and [a=Ross Vannelli].
Born in Montreal, Vannelli grew up in a family headed by his cabaret-singing father and a ‘keen-eared’ mother. Instinctively drawn to jazz, drummers in particular, such as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Joe Morello, Ed Thigpen and Elvin Jones, as a child Vannelli studied drums and music theory for five years. Gino’s first foray into pop music came one afternoon as a group of young drummers stood in line, waiting to take turns to audition for a Montreal East group called the Cobras. The rite of passage involved playing a tune called “Wipeout” by the Ventures. Having never heard the song before, Gino made sure he waited to the very last, studying the parts every aspiring drummer played, or was trying to play. That afternoon, Gino came home a little later than usual from school, but as the official drummer for the Cobras. A year later, with his brother Joe holding down the keyboard chair, Vannelli headed up the Motown-influenced Jacksonville 5 (note, this is five years before the Jackson 5 recorded their first record). Along the way there were guitar and piano lessons. The urge to compose words and music followed not long after. At fourteen, Gino began his official singing career when the singer in the band fortuitously couldn’t make the high water mark in a then popular tune by a gritty Welshman, Tom Jones, called ""It’s Not Unusual"".

To add complication as well as interest to his musical affinities, Gino had fallen in love with classical music—French Impressionism, Italian Opera, and 20th century Russian composers in particular. Attending concerts given by the Montreal Symphony every last Thursday of the month for one semester, had proven to be life-changing (his 2000 release of Canto being testament). ""I seemed to have had a double standard, or at least torn between a few distinct sounds and styles,"" reflects Vannelli. ""I used to defend Charlie Watts and Ringo Starr, insisting they were part of something new and exciting to my purist, jazz-head friends. Yet, when I’d listen to Dave Brubeck’s Time Out, or Miles Davis’s Birth of the Cool, pop would suddenly plead no contest—well, at least for that moment. One Thursday afternoon at Place Des Arts, I remember hearing the Montreal Symphony playing “Daphne and Chloe” by Maurice Ravel. I walked away shaking my head, muttering to myself, ‘What was that!? I was so deeply moved—bewildered by the sounds I had just heard. It was the moment I discovered to what heights music could draw a man’s soul.""

Before his seventeenth birthday, Vannelli had signed with RCA Records of Canada, releasing a single called “Gina Bold” under the pseudonym Van-Elli. Ambitious and now bitten by the music industry bug, Gino lived on and off in New York City, making the record company and publisher’s rounds, finally ending up at the foot of the gates of A&M Records in Hollywood three years later. Gino, accompanied by his brother Joe, and down to their last five-dollar bill, made one last ditch effort to get signed before having to trek back to Montreal. Early one morning, Gino headed out to the offices of A&M Records where he waited outside the gates for any sign of company co-owner Herb Alpert. As Alpert was walking through the parking lot hours later, Vannelli ran past the gates, racing by a startled and furious security guard. Before he could be accosted he begged a slightly apprehensive Alpert for a chance to audition. Acting on a hunch, (and much to the guard’s annoyance) Herb was sympathetic, telling the young hopeful to return later that afternoon. Gino proceeded to play songs on his acoustic guitar he had recently written, including “People Gotta Move,” “Crazy Life,” “Mama Coco,” “Powerful People” and “Lady”—songs that would end up on the six albums Vannelli would record for A&M between 1974 and 1978. That very day, Gino was welcomed as a new member of the A&M family.

He is the man who introduced stream of consciousness into folk music and turned folk into classical music, and then made it cross the boundaries of Western and Eastern music. The spiritual father of the ""American primitive guitar"", Fahey turned the guitar solo into a metaphysical exercise. He set up Takoma Records in 1959 to release not only his own albums but also Leo Kottke's ""6 & 12 String Guitar"" (1971), an artist with whom he later also collaborated.

Fahey contracted the debilitating Epstein-Barr virus in 1986, which severely hampered his career for over 5 years. During this low period, he was championed by alternative artists such as Sonic Youth and Jim O'Rourke, and 'Spin' magazine included a large article on him by Byron Coley in 1994. The albums ""City of Refuge"" (Tim Kerr, 1997) and ""Womblife"" (Table Of Elements, 1997) marked his return to recording, showcasing a move into avant-garde, experimental, dissonant electric guitar music, far from his previous progressive-folk style.
 
Fahey died on February 22 2001, Salem, Oregon, USA due to complications following a heart bypass operation.

Nina was giving piano recitals after playing at her local church at an early age. Her childhood piano lessons were funded by her mother's employer and a local fund set up by her music teacher, so impressed were they by her talent.

She moved to Philadelphia aged 17, teaching piano and playing to raise the money for her studies at New York's renowned Juilliard School Of Music. To fund her family she worked in a bar in Atlantic City where she was also required to sing and built up a devoted following.

She recorded Gershwin's ""I Loves You Porgy"" which became a US Top 20 hit and transported her to a bigger stage, performing at [l280434] and the [l318621].

Her repertoire went on to embrace numerous civil rights anthems, a movement for which she was a passionate and prominent supporter. She left the US in the 1970s, moving first to Barbados, and some other places, including Africa and the Netherlands, before eventually settling in France where she died from cancer in 2003.

She won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

The first two albums were more or less instrumental, but on the third came Roger Holegård (from Neon Rose), now Future Elephants? into singing and the group thus became a more pure rock band. Cary Sharaf appeared on the album ""Don't Say No"" with Billy Squier in 1981.
At the second reunion in 2003, the group gave a number of concerts, which gave more flavor, because since then they perform more regularly. A new record was recorded and released in 2004. Also in 2006 a record was released, ""Wasa Express goes to Hollywood"". Remaining members from the original group are Åke Eriksson and Bo Hallgren.

The pair broke away to form Sweetshop, later shortened to just Sweet, with Steve Norman Priest (b. 23 February 1950, Hayes, Middlesex) on bass and [a5543814] on guitar. After releasing four unsuccessful singles on Fontana and EMI, Torpey was replaced by first [a2579185], and then Mick by Andrew David Scott (b. 30 June 1949, Wrexham, Wales) and the new line-up signed to RCA. The band were introduced to the writing partnership of Chinn and Chapman, who were to provide the band with a string of hit singles.However, the band were writing their own hard-rock numbers on the b-sides of these hits. The group's determinedly effete, glam-rock image was reinforced by a succession of Top 10 hits.

The Sweet in 1974 recorded the album Sweet Fanny Adams without the assistance of Chinn and Chapman. The album charted at number 27, but disappeared again after just two weeks. As The Sweet became more of an albums band, the hit singles began to dry up. Following a move to Polydor, they cut four albums with each release making less impact than its predecessor.

Since 1982, various incarnations of the band have appeared from time to time, with up to two of the original members in any one line-up. In 1992 two versions of the band - [a=Andy Scott's Sweet] & [A=Brian Connolly Sweet] - began regularly touring and gigging. In 1997, Brian Connolly died in hospital from a muscular disorder.

Some say they were moderately successful. Their most popular songs were '5705' and 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire'.

In the early 1970s Lol Mason, Steve Broughton, Max Thomas and Chris Dunn were playing folk music in the Birmingham area. They toured the clubs of the Midlands until, towards the end of 1975, they decided to turn professional. Meanwhile Broughton had begun to write songs. They were offered a recording contract by Phonogram Records on condition that they change their name (they were called ""Back In the Band"") and add drums and electric guitar. This prompted them to recruit Roger Kent and Mike Slamer.

Their first albums were City Boy (1975) and Dinner At The Ritz (1976). It was not until 1978, that they had their first hit with the song '5705'. The single reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.

Most of City Boy's albums were labelled and distributed by Vertigo Records, also known as PolyGram and Polydor.

Unable to secure a contract with any of the major companies, the band split up in 1982. Lol Mason formed The Maisonettes in 1982.

In the Philippines, the group was briefly popular for another song, ""Speechless"", the track from the band that played there. In 2000, Jorn Lande covered ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" with Ronni Le Tekro on guitar and Sid Ringsby on bass.

In August 2008, several City Boy albums, Book Early, Young Men Gone West, Dinner at the Ritz and the band's self-titled debut, were reissued. "

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.

Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"".

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".

After various personnel changes, the line-up for the first album, Straight from the Hip, comprised David Burton (lead vocals and guitar), Dave Taylor (formerly of Catapilla; bass and vocals), Paul Travis (guitar and vocals) and Clive Brooks (previously of Egg and The Groundhogs; drums). Lead guitar was provided on a session basis by Geoff Whitehorn, then working with Crawler, although at the time of the album's release this role had been filled by Steve Mann, subsequently with Lionheart, MSG and Sweet, who completed the final line-up. Keyboards on two tracks were by John (Rabbit) Bundrick.
Following the debut album 'Straight From The Hip' in 1977, released on Decca label during 1977, the band undertook an initial tour of the UK with Slade, followed by two European tours, covering Holland and Germany. A three week tour of Hungary, sharing the stage with top Hungarian band Piramis, followed, and the final show of this tour in Budapest had an audience of 35,000.
A third album was recorded in Los Angeles but wasn't released until 2020. They disbanded in 1979.

Guidry brought the name Outlaws with him when he joined(he'd been in another group that had that name). Previous to Guidry's arrival the band had been called The Rogues, then The Four Letter Words. By early 1968 O'Brien & Humberg both had left the band to get married and Frank O'Keefe came in on bass. In the spring of 1968 the group's first manager, Paul D., brought them to Epic Studios in NYC to record an album which was never released after the band and the producer of the album had a falling out. Guidry left at this point after differences with the manager. The group headed back to Tampa, then got another deal to go to Criteria Studios in Miami to record another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released and Gernhard vanished soon after. Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time to play bass while O'Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O'Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herb Pino began playing guitar as well as singing by this time. Drummer Monte Yoho came in that same year to sub for Dix.

In early 1970, the Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul D. (Ped-Dyn. Productions.) The Dave Graham Group's Union leader was Monte Yoho but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O'Keefe, Dave Dix, Billy Jones and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They recorded a cover of the Doors ""Five to One"" as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This grouping disbanded in the Spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Paul D. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so not sure if they would continue.

In 1971 Henry Paul, a singer & guitarist who was born in New York but grew up in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in Greenwich Village NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O'Keefe. In 1972 Hughie Thomasson, himself returned from a brief spell in New York where he'd been backing up folksinger Milton Carroll, joined up with Paul, Yoho and O'Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws

Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971 & 1972, returned from a stint in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band's first infamous guitar trio later dubbed ""The Florida Guitar Army"". O'Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973-74. Buzzy Meekins and another bassist named Rick stood in until he was able to return. In 1974 Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for The Outlaws. Alan Walden(brother of Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden) was told of the group by Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager.

The band was the first act signed to Arista Records under Clive Davis. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd in Columbia, South Carolina. At the end of Lynyrd Skynyrd's set, lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant said from the stage: “If you don’t sign the Outlaws, you’re the dumbest music person I’ve ever met—and I know you’re not.” 

The Outlaws' earliest well known songs were ""There Goes Another Love Song"" and ""Green Grass and High Tides"", both from their 1975 self-titled debut album. Their 1981 cover of ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky"" from the album Ghost Riders was their biggest single chart success, reaching #31 on the Billboard ""Pop Singles"" chart.

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

Player was formed in 1977 by Englishman Peter Beckett, who came to the United States after the demise of his popular English band Paladin, along with J.C. Crowley. He was soon joined by Ronn Moss and John Friesen. After many rehearsals and songwriting sessions, Player was born.

In January 1978, Player had an international number one hit with their first single: ""Baby Come Back"", which was co-written and sung by Beckett. The self-titled album went platinum and the band toured extensively. These classic outings included Boz Scagg's Down Two Then Left Tour, Eric Clapton’s Slowhand Tour, Heart's Dog & Butterfly Tour and Kenny Loggin's Nightwatch Tour, playing always to sold out arena audiences. Four albums followed rendering four more top forty singles, including ""This Time I'm In It For Love"", which reached number ten on Billboard's chart.

Peter Beckett has written hit songs for many artists including: Heart, Olivia Newton-John, Kenny Rodgers, The Temptations, Poco, Janet Jackson, The Commodores, Cliff Richards, Survivor, Grace Slick, and more recently Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" fame.

Between the years 1989-1997, Peter was a featured member of The Little River Band and has written several singles for them.

Peter has also garnered many movie credits as artist, producer and/or writer.  These include: The Karate Kid, Two of a Kind, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Major League, St Elmo's Fire (Grammy Nomination), Frankie and Johnny, Rock Star, Terminator 3, Basic, Beyond Borders, Life or Something Like It, Dirty Dancing 2 and Transformers to name a few.

In the mid eighties, bassist Ronn Moss took on another career as Ridge Forrester, the male lead in the daytime CBS TV drama ""The Bold And The Beautiful"", a role he played for 25 years. He has also made many feature movies.

Player started performing again in the year 2003, always featuring an all star line-up, which has included at various times members of The Cars, REO SpeedWagon, Foreigner and Little River Band. Peter and Ronn were part of Sail Rock 2013 and toured the US with Christopher Cross, Orleans, Firefall and many other great musicians.

The group was formed in San Francisco in 1967 when Johnny Ciambotti joined up with John McFee, Alex Call and Mitch Howie who were members of a group called the Tiny Hearing Aid Company. Clover's first gig was July 4 1967. They performed around the Bay Area over the next two years eventually signing with Fantasy in 1969. They recorded 2 albums and 14 single for Fantasy in the early 1970's.

Eventually an expanded line-up of the group moved to the UK in 1975 or early 1976. There they released 2 further albums, and (uncredited) backed Elvis Costello on his debut album My Aim Is True (1977). The group broke up in 1978 after returning to the US.

Some say they were moderately successful. Their most popular songs were '5705' and 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire'.

In the early 1970s Lol Mason, Steve Broughton, Max Thomas and Chris Dunn were playing folk music in the Birmingham area. They toured the clubs of the Midlands until, towards the end of 1975, they decided to turn professional. Meanwhile Broughton had begun to write songs. They were offered a recording contract by Phonogram Records on condition that they change their name (they were called ""Back In the Band"") and add drums and electric guitar. This prompted them to recruit Roger Kent and Mike Slamer.

Their first albums were City Boy (1975) and Dinner At The Ritz (1976). It was not until 1978, that they had their first hit with the song '5705'. The single reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.

Most of City Boy's albums were labelled and distributed by Vertigo Records, also known as PolyGram and Polydor.

Unable to secure a contract with any of the major companies, the band split up in 1982. Lol Mason formed The Maisonettes in 1982.

In the Philippines, the group was briefly popular for another song, ""Speechless"", the track from the band that played there. In 2000, Jorn Lande covered ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" with Ronni Le Tekro on guitar and Sid Ringsby on bass.

In August 2008, several City Boy albums, Book Early, Young Men Gone West, Dinner at the Ritz and the band's self-titled debut, were reissued. "

The group is most well known outside the US for their version of Route '66 in the Levis Jeans commercial.

The group was formed in San Francisco in 1967 when Johnny Ciambotti joined up with John McFee, Alex Call and Mitch Howie who were members of a group called the Tiny Hearing Aid Company. Clover's first gig was July 4 1967. They performed around the Bay Area over the next two years eventually signing with Fantasy in 1969. They recorded 2 albums and 14 single for Fantasy in the early 1970's.

Eventually an expanded line-up of the group moved to the UK in 1975 or early 1976. There they released 2 further albums, and (uncredited) backed Elvis Costello on his debut album My Aim Is True (1977). The group broke up in 1978 after returning to the US. Around 1976, Huey Lewis had joined this band (credited as Huey Louis) and appeared on the two final Clover albums released 1977.

New management wanted to go a different direction than Quateman. He was dropped from Columbia. 

He was picked up by RCA several years later. The magic of the first album couldn't be recreated. The following three albums did well enough, but not nearly as well as his first. The three albums were heavily produced. His first album was sparse and fit the definition of that singer/songwriter era, the next three were more corporate of the time. 

He temporarily retired from the music industry to raise his children Dylan (1987) and India Rain. 

In the 2000s, he reemerged to perform publicly for a brief period. He released the 1973 album (theoretically his second album) he worked on at Columbia, and two more albums. He published a book based on raising his daughter as a single parent.

They entered and won a number of Battle of the Bands and made several appearances on Sam Riddle's ""9th Street West"" TV dance show. As Emperor's popularity grew, the band had opportunities to share concert billing with a number of acts including Peter & Gordon, The Rolling Stones, The Righteous Brothers and later, Steely Dan.

After several personnel changes, the band changed its name to Emperor during the 70’s and continued building a strong Southern California fan base. Performing regularly to packed houses at beach area hot spots like Isadore's, Joshua's and Big Daddy's made Emperor “the band to see” and a local icon. It was inevitable that the band’s combination of tight ensemble playing, versatility, superb vocals and energetic stage show would catch the eyes and ears of the recording industry. 

Emperor signed with RCA in 1974 and recorded a number of singles, several produced by John Ryan (Styx). Soon after, the band began to seek more artistic freedom and subsequently signed with New York based Private Stock Records. In 1977 Private Stock released the highly anticipated album Emperor, which was produced by Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise (Kiss, Gladys Knight) and engineered by Warren Dewey (Boston). The band enjoyed moderate success on the national record charts and toured the U.S. and Japan. 

After over twenty years of performing, and a number of personnel changes, Emperor disbanded during the 80s. But after an extremely successful reunion concert at the Galaxy Theater in 2002, the Emperors (formerly known as Emperor) are back and delighting audiences all over Southern California. The Emperors are still regarded by many as the premier classic rock band in Southern California.

Founded in late 1965, the group achieved worldwide acclaim, initially with innovative psychedelic music, and later in a genre that came to be termed progressive rock.

Distinguished by philosophical lyrics, musical experimentation, frequent use of sound effects and elaborate live shows, Pink Floyd remains one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.

A group of session musicians and singers were gathered in a London studio and recorded a demo of these tracks. Three of the session musicians were then asked to form the beginnings of a band, and with that John Richardson, Alan Williams and Pete Arnesen were the start of The Rubettes. John got some musician friends to round out the group, with Mick Clarke, Bill Hurd and Tony Thorpe making the original group of six. 

Pete Arnesen, the only American of the group, was the first to part ways. Later, Bill Hurd chose to pursue a solo career, cutting the band to four. Tony Thorp left the band in 1979, and the final three continued to make music together. 

In 1982, the band re-formed to tour on the wave of nostalgia. This time, Alan Williams and Mick Clarke were joined by Bill Hurd and Alex Bines, once Hurd's Milkman, completed the revised line up on drums. Mick Clarke was replaced by Steve Kinch 1987-1991 and Trevor Holliday 1991-1993. c.1992: the line up was Alex Bines, Alan Williams, Trevor Holliday and Bill Hurd. 

In 1999, the re-formed line up split again, forming two ""competing"" Rubettes groups, one lead by Bill Hurd and the other by Alan Williams. This resulted in two separate entities, who took distinct names following a court order, making The Rubettes featuring Bill Hurd and The Rubettes feat. Alan Williams. William's group consists of Alan Williams, John Richardson, Mick Clarke, and Mark Haley. 

Sidenotes: 
Of the Original Rubettes line-up only John Richardson, Alan Williams and Pete Arnesen participated in the recording of ""Sugar Baby Love"" with the falsetto lead vocal performed by [a=Paul Da Vinci] (legal name: Paul Prewer). With contractual obligations preventing Prewer from joining the band when it was formed, he never toured with the original band. He later featured with Hurd, Bines and the rest in this Rubettes formation from 2000 until 2006, when he left for personal reasons and is replaced by George Bird.

The band name was born from the interest in jewel-based names like ""Diamonds,"" and one of Thorpe's girlfriends owned a purplish-red colored Mini which she affectionately called ""Ruby.""

Founded and led by singer Ian Stuart Donaldson in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, in 1976, relocating to Manchester in 1978. The band originally sported a punk look, but, at their label's urging, became skinheads during the second wave of skinheads in England. Skrewdriver became known for attracting violence at their shows and none of their Chiswick releases did very well in the UK charts. They broke up in 1979.

Donaldson re-formed the band in 1982 as an explicityly White Power National Socialist band, with an entirely new, and often-changing lineup. This new version of Skrewdriver became the musical arm of the British National Front and released as their debut album ""Hail The New Dawn"" in 1984 on the German Rock-O-Rama label. This release not only helped transform the label to a far-right position but effectively invented White Power rock and Skrewdriver quickly became a driving force behind the R.A.C (Rock Against Communism) movement.

In 1993 Ian Stuart died in a car accident, bringing an end to the band.

In 1985 The Tubes released “Love Bomb,"" which was not a commercial success and years of expensive tours left the band a half million dollars in debt.  Capitol dropped the Tubes and lead singer Fee Waybill left the band, with David Killngsworth joining as his replacement.

CBGB was the epicenter of NY punk - and other house bands such as [a=Blondie], [a=Television] and [a=Talking Heads] got Mink DeVille categorized as part of the punk/new Wave underground to which they never belonged musically. Mink DeVille's music was built on R&B, blues and 60's classic pop blended with streetwise attitudes and back alley romanticism, not unlike the sound heard in early [a=Bruce Springsteen] songs like ""Rosalita"" and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" and heard from Springsteen confreres [a=Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes] and [a=Gary U.S. Bonds], with a twist of hispano, New Orleans and Zydeco. Discovered by [l=Capitol Records] in 1977 the band recorded three albums for the label. The fresh approach to R&B classicism and rock & roll got producer legend [a=Jack Nitzsche] interested in producing the band and he is credited as being a major influence on the development of the band's sound. Hearing the band live in its early days also caught song writing legend [a=Doc Pomus]'s attention, and he offered to write with Willy DeVille. In spite of critical acclaim and praise of DeVille's writing talent, Mink DeVille didn't make it big in the US, but caught quite an audience in Europe. 

The original Mink Deville band was broken up by Willy DeVille after the first two albums, and from 1980's ""Le Chat Bleu"" recorded in Paris, he would hand-pick musicians for recording and touring under the band name. The album is often cited as the band's best out of the six studio albums.

From 1986 Willy DeVille performed under his own name.

Key band songs include ""Spanish Stroll"", ""Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl"", ""A"" Train Lady, ""I Broke That Promise"", ""Just To Walk That Little Girl Home"" and ""Love & Emotion""

The multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
No matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career.

Raised by his grandparents in Reading, MA, Simon Stokes was seen by his peers as a loner or solitary child. By the age of ten he had become a sleepwalker. His grandfather would often take Stokes to see the Harry D. Stokes Orchestra, which was his introduction to music. In his teenage years, Stokes became influenced by the blues, often listening to a local DJ named Sid Symphony and attending all-night concerts. Stokes saw Big Mama Thornton and Hank Ballard among countless others, each having an impact on him. After entering a local songwriting contest and winning the top prize, Stokes ventured to Los Angeles in his early 20s. Beginning in 1965, Stokes recorded a number of 45s under names such as the Flower Children and Heathen Angels. At the same time, Stokes became a staff writer at Elektra Records. Forming a band called the Nighthawks, Stokes and MC5 signed to Elektra on the same day.

In 1973, Stokes released his debut album, Incredible Simon Stokes & the Black Whip Thrill Band on Spindizzy Records, described by some as a psychedelic blues record in the vein of Captain Beefhart. The album's cover was reportedly the first banned album cover in the United States. Featuring S&M scenes as well as females being whipped, the controversy created a cult following for the musician, especially among biker groups. In 1977, Buzzard of Love was released. After this album, Stokes basically went underground, releasing no material for nearly two decades. In 1996, he returned to music circles by releasing Right to Fly which he did with '60s counter-culture icon Timothy Leary. In 2002, Stokes released a country-rock album titled Honky. Featuring members of the Bellrays and Wayne Kramer, the album's sound was compared to outlaw singers such as Waylon Jennings and David Allan Coe."

In 1971, Matthews recorded two solo albums on Vertigo and in 1972, under the sponsorship of former Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith, and surrounded by likeminded British semi-folkies (notably another ex-Fairporter, Richard Thompson), he formed Plainsong.

Born 7 July 1951 in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa

Terence William 'Blondie' Chaplin is a musician who first became known to international audiences through his brief stint in the early 1970s as a singer and guitarist for the Beach Boys. Chaplin was also listed as a co-producer, sang lead vocals with fellow South African musician Ricky Fataar (drummer) and composed, with Fataar, ""Here She Comes"" and ""Hold On Dear Brother"" on the twenty-third official Beach Boys album, ""Carl and the Passions - 'So Tough'"", released in 1972. He is well known in recent years as a long term backing vocalist and acoustic rhythm guitarist for the Rolling Stones.

Blondie Chaplin, along with drummer Ricky Fataar, joined the Beach Boys when original drummer Dennis Wilson suffered a hand injury which left him unable to play the drums for almost two years. For the Beach Boys, it was a period in which long-time member Bruce Johnston had departed the band, and one-time leader Brian Wilson's participation in the group was very limited. As a result, Chaplin and Fataar joined the Beach Boys as full-fledged members and not merely as backing musicians. Chaplin left the group in 1973 after a dispute with the Beach Boys' management; Fataar remained with the band until the following year.

Both Chaplin and Fataar were members of South African rock band the Flame before joining The Beach Boys. The Flame were discovered by Beach Boy Carl Wilson while performing in London. Wilson signed the band to the Beach Boys' Brother Records label and produced their self-titled album which featured soulful rock/pop songs in the vein of The Beach Boys and Badfinger. The Flame were the only band aside from The Beach Boys to record for Brother Records.

Chaplin sang lead on at least three Beach Boys songs, ""Sail On, Sailor,"" ""Leaving This Town"" and ""Funky Pretty"" (all from the 1973 album Holland). During the late 1980s Chaplin toured with The Band, replacing some of Richard Manuel's vocals and playing guitar. Chaplin was also a featured player in former Byrds men Gene Clark and Michael Clarke's new band, titled ""The 20th Anniversary Celebration of the Byrds"". Chaplin then appeared on the Jennifer Warnes albums The Hunter and The Well. Since the late 1990s and the Bridges to Babylon Tour, Chaplin has been a backing vocalist and occasional guitar player for The Rolling Stones.

Chaplin has released three solo albums, most recently Between Us in 2006."

From their ""free-rock"" beginnings in the nascent ""krautrock"" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional ""rock"" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.

Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the ""krautrock"" twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and ""freak out jamming"" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the ""Berlin School"". Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.

After a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past.

Born on 8 May 1944 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, Gadd started his recording career as [a809714] in 1960, although a succession of singles under this name (and later as Paul Monday) made little impact. In 1971, with management by [a224754], he jumped on the glam bandwagon, releasing the single ""Rock N Roll"" under the name Gary Glitter. It reached the top ten in both the UK and USA. Although his only major hit state-side, it was the first of many in the UK, under the guidance of [l364229].

Glitter's releases were, for the most part, fairly basic, but were made successful by his bravado and strutting showmanship. The hits dried up in the mid-70s, though he remained in the public eye via live performances and a 1984 comeback ""Another Rock N Roll Christmas"", as well as being sampled by (and appearing on TV with) The Timelords for their 1988 chart-topper ""Doctorin' The Tardis"". He went into semi-retirement in the 1990s, putting most of his musical energy into his annual Christmas gigs. However, his musical career ceased in 2000 after a 1999 conviction for child pornography.

On 5 February 2015, Gadd was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under the age of 13, between 1975 and 1980. He was sentenced, on 27 February, to 16 years imprisonment.

Battisti's most successful albums include ""Anima latina"" (1974), ""Una Giornata Uggiosa"" (1980) and ""Don Giovanni"" (1986). He was also a talented producer, and he worked on albums by many other Italian artists.

Tom Barlage (woodwinds, keyboards) and Willem Ennes (keyboards) played in The Keys, before evolving into the soul influenced band Soulution. When drummer Hans Waterman joined in 1969 (after leaving Cuby + Blizzards), along with the bass player and singer Peter van der Sande, the 1st line-up of Solution (now minus the extra letter ""u"") was formed. The partial change of name also determined the transition from soul to progressive music which was emerging forcefully at the beginning of the 70's. In 1971 Solution recorded in three days their debut album for EMI Bovema on their new and experimental Catfish label. The music showcased a wide variety  of influences : from John Coltrane to Frank Zappa, Soft Machine, Nucleus, Traffic and even a pinch of early Canterbury-style sound. After some gigs and appearances on Dutch TV, Guus Willemse became the new bassist and vocalist of Solution. They released their 2nd album ""Divergence"" in 1972 on Harvest label and toured in UK for two weeks supporting Badfinger and Electric Light Orchestra. But despite this the band entered a period of crisis : bass players came and went and both Ennes and Barlage had to undertake obligatory Dutch national military service. Anyway in 1974 Solution re-emerged from their crisis thanks to the well-known English producer Gus Dudgeon, who by chance had heard them on a tape. Finally the group was signed to the newly formed Rocket Records, a partnership between Elton John, Gus Dudgeon and Elton's manager John Reid. With Guus Willemse back in the ranks and the addition of guitarist Michiel Pos the quintet recorded in 1975 their 3rd album ""Cordon Blue"" at Rockfield Studios in Wales. Then the band responded with ""Fully Interlocking"" in 1977, but both albums did not do well in the UK and so in 1980 they departed from Rocket Records. In early 80s Solution released two studio album (with a sound more commercial) and a farewell 2-LP live album, after which the band split in 1983. Solution re-united for two shows in Club Panama, Amsterdam on March 19 and 20, 2006.

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there.

They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on.

Coltrane's early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1961-65) and by free jazz explorations late in his career. Extensively recorded as a leader, he appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other major figures in jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous ""Special Citation"" from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his 'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz'.

As his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.

Brother of [a=Joe Vannelli] and [a=Ross Vannelli].
Born in Montreal, Vannelli grew up in a family headed by his cabaret-singing father and a ‘keen-eared’ mother. Instinctively drawn to jazz, drummers in particular, such as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Joe Morello, Ed Thigpen and Elvin Jones, as a child Vannelli studied drums and music theory for five years. Gino’s first foray into pop music came one afternoon as a group of young drummers stood in line, waiting to take turns to audition for a Montreal East group called the Cobras. The rite of passage involved playing a tune called “Wipeout” by the Ventures. Having never heard the song before, Gino made sure he waited to the very last, studying the parts every aspiring drummer played, or was trying to play. That afternoon, Gino came home a little later than usual from school, but as the official drummer for the Cobras. A year later, with his brother Joe holding down the keyboard chair, Vannelli headed up the Motown-influenced Jacksonville 5 (note, this is five years before the Jackson 5 recorded their first record). Along the way there were guitar and piano lessons. The urge to compose words and music followed not long after. At fourteen, Gino began his official singing career when the singer in the band fortuitously couldn’t make the high water mark in a then popular tune by a gritty Welshman, Tom Jones, called ""It’s Not Unusual"".

To add complication as well as interest to his musical affinities, Gino had fallen in love with classical music—French Impressionism, Italian Opera, and 20th century Russian composers in particular. Attending concerts given by the Montreal Symphony every last Thursday of the month for one semester, had proven to be life-changing (his 2000 release of Canto being testament). ""I seemed to have had a double standard, or at least torn between a few distinct sounds and styles,"" reflects Vannelli. ""I used to defend Charlie Watts and Ringo Starr, insisting they were part of something new and exciting to my purist, jazz-head friends. Yet, when I’d listen to Dave Brubeck’s Time Out, or Miles Davis’s Birth of the Cool, pop would suddenly plead no contest—well, at least for that moment. One Thursday afternoon at Place Des Arts, I remember hearing the Montreal Symphony playing “Daphne and Chloe” by Maurice Ravel. I walked away shaking my head, muttering to myself, ‘What was that!? I was so deeply moved—bewildered by the sounds I had just heard. It was the moment I discovered to what heights music could draw a man’s soul.""

Before his seventeenth birthday, Vannelli had signed with RCA Records of Canada, releasing a single called “Gina Bold” under the pseudonym Van-Elli. Ambitious and now bitten by the music industry bug, Gino lived on and off in New York City, making the record company and publisher’s rounds, finally ending up at the foot of the gates of A&M Records in Hollywood three years later. Gino, accompanied by his brother Joe, and down to their last five-dollar bill, made one last ditch effort to get signed before having to trek back to Montreal. Early one morning, Gino headed out to the offices of A&M Records where he waited outside the gates for any sign of company co-owner Herb Alpert. As Alpert was walking through the parking lot hours later, Vannelli ran past the gates, racing by a startled and furious security guard. Before he could be accosted he begged a slightly apprehensive Alpert for a chance to audition. Acting on a hunch, (and much to the guard’s annoyance) Herb was sympathetic, telling the young hopeful to return later that afternoon. Gino proceeded to play songs on his acoustic guitar he had recently written, including “People Gotta Move,” “Crazy Life,” “Mama Coco,” “Powerful People” and “Lady”—songs that would end up on the six albums Vannelli would record for A&M between 1974 and 1978. That very day, Gino was welcomed as a new member of the A&M family.

Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970's. Though often referred to as ""The Carpenters,"" their name on official releases and press materials was ""Carpenters."" During a period in the 1970's when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time.

Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, their parents decided to move the family west to Los Angeles, California. Richard and Karen originally played jazz, with Karen having an interest in playing the drums. They were briefly known as Spectrum and then Carpenters, where they then recorded for a small label, [l=Magic Lamp Records]. In their move West, they met Lou Adler who introduced them to [a=Herb Alpert], who signed them to his label, [l=A&M Records] in 1969.

While Richard penned compositions with writing partner, [a=John Bettis], many of the duos' hits were written by others and some were cover versions of established hits for other artists, such as [a=The Beatles] and Motown's, [a=The Marvelettes]. Their 1973 album, ""Now and Then."" B-side consists of a 9-song medley of 60's hits recorded like a radio show.

Carpenters' melodic pop, produced a record-breaking run of hits on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen #1 hits on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles (including their #1 hits). To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units.

During their 14-year career, Carpenters recorded 11 albums, five of which contained top 10 singles (""[m=84990],"" ""[m=84975],"" ""[m=84966],"" ""[m=85055]"" and ""[m=85013],"") thirty-one singles, five television specials, and one short-lived television series. They toured the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Belgium. Their recording career ended with Karen's death in 1983 from cardiac arrest due to complications of anorexia nervosa. Extensive news coverage of the circumstances surrounding her death increased public awareness of the consequences of eating disorders. "
