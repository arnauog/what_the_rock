Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formerly Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. When playing live, the band makes prominent use of improvisation and vocal harmonies. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel.

In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light.

In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music such as the lovely “Gone Beyond” and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz.

Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest.

Hardcore punk band from Chicago, IL, commonly referred to as AOF.  Started out as a 4 piece, adding guitarist Dorian Tajbakhsh in late 1983.  They disbanded in 1985 after frontman Vic Bondi decided to move to Massachusetts.  Their 2nd LP was released posthumously in 1987.  In 1991, AOF reunited for a European tour.  In 2010, it was announced that the original band had reunited and were planning to record.

Articles of Faith was noted for its musicianship and very left-wing political lyrics, although the band moved away from politics later on and focused on more personal issues.  They also had a long-running feud with another Chicago band, [a=The Effigies].

Big Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit. The band's lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career.  They booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands."

Phil Vane (vocals), Dean Jones (vocals), Pete Hurley (guitar), Jerry Clay (bass) and 'Pig Killer' (drums) formed Extreme Noise Terror back in 1985 in Ipswich, England as a heavy Hardcore Punk band.
This lineup released the Radioactive Earslaughter split album with Chaos UK
Jerry Clay was soon replaced by Mark Gardener (Sarcasm)
Pig Killer quit and was replaced by Mick Harris (Napalm Death)
This lineup recorded the 'Holocaust In Your Head' album. however this version was never released as internal disharmony lead to the eviction of Mick Harris - Replaced by Stick (Doom) - The album was re-recorded with the new lineup and released on vinyl
Mark Gardener was evicted and replaced by Pete Nash (Doom)
Phil Vane was next to quit and was replaced by Spit
Spit's stay was short and he was replaced by the returning Vane
Pete Nash quit and was replaced by Mark Bailey (Filthkick)
The lineup of Jones/Vane/Hurley/Stick/Bailey proved the most stable in the bands volatile history - Recordings by this lineup included Peel Session No3, Phonophobia, a re-recording of 'Holocaust In Your Head' (Released on CD) plus various tracks recorded for compilation albums

The collaboration with KLF was the beginning of the end for ENT as a Punk band - During this period ENT stopped working on their own material - When KLF 'retired' ENT had no money to continue and no new material to record - This lead to the band merging with Dean Jones side project Raw Noise - Stick was replaced by Raw Noise drummer (and original ENT drummer) Pig Killer, Ali Firouzbakht joined on lead guitar.

The style of ENT's music began to change as they attempted to write material which would make money instead of the crust/grind style they were known for - The new material was slower and borrowed heavilly from bands such as GISM, Ministry and Pitch Shifter - The 'Witness To The Persecution' tour of Germany previewed this new style for the first time and was not well received by the fans
The new sound combined with internal disharmonies lead to the departures firstly of Bailey (replaced by Lee Barrett of Disgust) and later of Hurley (who was not replaced)

From this point on ENT became a death metal band bearing little resemblence either in style or lineup to it's roots in hardcore punk as members of Cradle of Filth and Napalm Death joined with Extreme Noise Terror to create the reborn group that would release ""Damage 381"" in 1997. 

From mid 2010's the band started to release vinyl closer to what fans consider their true sound, with releases such as the Hatred and the Filth EP,  a split EP with Japanese band Slang, and a full length release, that sounded closest to their original sound for a long time.

Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

5125,8231,137827,UK,Foetus,Ache,1982,0.0,10,"['LP', 'Album', 'Limited Edition']","['Electronic', 'Rock']","['New Wave', 'Industrial']","[b]Foetus[/b] is a main solo project and 'one-man band' of Australian polystylistic composer, multi-instrumentalist, experimental sound artist and producer [a=J.G. Thirlwell]. Jim Thirlwell conceived the basic Foetus concept when he relocated to London in 1978. He composed everything and recorded all instruments himself, handling the entire production, even drawing illustrations and designing artworks, but for each album, he would invent a new 'band' with a word 'foetus' in a deliberately profane/offensive name. The debut single, [m1114188] 7"", was released in 1981 through Thirlwell's own label [l=Self Immolation]. Soon after, Thirlwell adopted a next moniker [i]You've Got Foetus On Your Breath[/i], and produced a debut and sophomore full-length albums [m=8234] and [m=8231] in 1981-82.

In 1984, Thirlwell permanently relocated to New York City, and ever since he had been closely associated with a 'local' (and internationally renowned) avant/industrial/fringe/free improv underground NYC scene. The next two albums, [m=8216] (1984) and [m=8240] '85, were again arranged, performed and produced solely by J.G. Thirlwell, and released under [i]Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel[/i] alias. The concept was again re-invented as [i]Foetus Interruptus[/i] three years later, for the fifth album [m=8256] in 1988. All known Foetus aliases and name variations were presented on [m8264] compilation in 1989, a collection of rare b-sides and unreleased tracks.

During the eighties, Foetus was almost exclusively a solo project for Thirlwell (occasionally credited as [a=Clint Ruin]) in the studio, but live he was supported by a group of musicians from industrial/experimental bands and projects like [a=Swans], [a=Prong] and [a36134]. They would appear as simply 'Foetus' (in the later years) or yet another Foetus side-project/deviation, such as [i]Foetus Corruptus[/i] (captured live in 1988 somewhere in Europe on the 'official bootleg' [m=41027]). In November 1990, an extended configuration of the band, [i]Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe[/i], played a concert at the Manhattan's legendary [l=CBGB], which is documented on [m=41033] 2xCD, the project's second official live album, released by [l=Big Cat] in 1992.

In 1995, Foetus presented their best-known album and the only record produced by a major label, [m=8278]. It was distributed internationally, and released via [l=Columbia] in USA & Canada, [l=Rough Trade] in Germany, [l=Big Cat] in the United Kingdom, and [l=Sony Music Records] in Australia and Japan. 'Gash' was the first studio work by Foetus prominently featuring other musicians beside Thirlwell: drummer [a=Vinnie Signorelli], who already played with Foetus live on many occasions, as well as [a=Tod Ashley] (bass), [a=Marc Ribot] (guitar), and [a=Steven Bernstein] (trumpet). The band's third live album [m=8290] was recorded during [i]Rednecropolis 96[/i] tour in Europe, featuring [a=Brian Emrich] on bass, [a=William Tucker] and [a=Kurt Wolf] on guitars, [a=Rob Sutton] with keyboards & guitar, and [a=Jim Kimball] on drums.

Foetus returned five years later with a new studio album [m=8304], released by [l=Thirsty Ear] (USA) and [l=Nois-O-Lution] (Germany) in May 2001. This record marked the transition back to solo Foetus, with all instruments and production by J.G. Thirlwell. It was paired with [m=8300] remix album, featuring [a=Amon Tobin], [a=Pan Sonic], [a=Kid606], [a=DJ Food], [a=Panacea] and several others. On subsequent albums, Jim Thirlwell is responsible for all instruments and vocals, though every album features at least 3-4 tracks recorded with collaborators and guest musicians.

A few conceptual themes in Foetus discography include album titles, which are all four-letter monosyllables, and gradual introduction of color in cover artwork: the first three albums only used black, white and red, with the addition of yellow on 'Nail,' and finally full-color artworks were introduced since 'Gash.' Foetus adopted a new visual identity and style in 2004, reverting to black-white-red gamma.

Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist [a=Peter Gabriel], who left the band August 15, 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer [a=Phil Collins] who assumed lead vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist [a=Steve Hackett], two years later, saw the remaining three members (Phil Collins, keyboardist [a=Tony Banks] and bassist/guitarist [a=Mike Rutherford]) move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1996 Phil Collins left to concentrate on his solo work and other projects, leaving erstwhile bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks to forge ahead with new recruit; [a=Stiltskin] vocalist [a=Ray Wilson]. This line-up lasted for one album only (1997's [i]Calling All Stations[/i]) and Genesis soon found itself on hiatus after the poor performance and critical reaction of the new album.

In 2006 – after years of speculation – Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford reformed Genesis for the successful [i]Turn It On Again[/i] tour. A reunion involving ex-members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett remains much talked-about and unrealised.

Inducted into the [b]Rock & Roll Hall of Fame[/b] in 2010 (performer).

The band, despite playing numerous live shows and releasing a slew of 7"" singles and three full length albums, never received much attention outside of their local fanbase. Even when they were together, Harvey Milk releases were notoriously hard to find. 

It was not until years after the band's demise that their singles, as well as all three full length albums, saw re-release through various labels, most notably Relapse Records. 

While Harvey Milk invariably draws comparisons to the [a=Melvins], due to their penchant for slow, heavy riffs, the band has touched upon such artists as [a=ZZ Top], [a=Led Zeppelin] and [a=Leonard Cohen] as influences in their music. They even went so far as to perform a live show consisting of nothing but [a=Hank Williams] covers. 

They are named after [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/334950-Harvey-Milk-2]Harvey Milk[/url], San Francisco, California's first openly gay city supervisor, who was murdered in 1978.

Harvey Milk's historic core (Creston Spiers, Stephen Tanner & Paul Trudeau) reunited in 2006 to record ""Special Wishes""."

He is the man who introduced stream of consciousness into folk music and turned folk into classical music, and then made it cross the boundaries of Western and Eastern music. The spiritual father of the ""American primitive guitar"", Fahey turned the guitar solo into a metaphysical exercise. He set up Takoma Records in 1959 to release not only his own albums but also Leo Kottke's ""6 & 12 String Guitar"" (1971), an artist with whom he later also collaborated.

Fahey contracted the debilitating Epstein-Barr virus in 1986, which severely hampered his career for over 5 years. During this low period, he was championed by alternative artists such as Sonic Youth and Jim O'Rourke, and 'Spin' magazine included a large article on him by Byron Coley in 1994. The albums ""City of Refuge"" (Tim Kerr, 1997) and ""Womblife"" (Table Of Elements, 1997) marked his return to recording, showcasing a move into avant-garde, experimental, dissonant electric guitar music, far from his previous progressive-folk style.
 
Fahey died on February 22 2001, Salem, Oregon, USA due to complications following a heart bypass operation.

Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly swords and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that ""these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that."" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan ""Death to false metal"".

Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as ""Metal Warriors"", ""Manowarriors"", ""Immortals"" or ""Brothers of Metal"".

""I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?"" - Joey DeMaio, during a 2006 interview with Rock Hard Magazine.

Fighting The World (the band's fifth release) was metal's first full-digital recording

The creation of Gods Of War was not devoid of obstacles. The band was forced to delay its release when, deep into the recording sessions, Logan suffered a devastating injuring after crashing on his prized dirtbike. Logan dislocated his elbow in the accident, an injury so severe it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career. But the guitarist fought back and after months of painful rehabilitation, he boasted he has never played his instrument better. 

During Manowar's career, the band have recorded 10 studio albums; two live albums; five DVDs and countless compilations.

Manowar's many innovations include:
* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers
* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles
* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra
* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and their own guitars as well
* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions)

Manowar created Magic Circle Music.

The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist [a251808] and bass guitarist [a374278] in the year 1983. Despite many line-up changes, Megadeth is partly responsible for the popularization of thrash metal in the late 1980s. The band was also notorious for its substance abuse, a contributing factor to their continuous revolving door of band members. The group nonetheless found sobriety and a stable line-up with 1990 release [m=32937], a trend which continued until 1998 with the departure of drummer Nick Menza. During that period, the band released four studio albums, including [m=32933], which is Megadeth's most commercially successful album.

Dave Mustaine disbanded Megadeth in 2002 due to a nerve injury he had suffered on his left arm. Following a year of physical therapy Mustaine began work on what was to be his first solo album, however contractual obligations forced [m=33085] to be released under the Megadeth name, following which, Mustaine decided to reform the band in 2004. The band has since released five studio albums, but continued to have several line-up changes through 2000s and 2010s, with Mustaine remaining the only constant member. Co-founder Ellefson, who took legal actions against the band during the disbandment, rejoined in 2010 but was fired from the band in 2021.

The name Melvins came from a grocery clerk at the Thriftway in Montesano where King Buzzo served as clerk and vandal.

134825,33812,379500,UK,New Model Army,Thunder and Consolation,1989,0.0,10,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],"['Folk Rock', 'New Wave']","With their roots embedded in the early punk era, New Model Army were formed in Bradford, Yorkshire, England, in 1980, and immediately outlined their manifesto by naming themselves after the Sir Thomas Fairfax/Oliver Cromwell revolutionary army. The group was led by Justin ""Slade The Leveller"" Sullivan (b. 1956, Buckinghamshire, England; guitar, vocals), a former platform sweeper and Mars bar production-line worker, with the help of Stuart Morrow (b. 1966, Bradford, England)  on bass guitar and Phil Tomkins on drums. Within a few months, Tompkins had been replaced on drums by Rob Waddington, and this line-up remained unchanged until the summer of 1982, when Waddington left the band and was replaced by Robert ""Robb"" Heaton (b. 1962, Cheshire, England d. Nov. 4th, 2004), a former drum technician and occasional drummer for the band Hawkwind. This line-up remained together until Morrow left the band for personal reasons, during the band's ""No Rest"" tour, the day after a concert in their home town of Bradford. Which was coincidentally the day of the Bradford disaster, May 11th, 1985  He was replaced on bass in the summer by Jason ""Moose"" Harris (b. 1968).

Their brand of punk folk/rock attracted a loyal cult following, much of which shared the band's grievances towards the Tory government policies of the 80s. This was best executed on their debut album, which combined militant themes such as ""Spirit Of The Falklands"" and ""Vengeance"" (a vitriolic anthem about getting even with one's trespassers) with the haunting lament for childhood, ""A Liberal Education"". The group's championing of traditional working-class ethics saw an unexpected boost for a dying art and trade - that of the clog.

New Model Army made their first public appearance at Scamps Disco in Bradford in October 1980. After releasing singles on Abstract Records, enjoying a number 2 UK independent chart hit with ""The Price"" in 1984, they formed an unlikely alliance with the multinational EMI Records, which saw the band acquire a higher profile and a significantly increased recording budget. 

They eventually broke through to a wider audience with ""No Rest"", which peaked at number 28 on the UK singles chart in 1985 - a position they were never to beat in an impressive run of 12 UK chart singles between 1985 and 1991. With often inflammatory lyrics, the band have never compromised their beliefs for commercial gain. 

They ran into trouble with BBC Television's Top Of The Pops show for donning T-shirts with the (albeit laudable) slogan, ""Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin"". This attracted some derision from ""anarcho-punk"" traditionalists [a251960], who replied with their own motif: ""Only Stupid Bastards Help EMI"". They subsequently continued to release high-quality albums, with considerable crossover potential, always maintaining credibility with their original fanbase. 

In December 1991 the group left EMI, eventually finding a new home on Epic Records. Their first single for the label revealed few concessions to the mainstream: ""Here Comes The War"" featured a picture of a charred body, and a pull-out poster instructing the user in how to prepare a nuclear bomb. In 1994, a dance remix of ""Vengeance' was released as a protest against the Criminal Justice Bill. After a lengthy absence the band reconvened for 1998's ""Strange Brotherhood"". New Model Army's short spell with Epic ended as quickly as it started with the band preferring to self publish and go back to their roots. By 2000 their most recent studio album was ready. Named ""Eight"" it included a now familiar, though no less effective, formula and energy. They continue to release new material and tour as of 2023."

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Evolving from Cleveland's Teutonic protopunks, [a252899], Pere Ubu was formed late in 1975 by Thomas (aka Crocus Behemoth) and guitarist Peter Laughner (who died in 1977). Ubu's classic early singles, ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""Final Solution,"" oozed restless angst way before it became the domain of spoiled mallrats. By 1978's aggressive The Modern Dance and the wilder Dub Housing, Pere Ubu's subversions of rock were guided by superior musicianship and fallout from Thomas's Jehovah's Witness upbringing. Personality quirks split the band, and Thomas regrouped for three more self-indulgent albums through 1982, including the abstract stare-down of The Art Of Walking, all with some difficult sonic perversion to recommend them.

After several Ubus found themselves onstage in Thomas's Wooden Birds, the band was revived for 1988's The Tenement Year. With newfound focus, Pere Ubu unleashed the ravishing funhouse pop experiment of 1989's Cloudland, which treated mainstream textures like found sounds. The sparkling pop, dented by Thomas's unique warble, continued with the gently peculiar Worlds In Collision. But Ubu tired of the total pop concept and returned to quirkier pursuits for Story Of My Life. Tim Kerr Records picked up the ball with 1995's full-bodied Ray Gun Suitcase--a mix of Ubu's vicious rock, luscious pop and art-damaged identities--and a series of multimedia-enhanced EPs, for which Thomas programmed the codes."

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.

Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

The band originally sported a punk look, but, at their label's urging, became skinheads during the second wave of skinheads in England. Skrewdriver became known for attracting violence at their shows and none of their Chiswick releases did very well in the UK charts. They broke up in 1979.

Donaldson re-formed the band in 1982 as an explicityly White Power National Socialist band, with an entirely new, and often-changing lineup. This new version of Skrewdriver became the musical arm of the British National Front and released as their debut album ""Hail The New Dawn"" in 1984 on the German Rock-O-Rama label. This release not only helped transform the label to a far-right position but effectively invented White Power rock and Skrewdriver quickly became a driving force behind the R.A.C (Rock Against Communism) movement.

In 1993 Ian Stuart died in a car accident, bringing an end to the band.

A single from the LP was released, but failed to chart, Spirit returned the studio later that year to record their second LP titled ""The Family That Plays Together"". A single from this album titled ""I Got a Line on You"" went on to become a minor hit in the US, and was pivotal in establishing them as a commercially successful group in the 1970's. Their fourth LP, released in 1971, ""Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus."" became their best selling album and is listed in the top 500 rock albums of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine.

They changed their name to The Matches in 2002 and released 3 studio albums before going on hiatus in 2009. They have reunited every few years since, celebrating the 10-year anniversaries of each of their albums with performances and deluxe vinyl reissues.

The Locals were formed by high school students [a=Matt Esposito] (lead guitar, backing vocals), Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals), Matt Whalen (drums, percussion), and Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar). [a=Miles Hurwitz] became their manager in 2000 and played a major role in guiding their career, including acting as co-writer and producer. Esposito left after graduating and was replaced by Jon Devoto. As The Locals, the band released a 6-song demo and 3-song EP, and built up a following in the East Bay. In 2002, threatened with a copyright infringement lawsuit by [a=Yvonne Doll And The Locals], they changed their name to The Matches.

The Matches recorded and self-released their first album, [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] (2003). They signed to Epitaph Records, who re-mixed and re-released it the following year. Their second album, [i]Decomposer[/i] (2006) took their music in a more idiosyncratic direction with contributions from nine different record producers. It reached no. 18 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. Extensive worldwide touring followed over the next two years. Their third album, [i]A Band In Hope[/i], was released in March 2008 and found them shifting further away from pop-punk. It reached no. 179 on the [i]Billboard[/i] 200. San Souci left the band that July and was replaced by Dylan Rowe.

The Matches announced a hiatus in July 2009. Shortly thereafter, they self-released the digital album [i]The Matches Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title? Or Not Needed?[/i], a collection of demos and unreleased tracks. Devoto started [a=Bird By Bird], while Harris started [a=Maniac (19)], then [a=Fortress Social Club].

In 2014 the lineup of Harris, San Souci, Whalen, and Devoto reconvened to re-release [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] as a deluxe 2-LP set. A string of reunion shows resulted in the digital live album [i]10YearsEVDKTL[/i]. A new single, ""Life Of A Match / Crucial Comeback"", followed in 2015. The following year they re-released [i]Decomposer[/i], also as a deluxe 2-LP set, and again played a series of shows resulting in a digital live album, [i]Recomposer[/i].

N.O.U. presented themselves as a radical political party instead of a rock band.

Tuxedomoon was formed in San Francisco in 1977 by two electronic music students at San Francisco City College, [a=Blaine L. Reininger] (keyboards, violin) and [a=Steven Brown] (keyboards, other instruments). Brown's local theater connections supplied equipment and occasional vocalists in [a=Gregory Cruikshank] and [a=Victoria Lowe], plus more frequent contributions from singer and performance artist [a=Winston Tong]. Punk and new wave were opening up the San Francisco music scene at the time, and Tuxedomoon landed an opening slot for Devo in 1978 at around the same time they cut their first single, ""Pinheads on the Move."" Lowe quit the band before their first EP, No Tears, which featured off-and-on members [a=Michael Belfer] (guitar) and [a=Paul Zahl] (drums). Tong and Belfer departed temporarily, and Peter Principle (b. [a=Peter Dachert]) joined as a full-time member. Tuxedomoon signed to the Residents' Ralph Records in 1979, which eventually got them overseas exposure. Feeling that their ideas were more in tune with the European electronic music scene, the band toured Europe after 1980's Half Mute, for which Tong returned with filmmaker and visual artist [a=Bruce Geduldig]. After 1981's Desire, the band relocated in an artist's commune in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Within a year though they were forced to leave and moved to Brussels, to find first shelter in the Plan K. (a live p.a. club). Reininger began to branch out as a solo artist. Tuxedomoon was also hired to score a Maurice Bejart ballet, the results of which were released in 1982 as Divine. Reininger left for a solo career in 1983 and was replaced by [a=Frankie Lievaart] and horn player [a=Luc Van Lieshout]. In between side projects and scoring, the band sought an international deal for their forthcoming LP Holy Wars; it was eventually released in 1985 and became the band's biggest commercial success. Tong left the group for good that year, leaving Brown and Principle the only remaining San Francisco members; multi-instrumentalist Ivan Georgiev was hired to replenish the group's sound for 1986's Ship of Fools album and tour. Scoring work from past projects has been reissued in Belgium. Reininger, Brown, Principle and Lieshout still record together as Tuxedomoon, whilst Reininger, Brown, Principle and Tong have all recorded as solo artists.

Initially formed as a trio called ""Genesis,"" then ""Mammoth,"" in 1972 (Eddie on guitar and lead vocals, Alex on drums, Mark Stone on bass), and renamed ""Van Halen"" by David Lee Roth (ex-Red Ball Jets), who joined the band in 1973 after Mammoth had rented a PA system from him. Michael Anthony (ex-Snake) replaced Stone on bass. First demo recordings were done in 1976 by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 by Ted Templeman, and released its debut album in 1978. 

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released its final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. The band's last concert tour was 2015.

In 2019, further reunion plans were discussed, but the band ended upon the death of Eddie Van Halen on October 6, 2020.

In 1972, sequestered in a small row house in Wimbledon in South London, the Ives brothers began to create a music which they wanted to hear.  For several years they made tapes for their own amusement, never once thinking anyone else would be interested.  It wasn't really important whether anyone else was interested, and that's one of the main reasons why WOO music works so well, and why it defies all attempts at defining what ""kind"" of music it is.  It is music which delights in its own existence, and in the process, charms the listener like nothing else.  It was 1981 before anyone else suggested the world might like a listen, too, and the result was ""Whichever way you are going, you are going wrong"".  Released in the U.K. in 1982, it received rave critical reviews in the difficult to please British press.

Initially describing themselves as alternative, indie rock, lofi jazz, synth & nostalgic acoustic guitar music, the Ives brothers eventually shifted to albums described as ambient, new age, spiritual, angelic, instrumental music for meditation, relaxation & healing."
