Live achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album Throwing Copper, which sold eight million copies in the U.S. The band had a string of hit singles in the mid-1990s including ""Lightning Crashes"", which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. Their last three studio albums fared only moderately well in the U.S., but they continued to enjoy success in the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia, and Brazil.

When touring, Live has used additional musicians, including Ed Kowalczyk's younger brother Adam, British keyboardist Michael ""Railo"" Railton, rhythm guitarist Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon, and guitarist Zak Loy of Alpha Rev, Dames Violent and Mothers Anthem.

On November 30, 2009, Taylor revealed that what had initially been termed a two-year hiatus was more likely the end of the band. An acrimonious split soon occurred, with Kowalczyk leaving the band. However, Live continued with singer Chris Shinn and released the album The Turn in October 2014. Kowalczyk rejoined the band in December 2016 and in 2018 they released a new EP ""Local 717"". In 2022, Kowalcyzk, Gracey and Dahleimer announced that Guitarist Chad Taylor was fired from the band. Currently, Ed Kowalczyk is the only original member in the band."

They perform under the name ""Melvins Lite"" with Trevor Dunn on stand-up bass and under the name ""Melvins 1983"" with Dale on bass instead of drums, in reference to the early incarnation of the band circa 1983 before Dale played the drums in the band. The name Melvins came from a grocery clerk at the Thriftway in Montesano where King Buzzo served as clerk and vandal. Melvin was the most hated fellow employee and they felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.

Columbia Records quickly signed the band and released 001 in early 1999. ""Level"" turned out to be the band's only commercial hit, and Columbia dropped the band before releasing a second album.

In the late 90's Splice was consistently touring around the northeast united states. Splice played some big music festivals sharing the stage with big names such as Silverchair, Fountains of Wayne, Everclear, and Smashmouth just to name a few. Splice was played on many of the local mainstream radio stations in CT, RI, MA and New York such as 997X Radio104 and WPLR as well as many college radio stations around the country. Splice was one of the major local bands in the CT band scene in the late 90's. Splice had many different band members in the short 4 years that they were a band. Ryan Healey, the lead vocalist/songwriter was the founder and mainstay of the band. The band started as a four piece in the winter of 1996 and made a demo tape called trip freak way. The band then went through some changes in early 1997 and formed its core group that consisted of Brian Brotherton on rhythm guitar, Drew Sullivan on lead guitar, Chris Cortigiano on Drums, Liam Carberry on Bass and Russell Foley on keyboards. This version of Splice went in the recording studio in the summer of 1997 and made the first self titled ""Splice"" album which was produced by Vic Steffens of the Horizon music group. During the recording of the self titled album in late 1997 Liam left the band and was replaced with Tyler Nevins who played bass on Door, Way and Empathy on the self titled album. The band started to get a major following in the area and decided to make an EP of some new songs in the fall of 1998. This EP was called ""More Crap From Splice"" and was produced again by Vic Steffens. In early 1999 Tyler left the band and was replaced by Liam who rejoined the band. Also at this time Russ decided to leave the band. So Splice got a new drummer Josh Sobosaly and Chris took over for Russ on keyboards. In 1999 after really starting to play some much bigger shows with national artists the band decided to make a live album. The album ""Splice Live"" was released in August of 1999. The band went through some internal fights and in early 2000 everyone but Ryan left the band. At this time Russ and the original bassist from 1996 Nick rejoined the band and Angel Hitler took over the lead guitar position and Mike who was a friend of Russ joined the band on drums. The band played shows over the summer of 2000 and then disbanded for good. Ryan Healey went on to Co-found the band Sick Ticket with Dave Novak of the local CT band Siment."

These performances feature three enigmatic bald and blue characters who take the audience through a multi-sensory experience that combines theatre, percussive music, art, science and vaudeville into a form of entertainment that is like nothing else. People from all over the world, from all walks of life and from all age groups have become fans of Blue Man Group's show in New York, Boston, Chicago, Las Vegas, Orlando, Berlin, Tokyo, and Basel.

Blue Man Group is also known for its unique style of music which is played on a variety of invented instruments. Blue Man Group's 1999 debut album, AUDIO was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category. One reviewer called it ""a glorious wall of sound.""

Blue Man Group released their highly anticipated second album, ""The Complex"", which served as a bit of a departure for the enigmatic performers. The subsequent Complex Rock Tour has been hailed as “awesome musicianship enhanced by unadulterated good humor and fun” by The Chicago Sun-Times.

In addition to live shows and music, Blue Man Group has created installations, ""happenings,"" ""unusual ads,"" a number of television-specific performances for ""The Tonight Show"" (several of which were nominated for Emmy awards) and have most recently ventured into toy development.

Starting out as a hardcore band in the 1980s, they shifted to a more funk metal style and released their first album 'Lemonade and Brownies' in 1995 with little success. The band then followed up with 'Floored' in 1997 continuing the sound with the exception of a more radio friendly effort with the single 'Fly' which became an instant hit toping several charts. As a result the band made a shift in their sound towards pop rock and released '14:59' in 1999 to continued success defying the depiction of the group as a one hit wonder. The band then released their eponymous album 'Sugar Ray' in 2001 to continued success, being their final platinum selling release, followed by the moderately successful 'In The Pursuit of Leisure' in 2003. Later 'Music for Cougars' was released after a hiatus in 2009 which failed to chart.

The band released its seventh and latest effort on July 26, 2019, titled 'Lil Yachty.'"

With two albums produced by Russ Tolman, this Davis, California quartet isn't defying any laws of logic by bearing a certain stylistic resemblance to True West (not to mention the pride of Davis, Thin White Rope). The popeAlopes' quirky pop rhythms and trancey psychedelic flavors (the latter especially on a noisy cover of the Stones' ""2000 Light Years from Home"") provide An Adder's Tale with some personality; otherwise, the band's western-flavored guitar rock runs a bit on the generic side.

It's probably not due to the change in bassists, but the confident Kerosene is much better, a striking-sounding wash of layered guitar and Steven Dueker's quietly haggard vocals. While the heavy atmospherics overcome songwriting deficiencies, the popeAlopes spin echoes of U2, R.E.M. and the Psych Furs into the stew, making Kerosene a dose of the right medicine."

STEVE SULIKOWSKI - Lead Vocals, Guitar

JON BERRY - Guitar, Vocals

The Jewel Thieves are an L.A. based modern rock band.  Actually, they are more of a pop band, but they really shouldn't be classified.  Listen to their many styles and you will see why.  From the darker side, in songs such as ""Science Fiction"" and ""What Is Personal"", to the pop side of songs such as ""Hello"" and ""She's Waiting"", the Jewel Thieves sound is diverse, yet cohesive.

Though based in Los Angeles, each of the Jewel Thieves are from somewhere else.  Steve and Eric are both from Massachusetts, Jon is from Chicago, and Chad is from New Jersey.  They have been together in this formation for a little over a year.

Within that year, the Jewel Thieves caught the attention of producer [a=Eddie Kramer] (most known for his work with Jimi Hendrix, amongst many others), and recorded three songs with him.  They currently have a production agreement with Remark Music, and are currently showcasing for record labels.

With one listening, you can see that the Jewel Thieves are about songs.  Memorable songs."

3922918,0,13780912,US,The Straw Theory,The Straw Theory,1999,51.5,12,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Pop Rock', 'Alternative Rock']","Tyler founded the band with his high-schoolmates after writing and performing his own songs, while leading worship at Pure Heart Christian Fellowship's youth group and (occasionally) the congregation in Arizona. ""Bending Spoons"" was among the possible monikers the band were throwing around, before settling with The Straw Theory, or TST.

In 1998, the band went from an act on the edge…to disbanding to pursue God's calling…to receiving a recording contract in the summer. KMG Records, a record company from Nashville, had heard the track ""Joker's Wilde"" on a local Phoenix (Arizona) compilation record, liked what they heard and scheduled an audition in the living room of Tyler's home. (At the same time, another elusive song, 'Jealous Son', was released as part of the local Worthless Records' The Rage Vol. I compilation.) That audition not only influenced KMG's signing of the band, but it also impressed three very critical industry veterans - Billy Smiley (Whiteheart), Terry Taylor (Daniel Amos/DA, The Lost Dogs, The Swirling Eddies) and David Bahnsen (manager of OC Supertones, owner Davdon Artists Agency).

""I didn't know quite what to expect,"" admitted Smiley. ""Terry Taylor, David Bahnsen and myself were ushered into the vestibule of this home (with a glass of ice water for each) to see if what I had heard on a local CD matched their 'live' performance. About 16 bars into their first song, Terry and I looked at each other knowing that we were taking in a talent that just doesn't come along every day.""

Bahnsen concurred. ""In my evaluation of young talent, and in my search for bands that have a shot at success, no bigger issue is important to me than songwriting,"" he said. ""As I sat in Tyler's parents' living room and listened to the band play, I could tell that Tyler had what it will take to be a dynamic and successful songwriter. The band has a charisma and a talent that is rare to see in such young bands. I believe they have what it takes to write pop songs and create musical pieces that will move and inspire their listeners.""

""Lacking overt self-conscious stylizing and trendiness, The Straw Theory instead offers us tender glimpses of God's grace and mercy set against personal struggles of faith, all delivered in a passionate voice that defies easy categorization,"" concluded Taylor.

In the winter of '98, recording of the band's debut album began. The record was finished by the summer of '99, and the band set out on tour in the fall of the same year. Only 19 at the time, band leader Tyler noted, ""I really wasn't seeking to be unique or to sound like anybody. I was basically seeking to write good music. When I wrote the songs, I wrote them on piano in the singer-songwriter format. The songs became even more unique when they evolved into a four piece band format. My mentor in music for the last six years has been Terry Taylor of Daniel Amos,"" said Tyler. ""The first album I went nuts over was their CD Motorcycle. That was what helped fuel the passion for me to do what I'm doing now.""

After a successful string of dates opening up for the Smalltown Poets, their successful tour ended in the winter of '99. However, at the beginning of 2000, Tyler and his band mates were beginning to have some differing opinions regarding issues concerning the band. After a time of prayer and seeking God, Tyler felt it best to bring the chapter of the Straw Theory to an amicable close (the band still remains friends to this day).

Tyler went on to pursue a solo project (Chasing Happy) in 2006, followed by a new band album debut (NovaLux, including Troy Roberts as bandmate) in 2009, followed by touring until 2011 before deciding to go solo again (NovaLux's last FB posting stated that ""Tyler has relocated with his family to Nashville to pursue music as a career"").

Jake Bramante now runs a hiking blog (http://www.hike734.com) based on his experiences at Glacier National Park, Montana. His brother, Josiah, has become a radiographer who works in Fresno, California. Andy Sonsky still plays guitar during congregational worship in Phoenix."

In those early days, Charlie Lowell and Dan Haseltine were joined by [a=Matt Bronleewe] after discovering they shared similar musical tastes, and began working on various studio projects as well as performing with different college bands. In 1993, Stephen Mason was accepted into the college due to the strength of his audition piece 'Frail' (then an instrumental guitar track), and met Dan because of a Toad The Wet Sprocket t-shirt he was wearing, the two sharing an admiration for that band's unique sound. This original foursome then decided to write and record a song together purely for credit in a recording class. That song, 'Fade To Grey' became popular throughout the college, and the band performed it the 'Underground Cafe'. After the success of this performance, they decided to write more songs to add to their repertoire as well as to continue satisfying their course criteria. They also decided that if they were going to continue performing, they needed to give themselves a name. Charlie recalled a verse from 2 Corinthians 4:7 that included the phrase 'Jars of Clay' and the band decided that this would be a good way to remind themselves to stay humble. In 1994, Jars of Clay was born.

Also in 1994, Charlie suggested to the band that they enter a talent contest he had seen advertised in a CCM magazine. On April 27th, Jars of Clay performed at the Gospel Music Association Spotlight Competition, and met with great popular and critical praise. April continued to be busy as the band released its demo album ""Frail"", (which was limited to a run of 1000 and is now the most highly sought after piece of Jars of Clay memorabilia). This demo, combined with their GMA win, garnered the band a lot of record label interest, and eventually they signed with [l=Essential Records (3)], then a small, fledgling label that nevertheless had the distribution power of both Brentwood Music and Silvertone. By this stage, Matt Bronleewe had decided to leave the band and continue his studies, rather than move with the others to Nashville to record their debut album. This left a hole in the group that was filled when Charlie called an old school friend of his, Matt Odmark, and asked him if he would be interested in the spot. Matt accepted and in May 1995 they released their self-titled debut to massive critical and popular acclaim. The first single to be lifted from the album, 'Flood', became a No. 1 hit on both secular and Christian charts, helping the album go 2x Platinum, and seeing the band tour with the likes of Sting, Sheryl Crowe, Michael W. Smith and PFR.

Jars of Clay are considered to be one of the most creative and artistic bands in the US, and not only amongst Christian audiences. Though their name is not as prevalent in the secular scene as it once was, it is still associated with the very highest of production values and creative output, and the band still maintains a very loyal and dedicated fan base, and have performed all over the world, including Australia, the UK, the Philippines, and Singapore. In 2001, Jars of Clay received Honourary Degrees from Greenville College, since Dan, Charlie and Steve never finished their original degrees. The band has always been open about their Christian beliefs, but do not consider themselves to be a 'Christian' band, more a band whose members are Christians. All four men are now married and most have started families of their own. When touring, the group is expanded to include a drummer (formerly Scott Savage and [a=Joe Porter (2)], currently [a=Jeremy Lutito]) and a bassist (formerly [a=Aaron Sands], currently [a=Gabe Ruschival]), and on occasion has included string players. Jars of Clay continue to be one of the most influential bands in the CCM industry as well as maintaining a high degree of respect in the music industry in general."

Known for their effects-laden guitars and tight drum and bass grooves, Secret Sunday combines strong songwriting with moody vocal melodies and a touch of keyboards to create a unique ""avant-rock"" style. After breaking up in 2000, Secret Sunday is back together in 2024 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their acclaimed album ""Television,"" performing it in its entirety from start to finish. This album, which won Album of the Year at the 1999 Houston Press Music Awards, remains a testament to their influential sound and enduring legacy.

Television was released at the end of the millennium—just before the emergence of social media, streaming music, and smartphones—by an unlikely band of Gen Xers on the verge of either making it or breaking it in the music business. Largely a concept album, the dystopian themes and imagery of mass media disinformation and sentient technology woven throughout the lyrics and album art have seemed—in hindsight—to have foretold the post-pandemic, AI-saturated future that we find ourselves in today.

In 2000, shortly following their East Coast tour in support of the album, the band parted ways. Here are their post-departure musical journeys:

S. Wesson, Moore, and Wiggington dove headfirst into a new project called MenMechanical, which lasted until 2002—roughly a year after Wiggington left to join the military. Moore and S. Wesson moved on to join established alt-rock band Pale for several years until they went inactive in 2014. Early during that same 12-year period, Moore and S. Wesson both played with Arthur Yoria. S. Wesson was also a member of The Prodigal Sons while Moore had brief stints with 61 Cygni (with the other Wesson brother) and Casino.

Meanwhile, in the US Air Force, Wiggington (Master Sergeant, retired) kept the music going in England and Japan. He drummed for a Rush cover band with no name, rock/metal outfits The Reaping and Hai Sai Heroes, started a Nirvana cover band called Breed, and then rounded out his Okinawa tour playing reggae/beach vibes covers with Oki Vibez.

After a short time playing with 61 Cygni in 2003 (alongside Moore), J. Wesson found solace for years playing and writing music on his own. In 2019, he teamed back up with his brother and best friend S. Wesson on Western Mirrors, a collaborative music project with a revolving cast of friends—including the ever-present Moore—and the creation of their Wesson House music studio in Houston.

Hungate veered away from the music industry, turning his creative talents toward art school and building a successful career as a designer and digital creative director."

People never knew what they might see with these guys. Their costumes varied from Harlem Globetrotter outfits, clear plastic bags with lights on the inside, Elvis-impersonator-suits, faces-on-their-shirts, space fairies or otherwise. Generally speaking, Smarty Pants always tried to keep the viewer interested visually as well as musically.

Smarty Pants’ list of recordings is a long one and they were always quick to release something new that the fans wouldn’t be expecting. If anything, Smarty Pants tried to keep their loyal fans happy, and provide affordable recordings. Obviously, not so much as to rake in the bucks, but as to reward them for their interest and get their music out to anyone who would listen.

The spark of interest came from a few far and away places. Smarty Pants got to be on a compilation by famed Abuse Records in the UK. Their first full length CD, e=mc hammer, was released on North Carolina based cult label: Opulence Records. Smarty Pants made friends, often provided shows and places to stay for various touring bands passing through Oklahoma. Another CD compilation inclusion was put out by Dos Sensenseous zine from Texas. Much needed help and attempted spiritual guidance was provided for many years by LA based cykik.com Management.

But it was their die-hard local-Okie following that put the biggest twinkle in Smarty Pants’ eye. Few local bands can say they have fans who know most of the words to their songs. Or get several praised write-ups in the local newspapers and magazines. Or would have the support of the generous local/national label, Little Mafia Records, who released the band’s final full length CD, Annoyager. Or the friendship (perhaps respect) of many local bands and the few “good” all-ages clubs. Or writing the theme song to the midnight movie show, Has Been Heroes."

Active in the 1990s and 2000s, Breech embodied the musical vision of Missy Gibson and Mike Flanagan. Gibson came to Los Angeles from Detroit where her performances gained citywide attention, receiving praise from such press outlets as the Detroit Metro Times, who dubbed her ""the best independent singer/songwriter in the country."" Primary Critic for The All Music Guide, and Rolling Stone contributor Thom Jurek writes, ""Breech's songs reveal the beauty in human flaws, the subtleties of passion, and the dynamics of anger. They are raw, gutsy, frail, tainted with the stain of life and to the bone."" Gibson has also maintained a publishing deal with EMI since 1998. Mike Flanagan, a native Angelino, has received many accolades for his multi-instrumentalist and songwriting abilities.  “Flanagan is a striking talent… an impressive songwriter… a commanding vocalist… (with) Elvis Costello’s tunefulness and full-bore passion…” says the Los Angeles Times.  

Breech has consistently delivered praiseworthy releases, including their self-titled debut (1999), cd single Junk (2000), the above-mentioned Apron Strings (2002) and Demos Dust and Debris (2003), a collection of live acoustic tracks and recordings seldom heard.  Their last release was Tarnish and Undress (2007).
 
Breech’s music has been featured in film and television, on shows such as the WB’s ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Black Sash.”  They have also appeared on Canadian TV's ""Much Music,"" and PAX TV’s “Ed McMahon’s Next Big Star.” Breech have toured the country extensively on their own, as well as opening for many national acts, including Weezer, the late Jeff Buckley, White Stripes and Liz Phair.

The Muffs started as a collaboration between guitarists Kim Shattuck and Melanie Vammen, both former members of the 1980s all-female hard rock group, [a=The Pandoras]. The band started performing and recording after the addition of bassist Ronnie Barnett (Shattuck's then-boyfriend) and drummer Criss Crass.  Following the release of their first album in 1993, Crass left the band.  By the time the band recorded their second LP, 1995's ""Blonder and Blonder"", Melanie Vammen had departed and Roy McDonald was the group's drummer.  This would become The Muffs' definitive line-up.  That same year, the band released one of their best-known songs, a cover of [a=Kim Wilde]'s ""Kids In America"", for the soundtrack to the movie ""Clueless"" (ironically, it was a song that the band reportedly neither liked nor ever performed live).  After 2004's ""Really, Really Happy"" LP the band went on extended hiatus, not returning to action until 2012 (Kim Shattuck credited former drummer Jim Lespesa, who filled in on tour after Chris Crass left, with bringing her, Ronnie Barnett, and Roy McDonald back together).  The band recorded a new album, ""Whoop Dee Doo"" that year but its release was delayed when Shattuck was offered the bass-playing slot in the [a=Pixies].  Her Pixies stint was famously short-lived and the album was released in 2014.  The band's final album, ""No Holiday"" was released in October 2019, shortly after Shattuck's death from complications related to ALS."

They perform under the name ""Melvins Lite"" with Trevor Dunn on stand-up bass and under the name ""Melvins 1983"" with Dale on bass instead of drums, in reference to the early incarnation of the band circa 1983 before Dale played the drums in the band. The name Melvins came from a grocery clerk at the Thriftway in Montesano where King Buzzo served as clerk and vandal. Melvin was the most hated fellow employee and they felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.

The two split of and joined up with other local players in a band called Symposium. they then found Fat Nellie on the drums.  That band had a two year stint on the local scene and gained a modest local following.  But soon after Chad and Enoch found themselves going yet another direction and formed the band Greedy Edna.  For the first six months of the bands existence they went through many line-up changes,  going through almost all of the local drum and bass players.  Finally and ironically the two decided to call upon Fat Nellie (Symposium's old drummer).  It was a perfect fit.  And also around the same Enoch had met his old friend from high school (Dan Hescock) in a parking lot and remembered he had been an accomplished bass player.  Dan soon after tried out for the band and once again clicked.......   Greedy Edna was formed.......  The band immediately started working on songs Chad and Enoch had been writing in the meantime and came out with its first demo in '96.  It's six songs grabbed the attention of all the local kids and people started coming out in droves to see this new band.  The new metal wave had not yet sunk its teeth into the area yet and this was a new sound for everyone.  Greedy Edna began to spread from its local area and use New England itself to call home.  After four years on the scene Greedy Edna has made a presence in area music.

Pathetic Element began as a cover band, Level, playing songs by Deftones, Coal Chamber, and Stabbing Westward. Nearly one year after forming, the band began writing their own music and playing fewer covers. Once the band started writing songs of their own, Roy decided to focus more on singing, and left the guitar playing to Jaime. After changing their name to Distraught, the band played numerous shows around the South Texas Area. The band recorded a six-song demo in January 2000 and added three more tracks the following November. Three months later, the band decided to add a new bass player, Edward Garza, so that David’s brother could begin playing guitar. The band continued writing and performing as Pathetic Element.

Local and regional gigs followed as the band readied material for their debut release ""bright,"" recorded in the summer of '99. Word spread and Trustfall quickly built a rabid fan-base eager for the CD, culminating in a sold-out release show at O'Brien's in Boston (Oct 23,1999). Trustfall's live reputation enabled them to secure gigs all over New England, as well as New York City, PA., and Upstate N.Y. ""Bright"" charted #31 on the CMJ Loud Rock Chart and #20 on FMQB after a successful radio campaign in April/May 2000. Trustfall was chosen as band of the month on theprp.com (Pimp Rock Palace) for May 2000. On Farmclub.com, Trustfall was listed as a featured artist twice.

In late summer of 2000, the band parted ways with the original vocalist and auditioned and accepted vocalist Ryan Potts and also added second guitarist Steve Cronin. The new line-up debuted less than a month later at the Continental in NYC. Regional gigs played since have proven that Trustfall's new sound has been accepted by the old fans and won over many new converts. The band is ready to spearhead music in the 21st century. Forthcoming releases and a rigorous performance schedule will cement their reputation as one of New England's premier loud rock experiences."

Over the next five years, their music (dark, goth-tinged rock and roll influenced by artists like The Cure, Black Sabbath, Siouxsie and the Banshees, X, Lords of the New Church, and The Clash) and their theatrical, high-energy live performances enjoyed considerable success on the local level, drawing large crowds to their shows at the Ross and Alhambra Theatres. During this period, STC released two self-financed cassette-only albums, 1985's ""Blue Creatures"" and 1988's ""Secret Desire"". In 1989, the band set off to Nashville, Tennessee in search of a larger audience , where they played shows with bands like Mr. Crowe's Garden (The Black Crowes), Rock City Angels, Chagall Guevara, Anastasia Screamed, and The Grinning Plowman. In 1991, personal conflicts and professional frustrations took their toll, resulting in the band's demise.

Fast forward six years to Cincinnati, Ohio, where, as fate would have it, the four core band members had all moved, albeit at different times and for different reasons. A phone call between Mark and Kevin resulted in the idea of a one-off reunion gig. The show, performed in August 1997 at the Sho-Bar in Evansville, was a rousing success, reuniting the band with a couple of hundred old friends and convincing the band to stay together and give STC another shot. The show also provided the capital to begin the recording of a new, eponymously-titled album featuring re-recordings of classic STC material that the band felt had never been properly recorded or released. ""Stop the Car"" was released on CD in 1998. Halloween 1999 saw the release of a brand-new CD of all-new songs, ""Crash"", as well as limited-edition CD re-releases of earlier albums and previously unreleased material.

Stop the Car disbanded once again in early 2000, although the band has reunited on four different occasions (2005, 2006, 2007, and 2019) to play shows in their old Evansville stomping grounds, and in 2012, the band recorded two songs (""Smile and Fake It"" and ""Screaming Dykes"") for Piñata Productions' short film, ""One Day Summer"".

Since 2008, Mark and Melissa have performed together in Magnolia Mountain, an acclaimed Roots/Americana band based in Cincinnati with four albums to their credit. After performing for a time with the successful Renaissance-era music band Teribus, Kevin has devoted his time chiefly to songwriting, recording, and online collaborations with musicians from all over the world. Vincent continues to play, write, and record music, most recently with Cincinnati hard rock band LOVECRUSH88.

Miles Dethmuffen recorded three well-received albums -- Nine-Volt Grape (1990), Clutter (1994), and Miles Dethmuffen (1995) (as well as 1992's outstanding Mouth of Hell 7"") -- before changing their name to the less-goofy (and more forgettable) Permafrost in 1996.

Frank, Bean-Pardee, and drummer Adam Goodwin continued as a trio for a brief period, but broke up amicably before any new recordings were made. Songs written by the trio but never recorded by them appear on Frank's first two solo albums. 
Ad Frank's self-titled solo debut came out on the Boston indie Jackass Records in 1999, featuring a new recording of Miles Dethmuffen's 1995 song ""Sleeping Bag"" and a solo acoustic version of Romeo Void's ""Flash Flood"" alongside a strong group of new originals.

Sucker has been hard at work, and their determination is starting to pay off. The guys are excited to release their new CD ""Get On Board"" and video for the first single Shut Up. The new CD was recorded at 54 Sound in Detroit by Steve King (Eminem, George Clinton). Sucker has been gaining more and recognition with the press and radio and has received international offers to have their music included in sports television, and even video games. 

The band is all about their live show, and their goal is to captivate each and every audience member with their raw energy. Sucker has been touring extensively throughout the west and midwest, and have played with bands like Primus, Fishbone, Spearhead, The Long Beach Dub-Allstars and Pennywise. 

""Get On Board"" is part funk, part hardcore and part reggae with a pinch of hip-hop flavor thrown in the pot. Sucker's music is different than most hardcore groups not only because of the blend of other styles, but mostly because of the positive message they are trying to get across. They want to let people know that music is a tool for decompressing yourself. Instead of being angry about everything, Sucker has a positive vibe and hopes it will motivate people to be real. 

The recent addition of Aaron Ficca, aka Jr Mint, on drums has taken Sucker's energy to a whole new level. With Sid Greenbud's monster grooves and slaps on bass, Rodney Coquia's colorful guitar licks, Scott Stoughton's diverse and animated vocals and now Aaron's hip-hop and hardcore inspired drum beats, Sucker has become a machine of electricity and energy. 

Make sure you get a taste of these guys, because this Sucker has a flavor that you're not likely to forget! "

Baltimore-based Love Riot was formed in 1994 by singer Lisa Matthews and guitarist Mikel Gehl, It was a popular original alt-rock band in the 90's. The group won a worldwide contest sponsored by Yamaha, traveling to Japan and winning grand prize in 1994. They took the prize money and recorded a cassette-only release called Muscle, produced by Eric Ambel. The group went on to sign with the indie label Squirrel Boy Records, and released two critically acclaimed recordings: Maybe She Will (1996) and a 4-song EP Killing Time (1997). The group left the label and released the CD Heaven Can Wait (1998).
Love Riot songs appeared in TV shows and soaps and a couple movies, and they appeared as themselves busking in ""The Subway"" episode of NBC's Homicide - Life On the Street. 
In 2000, Lisa Mathews had a baby and decided to put Love Riot on the shelf, wanting to create music for the little one taking all her attention Mikel Gehl and his wife had a son a year after, and the two founded Milkshake, a rock band for kids. Millkshake went on to release 5 award-winning albums for kids. 2010's Great Day received a Gramy nomination for ""Best Musical Recording For Children"". Now that Lisa and Mikel's kids are older, it seems fitting to re-start Love Riot and make music for adults again. We’ll see.

At their best, they have contributed to some of the most gratifying experimental music of the past five years, drawing comparisons to everything from the Residents to Zoviet France to early Pink Floyd, defying categories even as they are pigeonholed. Literally, the duo's records have been reviewed in extreme noise zines one week and played nationwide by new age DJs the next, at home in both places but ridiculously unfit for either. 
Mandible Chatter, as an ongoing musical experiment, has the uncanny ability to occasionally rip the casual listener away from passive listening, into a tumult of sweet melody and/or rhythm, devoid of lyrics, but rich with things to say. No one else comes close to this brand of subtle arrogance. The music of Mandible Chatter is an impossibility... like a man who casts no shadow, a joke to be told at funerals, clichés transformed into mystical archetypes, sacrosant ideas converted into preposterous cliché.

As a child, he played piano, guitar and flute. He went to college in St. Louis where he discovered free jazz, before dropping out and moving to Manhattan. There he gave concerts in his small apartment, playing a variety of reeds, duck calls, tapes, etc; almost anything. In the mid 1980s he signed to the [l146599] label. Since then, he has released a very large number of records, usually putting out several each year. Zorn's recorded output includes records by two bands of his own, Masada (a klezmer band playing music that is often described as Jewish jazz) and Naked City (an often aggressive mix of jazz, rock and grindcore). He has also worked with musicians like [a=Bill Frisell], [a=Derek Bailey], [a=Fred Frith], [a=Keiji Haino], and [a=Bill Laswell]. He has written music for television and film, which has been collected in the ongoing [l227476] series of records on his [l3650] label. Some of these are jazz-based, others are classical. He has also written several ""game pieces"", in which performers are allowed to improvise while following certain structural rules. These works are in the main named after sports, and include Pool, Archery and Lacrosse, as well as Cobra.

253282,105178,433659,US,Screeching Weasel,Emo,1999,0.0,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Punk'],"Punk rock band formed in 1986 in Prospect Hts, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

During this time, the band did not play songs recorded by American Steel. In 2007, Henderson, Massey, and Peck felt compelled to return to a sound closer to American Steel's brand of punk rock, parted ways with Kissinger and Stephen Loewinsohn (who had replaced Gowan on keys), reunited with original American Steel drummer Healy, and revived the American Steel name. The reunited American Steel, in turn, did not play songs from the Communiqué catalog. After recording 2009's Dear Friends & Gentle Hearts and touring for a few years afterward, bassist Peck moved overseas, and the band has been mostly inactive, however, they have not broken up, and occasionally play shows and record new material, such as 2019's State of Grace single."

The band was formed in South Jersey around the nucleus of Ryan Ogren on lead vocals and guitar and Matt Emburgia on lead and rhythm guitars. The two had been playing in various bands together since the 8th grade and adopted the name Don't Look Down when the in early '98 around the same time bassist Jesse Rendell joined the fold. The members had become regulars at local punk shows, having been exposed to the music years earlier through their involvement in the surf scene and shared the common goal of making this band their life, no matter how difficult a task this might represent. 

By late 2000 the band had toured around the entire country a couple of times and was ready to go back into the studio to record their new material. The result was a four song demo that while admittedly ""lo-fi"" showed enormous growth in their writing and their ability to self produce their own music. It was this demo that prompted New York based indie record label Iguana Records to sign the band. "

Ironically, on their last day of school in 1998, the band played their farewell show as the boys parted ways for different colleges."

918791,1840675,2733625,US,Dynamite Boy,Finder's Keeper's,1999,42.7,12,['Album'],['Rock'],['Punk'],"Dynamite Boy was a pop punk band from Austin, Texas. Their final and longest lasting line-up included Sean Neil, Dusty Kohn, Adrian Munoz and Sam Rich. They disbanded in 2005 after a ten-year career, with several reunions between then and 2014, where they celebrated the 10th anniversary of the release of their final record. They have been inactive since.

Dynamite Boy were formed in 1995 in Austin, Texas by Andrew Leeper, Matt Greco, Lester Chiu, and John Huckleba after shifting to a more pop punk style from their previous punk and funk incarnation known as Yoda's Love Child. Original singer Lester Chiu left a few months in and was replaced by Sean Neil, then of the Contradicks. Sean originally joined just as a singer but started playing guitar after facing crippling stage fright during his first show with the band. They recorded a demo tape in 1996, along with a split 7"" with The Impossibles made to coincide with an ill-fated tour to the West Coast in the summer of 1996. Not long after the tour, drummer John Huckleba left and was replaced by Scott Williams, formerly of 4th Grade Nothing and Spill. This line-up recorded their first full-length album, Hell is Other People in December of 1996 and January of 1997. Before that record was released through Offtime Records late in 1997, bassist Matt Greco left. He was briefly replaced by Craig Tweedy of the Impossibles, before the band found a permanent replacement with Adrian Munoz in 1998.

The band played shows primarily in Texas for their first few years, before signing to Fearless Records in 1999, recording and releasing their second full-length album, Finder's Keepers and a contractually obligated EP for Offtime Records called Devoted, which went unreleased until 2001. The final original member, Andrew Leeper, announced his intention to leave during the recording of Finder's Keepers as he did not want to tour. He was replaced by Daniel Cavazos, who played with the band through the recording of their third album Somewhere in America, released in 2001. That year drummer Scott Williams left and was replaced by Sam Rich. Guitarist Daniel Cavazos was ultimately replaced by Dusty Kohn, while Urny Maxwell of Cruiserweight filled in when possible in between. Maxwell appears playing guitar with the band in the Satellite music video.

During their existence, Dynamite Boy toured with bands such as The Ataris, The Offspring, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Further Seems Forever, Riddlin' Kids, Cruiserweight, Fall Out Boy, Mest, and Lost City Angels.

After releasing their last album in 2004, Dynamite Boy disbanded in 2005, after Sean Neil expressed his desire to quit touring and start a family.

Also in 2004, the band wrote and recorded the title track (same name as the film) for the short film Gay By Dawn, under the moniker of the band name 'Loincloth'.

On April 21, 2008, Punkbands.com reported that Dynamite Boy had reformed and would be playing at the Emo's in Austin on April 26, although this was not the band's first reunion show; they had previously got together for one-off shows in both 2006 and 2007 in Austin. The 2008 show was in celebration of a release of a digital only rarities collection called Time Flies. Dynamite Boy played further reunion shows in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.

In 2002 Dynamite Boy did a cover of ""I Want It That Way"" made famous by the Backstreet Boys for the album Punk Goes Pop created by Fearless Records, they also did a cover for another album for the Punk Goes... series: ""T.N.T"" by AC/DC for the Punk Goes Metal album. Also in 2003 the band lent its music to be used to in the Disney film ""MXP: Most Extreme Primate."" The songs ""AV99"", ""Kaleidoscope"", and ""Little Bobby"" are featured in the film with ""AV99"" mimed by Trevor Wright's character Jay's band as a celebration for his little brother and a chimp winning a snowboard race."

The 1999 album was recorded in a reported drug-fueled two-day frenzy, when all three of the band’s members were under age 21. Produced by late Hickey frontman and San Francisco Mission legend Matty Luv, Rock Immortal was released on the now-defunct DIY co-op label Smarmy Post-Angst Musicians (SPAM) Records.

Mission artist Chubby did the cover art, an apocalyptic cartoon scene of burning buildings; a sun with a line-snorting straw in its nose; a spread-eagle pigtailed girl licking a lollipop and pinching the thigh of a character twice her size; and a tattooed tranny eating a bowl of cereal, with a quote bubble that reads, “Told you dat shit will kill you.”

Darius Koski joined on guitar & vocals in 1990; McKenna then departed, Joel Dison joined and the group began writing originals, releasing the ""Gives You Strength"" 7"" and ""Scared"" 10"". Dison left in '92 and was replaced by Max Huber. 

A number of singles, EPs and the group's first LP, ""The Streets of San Francisco"" (all of which saw Koski becoming the band's dominant songwriter) followed, prompting the group to sign to longtime label Fat Wreck Chords. 

Wickersham left before the recording of 1998's ""Five Lessons Learned"" and Spike Slawson was later announced as the group's new bass player. Huber departed during the 2002 recording of ""Dead Flowers, Bottles, Bluegrass and Bones,"" and, following a string of touring guitarists, was replaced on a permanent basis by ex-One Man Army and Dead To Me member Jack Dalrymple. In 2012, Spike Slawson left the group, to be replaced by Miles Peck of The Sore Thumbs.

Band members are active in a number of side projects, including Filthy Thieving Bastards, The Druglords Of The Avenues, toyGuitar, One Man Army, and The Sore Thumbs.

The band played their first show on Mother's Day in 1993 and after a few lineup changes, were composed of Rubio Cisneros on drums, Mitch on bass, Tony Avitia on guitar, and Butch Klotz on vocals. Shortly after releasing their first demo, Mitch left the Houston area to get married. He was replaced by Jeff, before Rubio took over the bass role. Damon DeLaPaz filled in the drum position, and this lineup recording the self titled 1994 demo, along with the group's first EP, Elementary School Love, that same year. Ativia then left the group to start I-45 and after a few temporary guitarists, Chris LaForge of I-End Result picked up as their official guitarist. This lineup remained stable during their most active period in the mid to late 90s. Touring Houston, Dallas, and Austin, 30 Foot Fall's popularity grew; they would later become openers for larger bands such as Screeching Weasel and Sum-41 among others.

In 1995, on Fuzzgun Records, they released their first studio album Divided We Stand. In 1996 they also released their second EP, Junior High Sucked. After hearing a demo, Bob Becker of Fearless Records signed 30 Foot Fall to a record deal and in 1997 produced their next album Acme-143.

The band toured extensively alongside other notable bands such as Bigwig and Diesel Boy. They self released the EP Cartoons in 1998. Two of the three songs from Cartoons were included on their next album. At this time, DeLaPaz received a record deal offer with MCA Records for his other band Fenix*TX and moved to California. Brian Davis of Middlefinger was brought in to replace him.

In 1999, the band released their most successful album, Ever Revolving, Never Evolving, on Nitro Records. The release was followed by numerous shows including a tour with The Vandals.[2] Despite being at the height of their popularity, 30footFALL went on hiatus after the conclusion of their 1999 tour, citing the need to spend more time with family. Chris LaForge left the band at this time to seek other musical ventures. Jason Davis, brother of drummer Brian Davis) and formerly of Middlefinger, was brought on to play guitar when they resumed playing locally in spring of 2000. This line-up recorded The Doppler Effect in 2002. At this time, 30footFALL chose not to tour for the new album. Instead, the band chose to play occasional Houston/Dallas/Austin shows and their annual 30footFALL Christmas show at Fitzgerald's in Houston, TX. In 2003, with Chris LaForge back in the band, they released 10yearsandstillFALLING, a live album which documents their ten years as a band.

At their 2005 Christmas Show, Klotz announced that he would be moving to Virginia, ending his 12 years in the Houston punk scene.

On December 25, 2010, at their 16th annual Christmas Show, the band self-released their Jesus, Elvis, and Richard Petty EP, which was their first studio release since 2002's The Doppler Effect. In 2012, 30footFALL were featured in When We Ruled H-Town, which documents Houston punk bands and their rise to popularity in the 1990s.

Chris LaForge passed away on May 29th, 2017. He was replaced by Skeleton Dick guitarist Chris Vasquez. In October, 30footFALL released Champion Song, the final recording to feature LaForge on guitar.

Jason Davis left the band in 2023, returning 30footFALL to a four piece. The group released their first EP in 13 years, National Treasure...And Other LaForgeries in March 2024."

The three musicians had been playing together in bands for a while, and in June of that year they combined their talents with vocalist and guitarist Jeremy Hernandez to form Highstrung, characterized by an aggressive guitar-driven sound. Just months after they started playing together, Highstrung went into the studio to lay down tracks for their first demo, “Something has Changed.” The cassette sampled five songs.
They began to get booked almost every week for gigs, sharing the stage with many artists, including Bigwig, Shades Apart, Digger, and The Alkaline Trio. 
They landed back in the studio in 1998 to record their first full-length album. However, at the time, another opportunity presented itself to Jeremy, and in 1998 he left Highstrung to pursue other interests. As a result, the untitled album was never released.
Pat, Sam, and John wrote new songs and took their style from pop punk to a more progressive, hard rock sound. In 1999, with all new material and new guitarist Jeremy Comitas, Highstrung recorded and released their EP “This Time Around.” In 2000, Jeremy Comitas left Highstrung, and Pat, Sam, and John went into the studio one last time to record three new songs.
In 2001 Highstrung officially broke up."

They have existed off and on since 1990.  [a=Ben Weasel] was the band's original rhythm guitarist.

Between 1991 and 1994, the Vindictives were extremely active in the studio, recording material that would appear on nine 7"" EPs, a 5"" single of Sex Pistols covers, a double 10"" of cover songs, an entire cover of the Ramones' ""Leave Home"" LP, and various compilation tracks, all released between 1991 and 1995.  The first 6 EPs, which were released on the band's own [l=V. M. L. Records], were remixed (with guitar and backing vocal contributions from Ben Weasel replaced by Billy Blastoff, who became the band's permanent guitarist in late 1992), and, along with several compilation tracks, were compiled on the ""The Many Moods Of The Vindictives"" compilation on Lookout! Records.  The band began working on their first full-length collection of original material (entitled ""Rat-A-Tat"") in 1993, but this was interrupted when Joey got into a car accident and further complicated by Dr. Bob's substance abuse problems.  The band's classic line up of Joey Vindictive (vocals), Johnny Personality (bass), Billy Blastoff (guitar), Dr. Bob (guitar), and PJ Parti (drums) dissolved in the summer of 1994.  Joey, Johnny, and Billy rehearsed with guitarist Mike Byrne and drummer Tres Quatro in 1995 & 1996 but this line up managed only 1 show together.  In July of 1996, Joey announced that the band was ceasing due to his ongoing medical and emotional issues.

In 1997, the band released a split 7"" with the Sloppy Seconds, featuring an old tune that Ben Weasel had written and recorded with the band.  In 1998, Joey, Johnny, and Billy resurrected the Vindictives with drummer Angel Ledezma and recorded the ""Hypno-Punko"" LP.  A novelty Christmas 7"" appeared in 2000.  In late 2003/early 2004, the band issued 4 CDs, ""Oddities, Curosities, and the Bare Essentials"" (a collection of singles & comp tracks from 1994 to 2000), ""Original Masters"" (a collection of the band's original recordings with Ben Weasel), ""Muzak For Robots"" (featuring kraut-rock versions of old songs) and ""Unplugged"" (acoustic versions of old songs), on their own [l=Teat Productions] imprint.  In 2008, the band announced plans to reissue their discography and record new material, featuring a line up of Joey, Johnny, and PJ Parti, but these plans did not come to pass.

In 2019, after more than two decades performing live, both nearby, and in some of the further reaches the planet, Pulley was honored to be inducted into the Ventura County Music Hall of Fame. 2020 promises to be a busy year for Pulley, as they head into their 25th anniversary with plans to play shows in North America and Europe, as well as to begin writing the follow-up to their latest full length, “No Change in the Weather.”

Defiant by nature and direct to the point is unmistakably the motto for this five-piece Inland Empire punk outfit. Backside has worked hard and played even harder to earn themselves the reputation for putting on an extremely energetic live show that truly brings to life the genuine ideas, thoughts and messages contained within each song written, recorded and performed.

From punk fans to a punk band was obviously the most natural transition made by these clever kids with their hearts and minds all focused upon one common goal: to make music for change. With musical influences ranging from early punk pioneers such as Minor Threat and Bad Religion to current punk icons Rancid and NOFX it's obvious what has fueled the fire of Backside to continue what they are doing while remaining true to themselves and all in their surroundings. The DIY punk ethic holds very strong in the band and is well recognized by other bands, promoters and surrounding media.

Punk band from Boston, MA, formed in 1996 by Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar) and Mike McColgan (vocals).  The band is known for its Oi!/punk sound, its frequent covers of Irish standards, and lyrics which often focus on unions and working class ethics and concerns.  In 1998, the band signed to [l=Hellcat Records], a label run by members of [a=Rancid] and connected to [l=Epitaph Records].  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.  The split was amicable and McColgan would return to music a few years later, fronting the [a=Street Dogs].  He was replaced by Al Barr.  Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old [a=Woody Guthrie] poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".  It remains perhaps their best-known song.

In 2007, the Dropkick Murphys formed their own record label, Born & Bred Records, to release their material.

The group started off as hardcore punk act and their 1983 self-titled debut scored an unexpected hit with the song ""Institutionalized"", which went into heavy rotation on the poplar SoCal radio station KROQ. It was a full two years later in 1985 when a video was produced and got heavy airplay on MTV. Meanwhile, in 1984 the group was banned from performing live in the city of Los Angeles, citing concerns about crowd violence. The ban remained in effect until the early 1990s. By the end of the 1980s, the band had evolved into a full-fledged thrash metal band and would soon begin adding more funk influences into their music. In 1995, the group announced their split, marking the end to their most commercially successful period. Mike Muir and Mike Clark would resurrect the band in 1996 with new members and the group continues to this day, although their recorded output has been sparse since reuniting. 

Throughout Suicidal's career, Muir has fronted a number of side-projects like [a=Los Cycos], [a=No Mercy (3)], [a=Infectious Grooves], and his own solo act, [a=Cyco Miko]. These acts have usually featured other members of Suicidal, as well."

The band is known for its Oi!/punk sound, its frequent covers of Irish standards, and lyrics which often focus on unions and working class ethics and concerns.  In 1998, the band signed to [l=Hellcat Records], a label run by members of [a=Rancid] and connected to [l=Epitaph Records].  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.  The split was amicable and McColgan would return to music a few years later, fronting the [a=Street Dogs].  He was replaced by Al Barr.  Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old [a=Woody Guthrie] poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".  It remains perhaps their best-known song.

In 2007, the Dropkick Murphys formed their own record label, Born & Bred Records, to release their material.

Current lineup:
Al Barr - lead vocals
Ken Casey - lead vocals, bass
Matt Kelly - drums, bodhran, vocals
James Lynch - guitar, vocals
Tim Brennan - guitar, accordion, vocals
Jeff DaRosa - mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, whistle, acoustic guitar, keyboard, vocals

DDT come from Vancouver/Canada and has taken a different route with their mixture of hard-core, funk, rap and ska than most other crossover bands. Their music isn't just hard-core with a few scratches it is more a fusion of the sounds at their roots. The drums run through a constant changeover between hard-core beats with lots of punch and the more delicate ska sound.

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

The band's first release was 1989's ""Whack & Blite"" 7"" on their own Blackball Records.  The band released 3 LPs and made appearances on different compilations for various independent labels before signing to a major label, DGC, at the end of 1994.  However, their major label debut, ""Dear You"", failed to expand their audience and brought cries of ""sell out"" their punk rock fan base.  This, coupled with already-present interpersonal tensions within the band that had reached the breaking point caused the band to split in 1996.  Following the split, the members performed with other acts, most notably Blake's Jets To Brazil.  Blake and Chris also returned to college to pursue various degrees while Adam resurrected Blackball Records to reissue much of Jawbreaker's out of print music as well as putting out records by other bands he has been involved with.

Their song and album titles revolve around egg puns (i.e. ""Bat Out of Shell"") They have had approximately 70 releases from over 30 different record labels.
The McRackins nearly always play live in full costume and made up to look like two eggs and a dog. The band claims that they were transformed from men to two eggs and a dog and given super pop-punk powers as the result of a freak nuclear accident. The band consists of twin eggs Bil (guitar, vocals), Fil (bass) and dog Spot (drums). Their original drummer Tommy (The Chicken) Thacker played on a few of the earlier releases and is now a member of famous Canadian band Gob and is also the touring guitarist for Sum 41. Theo Goutinakis from Gob also played bass on the bands 1999 release ""Comic Books And Bubblegum"".
With sporadic touring throughout their native Canada and the US up until that point, 1996 saw the band take their live show to Europe. Dubbed the European Eggvasion, the McRackins toured seven countries as well as recording some live electric and acoustic sessions for the BBC. The band has made several music videos, which have received light to medium rotation on music channels in Canada, the US, and Europe. Further media exposure includes an appearance in a Molson Canadian beer television commercial, a cameo role in an independently produced motion picture titled Downhill Willy, and various television and radio features.
The band came out of hiatus to finish their album Bat Out of Shell. Their twelfth full-length album was released worldwide in 2006 by Wynona Records, Italy and contained twelve new tracks. A full European tour followed in Jan/Feb 2007 in support, visiting over 30 cities in 12 countries over a 6 week span.
In early 2007, they released MCRACKINS VS JOKERS with Italy's JOKERS on San Martin Records, Italy. The band is currently completing their latest CD ""Eggzit"" which will be released in North America and Europe by New York based label ""Cheapskate Records"" in summer of 2008. The CD will also be released in Japan (with 5 bonus tracks) by new label ""Suggoi Records"" in December 2008 with their first ever tour of Japan in the spring of 2009.
In November 2009 Finland based punk label ""Killer Records"" released a new MCRACKINS live cd ""Live From Thunderbird Radio Hell"" which features a 1995 CITR radio session hosted by Nardwuar The Human Serviette. The band has also finished recording their 14th studio album ""It Ain't Over Easy"" which will be released in early 2010 and will support it with a 3-week European tour in April

Original line-up was: Poffen - vocals / Lanchy - guitar / Andreas - bass. Drummer Spennart joined the band a bit later but quit during the summer of 1986. He was replaced by Jörgen who was a guitarist originally. In 1987 Jörgen introduced Jesper, a friend whom with he had a two-piece band (TGU). He took over the drums and Jörgen started playing the second guitar. After releasing a string of 7''s the band went on hiatus in 1990. They also did a fanzine at that time called Antisystem. 

In 1994 Finn Records proposed a reforming of the band and released their first LP ""Sin Egen Motståndare"". Line-up this time was Poffen, Lanchy, Andreas and Jallo on drums. From '94 to 2000 the band continued to record but rarely played live. After releasing another LP, two split LP's (with Dismachine and Disclose) and a few singles they decided to disband again at the end of 2000.

After 6 years without recording sessions, they returned to the studio one last time and Prank released their third LP ""Vi Är Eliten""."

1287852,0,4595580,US,Random Conflict,New World Order,1999,32.83,17,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Hardcore', 'Oi']","Random Conflict is an American hardcore punk rock band formed in Huntsville, Alabama during July 1988. Originally a crossover band, their early recordings combined elements of both hardcore punk and metal. The band was formed by guitarist and vocalist Bill Reeves, formerly of the bands Suburban Nightmare and Miscarriage, and Jerry “DJ” Lawrence, previously of death metal group Skeletal Earth. They recruited bassist Charles Paul Jordan following the breakup of his punk band, Coup d’ Etat. After Random Conflict’s first show, Charles Paul was replaced on bass by Dave Nichols.

In late 1988, the trio released their debut seven-song cassette, Defying the Megadread, a crude, yet powerful 2-track, reel-to-reel recording of signature songs like “Cyanide Nazi Race” and “Grave Desires.” Early copies of this EP included a cover of the song “Halloween” as an uncredited bonus track.  

Random Conflict went through significant lineup changes over the next several months. They added Steve Shoemaker as a second guitar player, Larry Horgan replaced Dave on bass and Jay Stephens replaced Jerry on drums. By the summer of 1990, the four-piece released the Psychotronic Mecca cassette, six songs of doomy, fuzzed out trash metal including the popular “Atrocity Manifesto.” The group made two failed attempts at a follow up in 1990 (The Gay Street Demos and The Sock Tape), but only the song “The Process of Chronological Disruption” was released as part of the Angry Kids Unite! 1991 compilation cassette on Peer Pressure Productions. Larry left the band in 1990 and was replaced on bass by Rob Moore, and in the spring of 1991, drummer Ray York was added to the band as Jay and Steve left to form the band Scoff.

In August 1991, the new Random Conflict lineup released Shadows of Existence, a three song 7” record on Peer Pressure Productions. A year later those songs would appear as bonus tracks on the CD version of Internal Visions, a straight-ahead metal album also on Peer Pressure Productions. Internal Visions featured remakes of a few older songs as well as new material like the feminist “Object,” the haunting instrumental “Seconds Underwater” and the Kiss inspired “Brainwashed.”  

Creative and personal tensions between Rob and Ray following the Internal Visions tour culminated in a fistfight between the two leaving Ray hospitalized. Bill and Rob tried unsuccessfully to find a new drummer over the next several months, but eventually they agreed to abandon Random Conflict in the summer of 1993.

In the spring of 1996 Bill met Brian Murphree, who had been playing bass with Jerry in the band Mozaik. Jerry suggested that he and Bill reform Random Conflict for a few shows with Brian filling in on bass. The reunion of the band was so popular that the trio quickly focused on writing new songs, and by August they released the Blown Fuse cassette, quickly followed by a split 7” record with the Birmingham, Alabama band, Anti-Crisis, on Pun Crock Records. The cassette When We Do Right No One Remembers, When We Do Wrong No One Forgets followed two years later.

In September 1999, Random Conflict released their second CD, New World Order, a street punk/Oi! influenced album that included fan favorites like “10%,” the nostalgic “1987” and the foreboding, “New World Order.” They began work on the follow up album Annihilation Generation in 2002. However, Jerry’s waning interest in music, Bill’s commitments to other bands Deathcamp Experiment and Riot City Carnival and Brian’s involvement in Daikaju delayed the official release of Annihilation Generation until 2007. Early copies of the album were released as a split CD with the Knoxville, Tennessee based band U.S. Police State, while additional pressings did not include U.S. Police State.

With the approaching 20th anniversary of the band, Bill, Brian and Jerry began revisiting Random Conflict songs from the late 80s and early 90s like “Bloodlust,” “Alone” and “Mr. Slaughter.” In late 2008, they released the Invisible City CD on Stick Man Records, a new recording of ten early era songs and a few contemporary compositions like “Scum,” “No Communication,” “Madness” and “Insanity.”

By late 2010, Jerry left the band for good, and he was replaced on drums by Adam Jackson. Following the breakup of Adam and Bill’s other band, Blood Red Baby Blue, Adam soon lost enthusiasm for Random Conflict and by May 2012, Fist of the North Star’s former drummer Edwin Coombs joined the group.

In January 2013, the new lineup released a four-song split 7” record with Edwin’s other band, The Commonwealth of American Natives on Shit Starter Records. August 2013 marks the 25th anniversary of Random Conflict and the release of their new twelve song LP/CD, Tradition is the Enemy, on No Profit Records. 

Tradition is the Enemy is musically raw, aggressive and rebellious, yet easily accessible and masterfully produced. The songs are heavily influenced by 80s American hardcore (Black Flag and Minor Threat), early 80s U.K. punk and metal (Motörhead and Discharge) and contemporary punk (Propagandi and Leftöver Crack), but presented in a way that is fresh and uncontrived. The lyrics tear down the façade of modern culture, exposing evil and corruption, while offering hope and calling for unity. This isn’t a record you’ll hear on the radio or in a car commercial on TV. This is punk rock as it is meant to be…iconoclastic. Many critics have written punk rock’s obituary, and who can blame them? Most contemporary acts tend to be more interested in corporate sponsorships than writing and recording music that will stand the test of time. But the flame still burns in North Alabama with the punk rock stalwarts, Random Conflict!

College aspirations seemed to put the band to an early end, and outside of a few house parties, the original group never played live.  Over the years, due to its crude sound and outrageous lyrics, ""Gacy's Place"" developed a cult following, finding such famous fans as [a=Steve Albini] and [a=Jello Biafra].  In 1982, the band, sporting a different line-up, put out a second 7"" called ""Sex Cells"", which did not have the same impact as ""Gacy's Place"".

MU330's lineup has changed frequently, but the foundations of the band remained intact — Potthast, Diebold, Bell, and Moll.

The band is self-described as ""psycho ska"" and are known for their lively performances and a general ethic of fun and optimism. At the shows spectators encouraged to do the power skank, where fans hold their arms straight out in front of them and jog in place. They have been known to break out chainsaws and other wacky devices during their shows, proclaiming themselves the ""Kings of Rock and Roll"".

Their lyrics cover many topics, from racism to love songs to testicular cancer. Their lyrics, as well as the band, has matured since their inception in 1994. In their debut album they had songs like Danska, Stuff, and Fleeba (about a smelly girlfriend, being horny, and being fat, respectively) to newer more mature themes. They also changed their sound from a farther out, more experimental ska songs to a more mainstream sound.

Singer Dan Potthast has also released solo work."

Bio: “During the Civil War prostitutes were known as ‘Hookers’ after an obliging Union General of the same name who supplied his men with the passion to keep fighting the good fight. The same spirit lives on in the modern day HOOKERS who have been schooling audiences in hardcore punk technique for so long sometimes even they forget how great they truly are. And like a whore gone to seed, the mighty HOOKERS just keep on getting more depraved, more insane and more brutal with their two chord assault. Who says the day of miracles is past?""

Typical of the time, Come On was comprised of a ragtag group of artists and scenesters – seasoned musician George Elliott (guitar), conceptual guru Ralf Mann (bass), illustrator Page Wood (drums), teenager Elena Glasberg (guitar) who would study for class between gigs, and Jamie Kaufman (vocals) who had never sung before (or since) fronting Come On. With a unified egalitarian look of white button down shirts and black pants and Kaufman’s arresting stage presence the band embodied what they called “Nervous Rock Music.” Stripped down and tense, Come On’s brand of minimalist rock teemed with agitation, sexual frustration, and a wry, dark humor.

Compiling the band’s two singles, unreleased tracks, and live material from the late 70’s, Come On is recommended for fans of early Talking Heads, DNA, Pere Ubu, and Half Japanese."

252732,8092,800154,Europe,Misfits,Famous Monsters,1999,53.62,22,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Heavy Metal', 'Horror Rock']","The Misfits are an American horror-themed punk rock band from Lodi, New Jersey. Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th. In 2016, Glenn Danzig and Doyle would reunite with Jerry Only and would perform two shows for the first time since 1983 at Riot Fest in Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois. The Event flyer read, ""They Said It Would Never Happen... The Original Misfits."""

Jordan and Brian endured numerous line up changes and and continued to progress musically until they were led to Kyle Vaden (saxophone), Tony Venniro (vocals and guitar), Lauren Coleman (vocals), and Christopher Piro (guitar). This is the line-up that turned the band into a musical endeavor that embraced experimentation and musical improvisation as much as it did catchiness and harmonization. It morphed into more than the sum of its parts, into something bluesy, rootsy, soulful, heavy, and light. To say it was a contradiction would be an understatement. Since 2006 members have been anything but idle in the interim. Brian Kolek and Kyle Vaden went on to form the band Huxtable for a brief time. Christopher Piro has been involved on and off with numerous local bands. Tony Venniro started the more rock influenced band Picture Pilot. Lauren Coleman relocated to the cooler shores of Orange County, CA, and formed her own project known as Pebaluna, who toured briefly with Rx Bandits through California, as well as a guest appearance on the 2008 The Sound of Animals Fighting release ‘The Ocean and the Sun’ (Epitaph Records). Jordan Rosenthal toured extensively across the country with local favorites One Pin Short, most notably opening for Streetlight Manifesto and Reel Big Fish, as well as writing numerous songs on their recent S/T release.

Subsequent SC5 releases have also earned the inspired praise of critics and fans alike. Through the years the cruddy-brilliant songwriting of James Butler and current songwriting team of Butler and co-conspirator Rick Storey have produced a unique body of work that has earned them a devoted fan base. They’ve been stars of 80s college radio, the BBC, and have influenced the best of indie rock’s melodic new breed.

The band achieved success in the mid-1980s and are best remembered for their hit single, ""Your Love"". The band's lineup at that time was guitarist John Spinks, vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis, and drummer Alan Jackman.

They enjoyed most commercial success in the US. Their first album, Play Deep, reached No. 9 on the Billboard 200 in 1985 and was certified triple platinum in the United States. The single ""Your Love"" reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 7 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The band continued to record and tour through the 1980s and then into the early 1990s. While subsequent albums Bangin' (1987) and Voices of Babylon (1989) saw some chart successes, the group's popularity waned.

Drummer Alan Jackman left and, as a duo, they recorded Diamond Days in 1991. After the disappointing response to their 1992 album Rockeye, which represented a shift towards progressive rock and arena rock, the group disbanded. They resumed touring in 1998, and released two live albums via their website, along with a new studio album, Any Time Now in 2004, which was later re-released in 2006. In 2011, the band released their final album, Replay, with original drummer Alan Jackman re-joining the band. Spinks died in 2014 after which the group officially disbanded."

""Bat Out of Hell"" has sold more than 43 million copies worldwide. After 35 years, it still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the best selling albums of all time.

Although he enjoyed success with ""Bat Out of Hell"" and ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell"" and earned a Grammy Award for 'Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance' for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native US. However, he retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for the number of weeks overall spent on the charts as of 2006. He ranked 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

He was one of the best-selling artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million copies. He has also appeared in over 50 movies and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His most notable roles included 'Eddie' in the American premiere of ""The Rocky Horror Show"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and Robert ""Bob"" Paulson in Fight Club.

Originally formed in 1997 as a 5-piece band featuring: [a=Tiffany Arbuckle] (vocals), [a=Joe Porter (2)] (drums), [a=Matt Stanfield] (keyboards), [a=J. J. Plasencio] (bass) and [a=Stephen Leiweke] (guitar).

All musicians left in 1999, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle (later [a=Tiffany Arbuckle Lee]).

Tiffany Lee (née Arbuckle) (born 1975, in Indianapolis, Indiana) is a Contemporary Christian music artist who uses the stage name Plumb. She frequently crosses over into numerous other genres of music, including Alternative rock, Christian alternative rock, Pop, Dance, and Electronica.

Tiffany is married to [a7183054] (founder of [a8702662]).

Plumb grew up in Fayetteville, Georgia, and started her career as a backup singer. Her album ""candycoatedwaterdrops"" won the 2000 Dove Award for ""Modern Rock Album of the Year"". Two tracks from it were hits for other artists; ""Stranded"" was a hit for [a74160], and ""Damaged"" was a big dance hit in 2003 in the United Kingdom for [a68767].

Plumb was marketed as a band during the first three album releases on Essential Records. The band was named after the Suzanne Vega song ""My Favorite Plum"".

Plumb wanted to leave the music industry after the 2000 album. Lee received a note from a girl a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about the Plumb song ""Damaged"" that Tiffany had written and recorded about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said ""'Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life."" The note inspired Tiffany to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records as a solo artist in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal. In order to leave Essential Records, Plumb had to fulfill her contract obligations, and this led to The Best of Plumb record in 2000 despite the fact she had only released two albums previously. The lead single from Plumb's 2003 Beautiful Lumps of Coal, called ""Real"", peaked at #41 in the UK Singles Chart.

Her album Chaotic Resolve entered the Billboard Top 200 album chart at #177 on , 2006. Better reached #1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow up, ""Cut"", hit #1 on XM's dance hits channel BPM, and #5 on Billboard's Dance Charts Hot Dance Airplay.

Plumb's music has been heard on major film soundtracks (Bruce Almighty, Just Married, View from the Top, Brokedown Palace, Drive Me Crazy, The Perfect Man, Mom at Sixteen, etc.) and TV series (Dawson's Creek, Felicity, ER, Roswell, One Tree Hill, etc.).

She has also written songs for artists such as Michelle Branch, Kimberley Locke, and Mandy Moore. [a263224] (no relation) of Evanescence mentioned that Plumb was one of her inspirations.

Her third solo album Blink was released on , 2007. ""In My Arms"", the first single off the album, was remixed by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones and hit the number one spot on the Billboard Dance Charts.

On May 19, 2009 she announced that she was recording a new album titled Beautiful History due out in the fall."

Joseph Williams was lead vocalist with [a=Toto] during the mid-to-late 1980s, and was featured on the albums ""Fahrenheit"" (1986) and ""The Seventh One"" (1988) before leaving due to personal problems. He can also be heard on the album ""Toto XX"" (1998) a compilation of rare and unreleased tracks, as well as co-writing and providing backing vocals on several more. He is featured on Toto's current CD, ""Falling In Between"".

He has released four solo albums: ""Joseph Williams"" (1982, re-released 2002), ""I Am Alive"" (1996), ""3"" (1997) and ""Early Years"" (1998, after being a fanclub only release a few years earlier). Many of Toto's members have contributed to his solo work over the years as he and the band have remained on good terms.

Joseph has also been a session vocalist and can be heard on numerous other projects including:

The song ""Save The Night"" on the soundtrack to the children's adventure film ""The Goonies"" (1985).
Lead vocals on three tracks - ""Walk The Wire"", ""History"" and ""When You Look In My Eyes"" from Jay Graydon's ""Airplay for the Planet"" album (1993).
On the songs ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" from Disney's animated feature film ""The Lion King"" (1994).
Sharing vocal duties on two albums by the a cappella covers group The West Coast All Stars; ""California Dreamin'"" and ""Naturally"" (1997/1998 respectively). The other vocalists are Bobby Kimball (another well-known Toto alumnus), Bill Champlin and Jason Scheff (from the band Chicago)(Tommy Funderburk replaced Champlin on the ""Naturally"" album). 
Providing lead vocals to the self titled first album by the band ""Vertigo"" in 2003.
He was also the writer of the original English lyrics for the song Lapti Nek and the Ewok Celeration from the original 1983 release of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, which was scored and conducted by his father John.

Ties to the band Chicago:

When Toto's Jeff Porcaro offered Jason Scheff the job of lead vocalist (replacing Fergie Fredricksen), Jason declined having already just gotten the job as new lead vocalist for Chicago (replacing Peter Cetera). Jason however recommended Joseph to Toto instead, after Chicago had just been listening to demos with Joseph singing lead vocals earlier that day, looking for material for the Chicago 18 album. Although none of his songs ended up on the album, a song written by Joseph, What You're Missing, appeared on the earlier ""16"" album.
Jason Scheff was also a close friend of Joseph's brother, Mark.
Joseph and Jason have also appeared on each other's recordings.
Joseph sings background vocals on Chicago's ""King of Might Have Been"" on the 2006 album ""XXX"" as well as on ""Let's Take a Lifetime"" on the 1993-recorded/2008-released album ""Chicago XXXII: Stone of Sisyphus"".
His brother, Mark Towner Williams, is a solo and session drummer who has played drums for Air Supply and a variety of other bands. The two brothers recorded a duo album in 1990/1991, but didn't succeed in landing a record deal for the album, which was subsequently cancelled. Mark has been working on remixing the album for a possible release since 1998, however the two brothers seemingly haven't found the time to rework it for an official release. Joseph recently commented that it was difficult to find the opportunity to do as Mark currently resides in Utah and Joseph in Los Angeles. Joseph and Mark are the sons of the internationally famous and multi- Academy Award winning composer/conductor John Williams, responsible for soundtracks to the Star Wars films and nearly all of Steven Spielberg's films including Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park and Schindler's List.

Since leaving Toto in 1989, Williams has kept busy as a composer of film and drama scores, most notably for episodes of the science fiction series ""Roswell"", and ""The Lyon's Den"" starring Rob Lowe.

In addition to his guest spot on the last Toto album ""Falling in Between"", a guest spot at several Toto concerts, the second Vertigo album ""Vertigo 2"" has been released in 2006. Williams also released an album of cover songs in 2006 featuring piano and voice only ""2 of us"" and returned with 2 other voice & piano albums in 2007 (Smiles and Tears). Currently he is recording a new album, to be released in 2008.

Rumour has it that both Joseph Williams and Fergie Frederiksen (singer on Toto's ""Isolation"") will join Toto on their 30th anniversary tour in 2008/9. However, on 5 June 2008 Toto guitarist Steve Lukather made an official announcement that Toto has ended as a band, which in essence means that no 30th anniversary tour will take place."

They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

The band was formed in 1975 by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Kelly Garni, vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth.   Despite their local popularity, the group was unable to secure a record deal in the United States.  Their first two albums, 1978's ""Quiet Riot"" and 1979's ""Quiet Riot II"" were released by CBS/Sony in Japan.  In 1979, Rhoads departed to accept an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne's solo band.  DuBrow and Forsyth continued on with new members before splitting in 1980.   After that, DuBrow continued with various players under the name ""DuBrow"".  Eventually, Dubrow included Kevin, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, drummer Frankie Banali, and bassist Rudy Sarzo (who initially joined Quiet Riot after the band recorded their 2nd album).  In 1982, DuBrow changed their name to Quiet Riot.   For many fans, this is the quintessential Quiet Riot line up.  In 1983, the band released ""Metal Health"" which would be the first heavy metal album to reach the top of the Billboard charts.  The band was unable to reproduce this success, however, and this, combined with their unhappiness with their recording contract and Kevin Dubrow's media assaults on his contemporaries led to the band fracturing, culminating in Dubrow being fired from the band he had co-founded.  The band recruited singer Paul Shortino as Dubrow's replacement before splitting in 1989.

In 1990, Dubrow and Cavazo relaunched Quiet Riot. By 1997, Banali and Sarzo would rejoin the band.  The band continued to release albums, although they never came close to their 1983 commercial heights.  In 2003, the band split again, but Dubrow and Banali reformed Quiet Riot the following year with bassist Chuck Wright, who had done stints in Dubrow and Quiet Riot throughout the 1980s, and guitarist Alex Grossi.  in 2007, Dubrow died from a cocaine overdose.  Banali issued a statement mourning his friend and stating that he would not continue Quiet Riot without Kevin.  However, in 2010, Frankie reversed his stance and reunited with Alex Grossi and Chuck Wright to revive Quiet Riot with previously unknown vocalist Mark Huff.  Huff was let go from the band at the beginning of 2012.  He was eventually replaced by another unknown, Scott Vokoun.  The band split with Vokoun in 2013.  He was replaced by Jizzy Pearl (formerly of Love/Hate and Ratt).  In 2014, a documentary called ""Well, Now You're Here, There's No Way Back"", was released.  The film, directed and produced by Banali's fiancee, focuses on Banali's attempts to restart the group, his anger over Dubrow's death, the group's tenure with Mark Huff, and their discovery of Scott Vokoun.  The band continued to cycle through vocalists.  Pearl departed in 2016 and the band was fronted by Seann Nichols and then former American Idol contestant James Durbin before Pearl returned again in 2019.  In August 2020, Frankie Banali died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  Per his last wishes, the band announced they would continue with drummer Johnny Kelly.  In 2021, former bassist Rudy Sarzo returned to the band."

Dogs On Valium was an original three-piece rock band from San Francisco with a knack for playing hooky power-pop music in the vein of Train, Crowded House, or the Wallflowers. 

In Eight years Dogs On Valium  has released three CDs: Spoiled Little Child, co produced by Night Ranger's Jeff Watson, Something For Everyone, mixed by Chris Issak's Mark Needham, and The Salt Mine Collection produced by Abshalom Jacob. Shelter from the Stars, a track from Something For Everyone, reached no. 1 on Garageband.com's pop-rock charts. An impressive feat considering that Jerry Harrison's (Talking heads) Garageband.com had over 95,000 songs on their site.  Dogs On Valium's songs have appeared on San Francisco's KFOG, KOME, KKLC, KZST, KRSH, KRQR, KPFA, and many European and, American college radio stations. DOV's music was also featured in national compilation CD's and in the feature-film ""Jerks"". In 1997 BAM magazine voted them One of the ten best unsigned bands in the Bay Area.  Due to radio rotation, many press articles, and a loyal  a fan base, DOV became a top club draw in California and its neighboring states. During exhaustive touring years in the USA, the band played shows with many notable acts including: Train, Night Ranger, Mr. Big, Counting Crows, Edgar Winter, The Tubes, Flock Of Seagulls, Box Set, Noel Redding, Leslie West, Tommy Castro, and Pete Best to name a few... 

In 1998 the band played an extensive European tour, performing in numerous countries to screaming festival crowds of 10,000 and more, and received rave reviews from the European press. The singles: When I Die, and Love Will Come had been in strong rotation on eastern European radio for over a month prior to the band's appearances, helping to increase independent CD sales. In 1999, a 30 minute documentary of the band was aired on TV stations across  the United States.

The most recent addition to the DOV  lineup was a former member of the nationally touring and Bammie award-winning nouveau swing band Lee Press-on and the Nails. With their polished radio-friendly sound, mature songwriting, boy-band good looks, and powerful dynamic stage-show, Dogs On Valium was  seemingly ready for anything.

The band  officially disbanded in 2003, but continued to release music from the its deep vaults until 2009. DOV also reunited for one night only shows  in 2005, and 2010. The band's founding member and Bass player Larry Santos Lim died at the age of 34 in 2004.

They became known for their lively group personae, instrumental virtuosity, fashion sense, and outspoken views. In particular, Natalie Maines' public criticism of President George W. Bush on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq led to considerable controversy for the group, causing them to lose a large part of their core country audience, but gain a new if somewhat smaller audience in the process.

For 51 years the band consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard and bassist and co-lead vocalist Dusty Hill, who was replaced (at his request) by the band's bass technician Elwood Francis after Hill's death on July 28, 2021. The band were formed by former [a684681] members Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell with bassist Lanier Greig, which form they recorded debut single [m329083]. Mitchell and Greig were then almost immediately replaced by former [a1057516] drummer Frank Beard and Billy Etheridge respectively, finalising their classic line-up when Dusty Hill, another former member of American Blues, replaced Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.

Since the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.

ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units. ZZ Top also ranks 80th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units."

He started out for a brief period of time as a glam rocker, but then tried out for a solo career with his first album [i]Chestnut Street Incident[/i] released by former [a=David Bowie] manager, [a=Tony DeFries] on the Mainman (division of MCA) label. 
That album was a complete flop partly due to the fact that the record label wanted to mold John into something he was not (a pretty boy ala James Dean) and the fact that the album consisted of only 6 originals and 5 cover songs. It was also the label's idea to release the album under the name [b]Johnny Cougar[/b] which Mellencamp did not approve of.
It wasn't until the release of [i]American Fool[/i], released this time under the moniker [b]John Cougar[/b], which featured his most well-known hit to date, ""Jack & Diane"" that he really made it big; the album stayed at #1 on the charts for nine weeks. 
Following that was [i]Uh-huh[/i] which would be his first release under the moniker [b]John Cougar Mellencamp[/b]; the name he would stick by until he gradually dropped the ""Cougar"" and just went by his given name [b]John Mellencamp[/b]. A heart attack in 1994 prevented him from touring for one of his most famous albums to date [i]Dance Naked[/i].

The band's first single, ""Fingers On It,"" received some recognition when it was featured in the 1986 cult movie Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.

By 1989, Enuff Z'Nuff had released their first major label offering, a self-titled debut album on Atco Records, with founding members Donnie Vie and Chip Z'Nuff being joined by guitarist Derek Frigo and drummer Vik ""Vikki"" Foxx. 

For their follow-up album, 1991's Strength, the band tried to tone-down their glam image. It was released in 1991 to strong reviews, however, this follow-up album did not sell nearly as well as their first.

The band filed bankruptcy and left Atco Records, but soon after  the band was picked up by Arista Records, releasing their 1993 album Animals With Human Intelligence. 

This release, much like Strength, received some critical acclaim, but ultimately failed commercially. Before the album's release, drummer Vikki Foxx quit the band to join Vince Neil's solo band. He was replaced by former ""War & Peace"" member Ricky Parent.

After Enuff Z'Nuff was dropped from Arista, guitarist Derek Frigo parted ways with the band. 

Lead singer and songwriter Donnie Vie stopped touring with the group in 2002 to embark upon a solo career. 
Enuff Z'Nuff continued to tour in his absence as a 3-Piece with their lead guitarist Johnny Monaco also serving as the band's singer. 

In 2004, former lead guitarist Derek Frigo died from an apparent drug overdose at the age of 37.

Another tragedy struck when the band's drummer Ricky Parent lost his long time battle with cancer in October 2007. Parent had been with the band for approximately 13 years.

The newly reformed Enuff Z'Nuff has performed at the Rocklahoma Music Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma in July 2008, on the same bill as Poison's Bret Michaels and Skid Row's Sebastian Bach. Since then, other tour dates have been announced.

A second release, 2001's Desperate, found Among Thorns striving for a harder, more straight-ahead rock sound while still retaining their focus on the spiritual aspects that had brought them together to begin with. Relocating to Nashville following Desperate, the band brought a new lead singer, Chad Jarnagin, into the fold as they prepared to record the follow-up. Working with noted Christian producer Paul Mills (Wayne Watson, Phillips, Craig & Dean, Lincoln Brewster), the group also was collaborating with artists such as Margaret Becker for Draw Near, which was scheduled for a September 2002 release.

While the particular musical style of the band is usually as malleable as Merritt's songwriting, its songs are commonly attributed to pop genres and subgenres: synthpop, indie pop, and noise pop. The band is often also cited as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous."

The Magnetic Fields is essentially a vehicle for Merritt's songwriting, along with various side-projects, such as The 6ths, Future Bible Heroes and The Gothic Archies. While the particular musical style of the band is usually as malleable as Merritt's songwriting, its songs are commonly attributed to pop genres and subgenres: synthpop, indie pop, and noise pop. The band is often also cited as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous."

Frankie Ford was featured as a stellar singer from New Orleans, on the Southern Stars poster created by Dianna Chenevert to promote him and historically document his contribution to the music industry. On October 12, 1983 USA Today reporter Miles White highlighted Ford as one of the famous entertainers on the poster, which helped give him more nationwide attention.

He was known as the ""New Orleans Dynamo"", and spent about 200 days a year on the road into his 70s. 

On May 16, 2010, at the Louisiana Music Homecoming in Erwinville, Ford was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame."

Punk Rock City USA was released by Slumberland Records in 1993, followed by Starduster (Homestead 1994), Communist Love Songs (Homestead 1996), and The Brighter Shore (Sealed Fate 1999). They toured the United States and Europe throughout the nineties, sharing the stage with such legendary bands as Polvo, Half Japanese, Yo La Tengo, The Grifters, The Dambuilders, Nation of Ulysses, Helium, Royal Trux, Antietam, Luna, Versus, The Magnetic Fields, and Dungbeetle.

 

Around the time their fourth album was released in 1999, Rachael and Chris got married, and Mike Galinsky had moved on to a successful career in filmmaking. Dan Cuddy (The Special Pillow, ex-Hypnolovewheel) joined Chris and Rachael on bass. With Dan on bass, Sleepyhead did some touring for The Brighter Shore and began writing new songs. Rachael and Chris moved from New York to Boston in 2002 after having their first child. (They had another kid in 2005.) By this time, they had begun recording a new album with producer Mike Deming (Pernice Brothers, Apples in Stereo, Beachwood Sparks, Lilys), at Deming’s famed Studio 45 in Hartford, and subsequently Enfield, CT. In 2004, bassist/vocalist/keyboardist Derek Van Beever joined the band and they’ve been playing shows in Boston, Providence, and New York ever since.

The band had a large fan base in what was sometimes called ""the three Bs"": Boston, Buffalo, and Belgium.
Vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aaron+Perrino]Aaron Perrino[/url] met drummer Shawn Sears in a music theory class at Oneonta State University in New York, and Sears ended up managing Perrino's band the Waverlys. Bass player Jim Gilbert was also a student at Oneonta. The trio three ended up in Boston independently. Waverlys broke up after Perrino moved to Boston, where he formed a new band, the Sheila Divine, with Jim Gilbert and a drummer (name unknown) in 1997. Shawn Sears quickly replaced the original drummer, and three months later, the trio scored a deal with [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Roadrunner+Records+(US)]Roadrunner Records[/url].
An eponymous five-track [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/861005]debut EP[/url] was issued in 1998 to establish the group's name prior to the 1999 release of their full-length debut, [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/701144]The New Parade[/url].
In late 2000, the band was hard at work on their second album when they added [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Colin+Decker]Colin Decker[/url] as a second guitarist to broaden their sound. From 1996 to 2000 Decker was singer/guitarist in a band called Lincolnville (from Portland, Maine). At the time he had a day job as a sound engineer, mastering recordings for labels on a contract basis. He got to know the Sheila Divine when he was involved (although uncredited) in the mastering of the New Parade. Lincolnville broke up in June 2000, citing geographical constraints as the main reason. Decker had been living in Boston for some time and the progress of the band began to suffer as a result of the lengthy commute to Portland. Looking for a new band to play with, and not long after his exposure to the Sheila Divine, Decker was introduced to Jim Gilbert at the Middle East, Boston's legendary Rock club. He and the Sheila Divine got together to play and it clicked right away.
In April of 2001 the Sheila Divine released their second album, [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/671703]Where Have My Countrymen Gone[/url], through the [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Co-op+Pop+Records]Co-Op Pop[/url] imprint. Later that year in August, Shawn Sears left the group to spend more time with his child. Following a handful of shows with fill-ins [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pete+Caldes]Pete Caldes[/url] and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Paul+Buckley]Paul Buckley[/url], drummer Ryan Dolan replaced Sears. Like Colin Decker, Dolan is also a former member of Lincolnville.
Unfortunately, Where Have My Countrymen Gone would prove to be the Sheila Divine's final LP. A six track EP, [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/671706]Secret Society[/url], was released through [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Arena+Rock]Arena Rock Recording Co.[/url] in September 2002. After that they embarked on a non-stop world tour, which would prove to be the band's undoing. While at a show in the mid-west a confrontation with Jim resulted in Aaron throwing his guitar down and announcing to the audience that the band was breaking up. Upon returning home, the band stated on their website they would not break up, but would instead take time off. Aaron Perrino started recording songs in the studio by himself, which would end up on the War Chords EP, the debut release of his new project, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dear+Leader]Dear Leader[/url] (which was intended to be a solo project, but later developed into a new band). The Sheila Divine officially announced their demise on their website in April of 2003, and played two farewell shows in October at The Paradise in Boston.
On December 31, 2005 The Sheila Divine played a reunion show at Bill's Bar in Boston. The band played as a three piece with Aaron, Jim and Ryan.

After two albums the band decided to part ways with Atlantic and went into relative musical seclusion.

The Gufs have reunited only selectively since the early 2000s. They released an album on a small label and performed a series of outdoor concerts with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. During the pandemic of 2020/1 the band wrote, recorded, and released a series of new singles without ever being in the same room. 

The band took their name from the 1980's cult classic ""The Seventh Sign"", a movie about the end of the world. The ""Guf"" is the hall of souls in heaven. They were inducted into the Wisconsin Music Hall of Fame in 2012.

[a=Shirlé Hale] had recently left her bass duties with riot grrrl band [a=Womyn of Destruction]. Her boyfriend, guitarist [a=David Koslowski] had just returned from a two month tour with his group [a=Liquor Bike]. He found a cassette of home recordings that Hale had put together in his absence. Hale was at work when he gave the 6 songs a listen. He was so impressed by the emotional depth of these tracks that he encouraged Hale to call upon their old friend [a=Miyuki Furtado] to play drums. Furtado knew Hale from their days of playing in the band Jag. The newly formed trio would enter the studio in July 1995 to cut some demos. Hale tagged the project Gerty, named for her moped, but also for Hale's love of Gertrude Stein.

[a1935761] quickly signed with Merkin Records and released the [i]Raggedy Aneurysm EP[/i] in the Fall of 1996. Spring of 1997 saw the group releasing their debut full-length, [i]Carload of Scenic Effects[/i], recorded with Drew Mazurek (Jawbox, Texas Is The Reason), which garnered rave reviews. [a1935761] hit the road in support of the record and while touring the Southeast the band made a big decision, they had fallen in love with the easy living and the camaraderie of the Chapel Hill, NC music scene. In the Spring of ’98, the band decided to leave their hometown of Baltimore and move South. One small problem was that drummer Furtado had fallen in love with his new girlfriend (now wife & mother of their beautiful daughter) and wanted to move to NYC for her new job. He would go onto to play bass and sing for the post-punk Brooklyn band [a=The Roger Sisters]. Hale & Koslowski were supportive of Furtado's decision, but opted to move and keep Gerty alive.

After settling in Chapel Hill and then Durham, NC the band recruited drummer [a=Laura King] ([a=Superchunk], [a=Bat Fangs], [a=R. Ring]) & bassist Justin Williams to help them finish their next record, [i]Two Kisses in a Row[/i]. The record was released on Koslowski’s own label, [l734463], in April 1999. The band had a very difficult tour in support of the record and decided to take a break. In May of 2000, Hale & Koslowski solidified their union & married after seven years of living & writing music together. While honeymooning in Europe, Hale & Koslowski decided break up [a1935761] as they had grown tired of band life, touring and plans for their third album weren't forming as they had hoped.

In 2001, Hale & Koslowski started doing some home recording on an 8-Track Tape Machine with Koslowski doing the engineering. This would become the nucleus of the third [a1935761] release, [i]Sweets from the Minibar[/i]. The now-reformed duo contacted producer [a=Chris Stamey] ([a308018], [a=Pylon], [a=Le Tigre]) to help finish up the recordings. This saw the group working with more electronic sounds, drum machines & tape loops while still using organic instrumentation. In Spring 2002, the band signed with the indie label, [l80701], which released the record in September 2002. At this point, [a1935761] had essentially become Hale & Koslowski with a revolving cast of players: [a=Maria Albani] ([a=Schooner], [a=Organos]), Rafi Goldberg, [a=Marc Faris], [a=Chris Eubank] ([a=Shark Quest]), [a=Mitch Easter] ([a256974]) & [a=Jon Wurster] ([a=Superchunk]) to help them record and/or tour.

The duo recorded a Christmas EP with producer [a=Zeno Gill] called [i]Three for the Holiday[/i], which was released on his label, [a256974] in the Winter of 2003. Hale & Koslowski headed back into the studio with Gill to record the follow up record, [i]Dance The Swivel Hips[/i], but unfortunately it never saw the light of day. In 2005, Hale & Koslowski decided to move on from the group after 10 years and finally put [a1935761] to bed. After a short hiatus the duo formed a new shoegazey alternative band called [a=Free Electric State]."

The band comprising the bass-free duo of [a278763] [vocals, guitar, keyboards] and [a367269] [drums, percussion]. The Whites, once married and divorced in March 2000, formed their lo-fi garage band in 1997. They officially ceased to perform in Feb 2011.

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

All new songs were written and demoed with Charles Bissell of the Wrens. Shows were played and a full length CD was recorded with Adam Lasus at Fireproof Studios. Piatt left town to teach for a semester and Josh Weil filled in on bass. Later Piatt returned and Brown left the band, after months of consideration, and a tour as a trio, Weil accepted the offer to join on guitar and vocal in 2001, During preparations to record a new album, FitzGerald, then Piatt and Weil left the band, leaving only Standish to finish the album and release it with the help of other friends of the band. 

Some reviews:

North Sea Story / Working for Wellness / 
North Sea Story's music is nice, blustery, melodic punk rock. If I wanted to, I could probably get away with applying a certain three-letter description that begins with ""e"" and ends with ""o""...but I won't.  The crashing guitars and indie rock furor you'll find here is rather unlikely to surprise you, though elements of post-rock progression in tunes like ""80 Through Ohio"" and ""The Last Wound-UP"" keep the proceedings from going too far up Boring Cookie-Cutter Rock Music Street.  In addition to sounding great, this apparently self-released CD is beautifully packaged in a lovingly designed yet affordably minimal cardboard slipcase -- the sort that makes you super-eager to open it and get at the indie-rock treasure inside.  Fans of Paul Newman (the band) will love it.

North Sea Story - Working For Wellness
Being an old fart, I've become accustomed to looking for influences when listening to newer bands. You may be asking yourself what that character flaw of mine has to do with anything - well, let me finish. North Sea Story may or may not have ever even heard some of my favorite bands from the late 80's, but that doesn't mean they don't fit nicely in between my Frontier and Twin/Tone albums. 

North Sea Story play songs with a cheerful sort of aggression. There's nary an ounce of anger on this disc, but a lot of sugar sweetness masquerading itself as post-punk, emo, or whatever else you want to tag it. I'm finding it hard to decide whether or not what they're doing is a decade out of style or if it's the very beginning of a renaissance I wasn't even expecting. 
""High Water Mark"", with it's dual guitar interplay, pounding beat, and fist-pumping chorus, is a perfect example of what this album's all about. More or less, Working For Wellness is a soaring anthem from beginning to end. Let's hope they'restarting something rather than finishing it.

NORTH SEA STORY ""Working For Wellness"" CD (self release)
I'm taking it that the North-East is going through this pop thing now a days, but it's sort of folk R.E.M/ LIVE sounding. Anyway, you've got this band...They're straight up pop, the style reminds me of what people used to consider indie-pop in the early 90's. When R.E.M. were reaching their top time and Super Chunk were getting noticed. This is not so much punk but with definite distorted  guitars and rocking parts. It's a little too ""MTV"" sounding at times if you know what I mean but it's something i could see rub off on me if i listened to it enough. I really like a song on here entitled ""Bicentennial Quarters"". On this song they added violins and such which i think is good for them. You get 10 spanking songs and this is not so bad, so go check it out.(JK) 

NORTH SEA STORY - Working For Wellness, Self Released, CD (1999)
WHEN PORTLAND OREGON'S Dharma Bums broke up in 1992 I was bummed for a year (maybe more). Listening to Brooklyn NY's NORTH SEA STORY makes up for my loss every time I spin Working For Wellness. They're not a BUMS clone. Its the uncanny similarity by both singers (Chris Standish and David Brown) to that of Jeremy Wilson--and that for me is a good thing to listen to. Even better, is that  they do in fact have their own style. Dynamically the songs are set in a particular mood. One that arrives the listener at a beginning-middle-end. The drama that unfolds from rock tempo'd songs like ""High Water Mark"" and ""Butterknife"" are things of many happy returns. Same's true for the notesnatching crafty emittences of the locked down jug of ""80 through Ohio."" But I suppose what I like best about Working For Wellness is their ability to change moods without sacrificing taste. Delivering a spirited run of 11 tracks of guitar rock brushed slightly with an artful eye.

Delusions of Adequacy
First, let me say that this is one of the best produced and packaged self-released albums that I've seen and heard in quite some time. The packaging is very subtle yet attractive, and the sound quality is impeccable. North Sea Story, despite having a very emo name, aren't really emo. The band plays long rock songs with strong rhythm, dazzling guitars, and interesting vocals. Sometimes sounding country, sometimes southern, sometimes just passionate, the vocals here are mixed up front enough to shine. At times the southern feel distracts me from the music itself, but it's easy to overlook that after a few listens.

""Pigeon Falls"" sounds like a more rocking Jayhawks song. On this song most of all, the singer's voice sounds very southern or Americana rock. ""80 Through Ohio"" is quite a beautiful rock song, the guitar work just amazing here, flowing and riff-intensive, the vocals rising and falling quite impressively, building to a scream by the end of the song  as the drums and bass build along. But the band proves they can play slower, prettier songs as well, such as the six-minute ""Bicentennial Quarter,"" complete with soft and pretty guitars and strings just barely audible in the background. Similar loud rockers like ""Just Like the Movies"" contrast with the more restrained and quiet numbers, like ""Longshoreman's Vote."" Elements of popular artists like Counting Crows can be heard here, but I'm more thrilled by the feeling of bands like Sordid Humor and Engine 88. ""Butterknife"" is a good example of the band's style, rocking hard but slowing down at parts, the vocals strained almost to the point of a scream but restrained throughout, the guitars driving along throughout. ""Open Invitation"" is slow and moving, slowly speeding and intensifying, at times both pretty and intense.

So, I don't really know anything about the band themselves, other than the fact that, despite the southern sounding vocals, the band is from Brooklyn, N.Y. Strings fill in the empty spaces, as does soft piano, but, primarily, NSS is a rock band. Falling somewhere between indie rock and emo rock with a harder rocking emphasis at times, North Sea Story could be a radio friendly band if they every played anyone quite this good. They would go a long way toward breaching the gap between some very different styles of rock as well.

North Sea Story 
Working For Wellness
This is surely one of those discs that you love the second your ears here the melodic wonder. The mix of cello and repetitive guitar work reminds me of a slowed down Jimmy Eat World. Its  emotionally driven heart filled music that's enough to leave you floating in space, forgetting all the pains of life. It was enough for me to forget about the surgery I had been through. The throbbing just seemed to fade, as if the music was some sort of God sent healing remedy. I might be getting a little carried away here, but I really like this music. I have only listened to the first song by this point.  Its titled ""Pigeon Falls"" and it's certainly a masterpiece, enough to get this band popular (in what ever way moving, emotional music can be).

Ooops… I put the cd player at random and I am now listening to track 10. Wow…still sounds pretty good. My guess right now is that it sounds pretty good the whole way through. Let me go ahead and change it back to track 2. Yep it sounds pretty good. The only flaw I can see is that the vocals seem sort of dull and you can't hear them very good. The instrumentation is what caught me here anyway. This stuff really doesn't need vocals, but I guess they just decided to add it in. The tone is just really nice sounding on the guitar and even though it is repetitive and some what simple (like most emo). It's addicting and very lovable. If I were to go comparing this to some other bands I would have to say it sounds most like, Pedro The Lion, Saint Sophia and slow Jimmy Eat World and Sunfactor. The strings in the music almost makes it sound like classical music only not.

Actually these guys aren't just slow like I originally thought. I was just listening to the slow songs because I was still on random. They actually have a lot of diversity. See, they keep getting better and better. The vocals still aren't my favorite, but if you are more of a fan of the instrumental part of emo music, then I would bet you might want to go pick this one up. It comes in a cardboard  cover, which I found to be pretty neat. I'm not sure that's the way it usually comes, but it could be. I'm also not sure who their record label is. I will have to figure it out. If you want this cd I would try emailing them or sending them snail mail.

He spent most of his life as a singer-songwriter touring the world and working with such companies as Universal, WB, and Capitol Records. His music has appeared in films and on several TV networks such as MTV and CBS, as well as on records with other artists such as John Mayer and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

In 2008, Justin made his directorial debut in the film, “CALL+RESPONSE"". This “rockumentary” film was theatrically distributed and become one of that year’s top documentaries. The film combined commentary by social luminaries, such as Cornel West, Madeleine Albright, and Nicholas Kristof with musical performances by artists such as Moby, Natasha Bedingfield, Cold War Kids, and Matisyahu.

Justin followed up with producing the CNN documentary “Common Dreams”. In the film, Justin and Grammy award winning hip-hop artist, Common, travel to Haiti to experience for themselves the plight of the estimated 300,000 children working as domestic servants. The film aired worldwide to over 240 million homes.

In 2011, Dillon founded the website Slavery Footprint. Partnering with the U.S. State Department, they launched a multiple-award-winning website that asks the question, “How Many Slaves Work For You?” The website and associated mobile app, allows consumers to visualize how their consumption habits are connected to modern-day slavery and provides them with an opportunity to have a conversation with the companies that manufacture the goods they purchase. Last year, President Obama acknowledged his organization’s work in his speech on slavery to the Clinton Global Initiative.

Dillon has appeared on and been covered by CNN, Katie Couric, Dr. Phil, MSNBC, New York Times, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Ad Week, CBS, Fox, NPR, Washington Post, Rolling Stone, Fast Company and others. He has spoken at the White House, UN, Clinton Global Initiative, Global Philanthropy Forum, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and many other venues.

A couple of months later they hooked up with guitarist Josiah Mazzaschi who came in to eat at the restaurant Kristen was waitressing at. Soon after, the trio was practicing in a basement in the burgeoning Wicker Park section of Chicago, & MotorHome was on its way. Although barely out of school, MotorHome have culled a sizable loyal following in their hometown. Laura, Kristen & Josiah each bring a different musical element to the band, with Kristen leaning towards a strong sense of melody & sweet sounding vocals. Josiah, whom the Chicago Sun-Times recently called "" one of the most creative guitarists in town"", prefers heavier guitar sounds and intricate rhythm changes. He often has a small group of sound fiends standing at his feet at shows to see how he creates his noises. Laura, as well, frequently grabs audience members attention with her flamboyant, heavy-hitting drum style. Together, they create a dynamic, distorted pop sound with a distinctiveness all their own.

Motorhome released their debut single on dirt in the fall of '94, featuring "" Whole In My Head"" / "" SugarLow"". Bringing the band the attention of several rock critics in Chicago, the single was also voted one of the best 7""'s of the year by Chicago NewCity writer Ben Kim, which helped to quickly sell out the initial pressing. Favorable reviews also poured in through both word of mouth and in print about their energetic live shows. ""Creative sonic distortions with an irresistible, subversive pop sound"" is how one writer aptly described MotorHome's sound. The band's much anticipated debut CD, entitled ""Sex Vehicle,"" came out in 1995. Recorded with Dave Trumfio at Kingsize Studios in Chicago, the record featured a whopping 21 tracks. ""Sex Vehicle"" is a sonic kaleidoscope that ranges from heavy hitting guitar-drenched songs to instantly catchy, hook-filled, dreamy pop tunes. It also included a few four track gems that the band have culled from songs they have recorded at their home studio, including a few songs that utilize a cool sounding hand-made microphone crafted by Josiah. The scope of the album reflects the diversity of MotorHome's music, as well as the distinctive styles that each of its members brings to the band.

After 1994's ""Pass and Stow"" LP, Chriest left the band and was replaced by Sean Meadows (of [a=June Of 44]).  Beginning with 1998's ""Artificial Horizon"", Nathan Bell took over as bassist but Meadows return for 2003's ""Love Is Love"" LP.

The band is often also cited as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous."

After regional punk rock heroes Shyster called it quits in 1999, singer/songwriter Mike Levin decided to start over. This time he chose to incorporate his own influences, such as grass roots folk and classic soul, along with his already fortified punk roots to produce a more melodic, soulful approach. And so The New Lows was born.

In 2002, Levin moved to New York City, put together a new lineup, and quickly hit the circuit playing as many shows as possible. In 2008, The New Lows recorded their second full length release, ""Atlantic/Pacific,"" with former Shyster bassist Wes Snowden and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion drummer Russell Simins. Filled with hard-charging riffs, beautiful harmonies, and resonating lyrics, the album was met with great reviews and proved to be a fortuitous launching point for what was to come.

Following the release, Levin decided to return to Florida. He soon assembled local players, drummer Gregg Lightfoot and guitarist/keyboardist Bobby Pino, to join him and Snowden. After playing continuously for the last two years, the group went to acclaimed New Orleans recording studio The Living Room to record their next album. The anxiously anticipated ""I Couldn't Sleep"" was released November 13, 2012. It's available for purchase on Bandcamp, iTunes, and Amazon.

In the summer of 2013, The New Lows embarked on a 3-week tour around the U.S. Shortly after, Lightfoot left the band and was replaced by ex-VRGNS drummer Eric Pitman. In October 2013, ""I Couldn't Sleep"" was released on split-colored, limited-edition vinyl (500 copies) on Kiss of Death Records and The New Lows played a packed show at FEST 12 in Gainesville, Florida."

The group has played with a diverse range of acts such as Beck, the Boredoms, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, Faith No More, Jad Fair, and Sun City Girls.
Befuddled attempts to label the band bring comparisons to Frank Zappa, Pere Ubu, and Captain Beefheart, but they somehow fall short of the carnival of sights, smells and sounds that is Three Day Stubble. Brut cologne, pyroflatulance, dijiridoos, trombone, platform shoes, trumpet, drool, bizarre keyboards, and teeny tiny drumkit swirl in a thick stew of guitars peppered with Donald's inimitable vocal stylings.
Three Day Stubble shows the glory and horror of white American culture turned inward upon itself, and the incestual expulsive ramifications of our democratic free society. Three Day Stubble's hobby is showing the struggle of backward egos from a relatively tame society, that would rather turn away from looking at their problems and delude themselves while acting out the eccentric behavior brought about by such ignorance. Stubble exposes this ""bubble life,"" never acknowledged by society, through music, dancing, and other entertainment. These guys are making way to allow and encourage the acceptance of individual expression and creativity, no matter how secret or personal.
The band refers to its music as 'nerd rock,' but that fails to capture the depth and scope of Three Day Stubble's strangeness. The impression begins with the band's attire, such as it is: eye -bendingly bad combinations of thrift store relics from the 70's that make David Lindley look like a GQ model. The nerd reference might strike closer with the musicians' earnestly goofy expressions. Still these guys make Bill Murray's ultimate ""Saturday Night Live"" nerd, Todd de la Muca, seem socially adept.
Musically Three Day Stubble is similarly unique. Try to imagine a hybrid of Captain Beefheart's advanced rythmic/harmonic weaves, the naivete and inadvertant dadaisms of the Shaggs, and the ingratiating enthusiasm of, say, Kukla, Fran and Ollie. Still not close."

The second era (2002 - 2009) was almost exclusively instrumental electronica influenced by reggae and dub. The last decade up to and including 2021's Colorways has been a mixture of indie songwriting blended with electronica, a genre Climate has termed ""post smooth jazz""."

The original line-up was Mark on vocals, Matt on guitar, Dayton on drums, Chris on second guitar, and Jake on bass. The band's first show was on May 17th of that year, an opening slot for TEN YARD FIGHT. Shortly thereafter, the Proc entered Brian McTernan's noted Salad Days studio to record its self-titled demo cassette. Reactions were good, but over a 2-month span in late '96/early '97, 3 members decided to call it a day. Matt and Mark were still eager to keep going; so with the blessing of the other guys they kept the name and the existing songs, and pressed forward. Proclamation resurfaced in April of 1997 with the line-up that went on to appear on the Straight Edge Hardcore 7"": Mark on vocals, Matt on guitar, Aaron on drums, Brian on bass, and Jason on second guitar. It was during this phase that the band first began showing signs of turning toward a faster, more aggressive sound. Bridge Nine Records, who had initially shown interest in the Proc on the merits of the demo, re-contacted them about the possibility of recording a release for the label; so, in November of 1997 the band recorded the aforementioned 7"". It was at this time that Brian left to focus on his other band, THE TRUST, which later became heavyweights DOWN BUT NOT OUT. Jeremiah stepped in and became Proclamation's permanent bassist. This line-up played together for approximately 8 months, at which time Aaron and Jason moved to other parts of the country. At this point, a concentrated search for heavy-duty players netted Nate Straight, drummer extraordinaire from OPEN UP, and longtime band friend/shredder Lee ""Cannibal"" Corbin on guitar. The band dropped out of sight for months and recorded its CD, Taken By Force, before finally playing out again in April, 1999. This incarnation of the band proved to be the most stable, lasting about a year and a half until the Proc's demise in late 2000."

Influenced by bands such as Entombed, Machine Head, and Pantera; Lungbrush started hitting the Chicago scene. In '96 Troy Moore was replaced by Chris Williams and the band recorded their first album ""Your Loss Your Cost"" on Pulverizer Records. In '97 Chris Williams quit the band and Rob Pandola was replaced by Ricardo Salinas. They scored their first Metro show opening for Suicidal Tendencies, and started writing music for their next album. In '98 Lungbrush won a contest out of hundreds of bands to open for Slayer and Fear Factory at the Aragon Ballroom. The same year the band recorded their second album ""Old School New School"" for independent label, and started headlining the Metro. Recruiting bands such as Relative Ash, Disturbed, and Soil to open for them. ""Old School New School"" was re-released in March 1999 on Pavement Records. After that, the band played San Antonio's Metal Fest and went on tour w/Turmoil and All Out War and also did spot dates and opened up for bands like D.R.I., S.O.D., Skinlab, Snot, Machine Head, Voivod, Accept and many others throughout 2000 & 2001. After a seven year run and one more demo recording, Lungbrush broke up in 2002. Roach moved to Florida and was in ""Rising Up Angry"" with old guitarist Chris Williams. Jeff Holmes and Jon Billman are currently in Chicago-based band ""EMETIC"".

Lungbrush was always about unity in the Chicago scene. They helped out any band they could and are responsible for getting Chicago Metal back into one of the best clubs in Chicago, The Metro. In March 2009, Troy Coates passed away from adrenal gland cancer. Throughout his entire battle with cancer, he continued to write and perform, up until the week before he died. He will be forever revered as the ""Godfather of Chicago Metal""."

Frequent line up changes would continue but the core of the band would remain Randy Larsen, Vic Szalaj, and Bernie Romanowski.  2nd guitarist Ben Cowles joined in 2001 and played through 2003.  Aaron Lewis was the 2nd guitarist on 2004's ""Pigs Never Fly"".  Bernie was replaced by Chris Fischkelta shortly after the recording of ""Pigs Never Fly"".  Vocalist Peter Farris joined the band in 2003.  In 2006, Cable released ""Last Call"", which was a career-spanning retrospective that was thought to be their last release, but the band reunited once again and released another album on The End Records in 2009 called ""The Failed Convict.  The band returned in 2019 with the album ""Take The Stairs to Hell"" which featured Randy Larsen, Bernie Romanowski, Chris Fischkelta, Peter Farris and new drummer Alex Garcia-Rivera (replacing Vic Szalaj, previously the only member remain through every phase of the group)."

Anderson doing programming and vocals and Brian Shrader on the guitar. Soon after, they recorded ""Evil Inside,"" their first demo. Combining the cold, synth sound of techno with the angry brutality of metal and mixing in a political message, the music created was innovative and full of depth. Spread through underground sources, and along the internet, the band began to pick up a growing number of followers. There was enough interest sparked that the band was invited to re-record their songs for a European produced album. Unfortunately, the the album never came together, and the newly recorded tracks were made into ""Script Kiddie."" Work began on a completely new album. ""[r=246758]"" (aka SoFTeR) was released in 2001. Years of work had started to pay off. The Shizit was featured on [a=Alec Empire]'s ""[r=109887]"" compilation, and soonafter was touring with Alec Empire himself in Europe. A third member, Jason Alberts, was added to the group as a full time turntablist. 

Unfortunately, in early 2003, the Shizit called it quits, with no explanation. It seems that the cliched ""musical differences"" has struck again. A posthumous album was released on [l=D-Trash Records], with artists remixing the ""Soundtrack For The Revolution"" album as ""[r=248006]"".

After long silent hiatus, in October 2009 The Shizit  announced comeback (this time only with J.P. Anderson as a member) and released a new selftitled album which is available for free download. 

In January 2010 former member Brian Shrader sent cease and desist letters to D-Trash Records and Glitch Mode Recordings for unauthorized use of ""The Shizit"" trademark on recordings unauthorized by his share in the partnership.

2005059,1058907,8919145,US,Spite (3),Bastard Complex,1999,0.0,12,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Hardcore', 'Noise', 'Alternative Metal']","[b]SPITE[/b] was an alternative/groove metal/hardcore quartet formed in early 1993 in Charlotte, NC. The band was put together by vocalist Chris Boone and guitarist David Vause, who auditioned a few different drummers and bass players before settling down with Jay Bynum (bass) and Michael Pressley (drums). The band also had 2nd guitar player briefly in late 1993 and that line-up recorded 3 song demo. Their early sound was reminiscent of early Clutch and early Rollins Band, being booth groovy and aggressive.

With the 2nd guitar out of the band, the quartet started recording Spite debut full length called ""Crucial Moment of Insertion"" sometime in 1994 at a studio in Charlotte. At the moment of recording the album, the band also recorded a live show at a club in Charlotte and decided to include 3 tracks from that show on the album. Around this time, Spite original drummer Michael decided to leave the band. Luckily, they met Byron McDonald through a mutual friend who had played with him in a band called [b]Child of Rage[/b]. Byron was actually at the show Spite recorded live for the album — they had already asked him to join and it was Spite's original drummer's last show with the band. After Byron joined Spite, they immediately started writing new songs and went back to the studio to record 2 more tracks with Byron. He is featured on album's tracks ""Closed"" and ""Give"". Spite debut album ""Crucial Moment of Insertion"" was finally released in 1995 on independent record label HeadChairMusic.

With debut album released and being well received by the audience, there were negotiations with labels in Europe about a record deal, but in the summer of 1996, due to different ideas about the musical direction of the band, founding member David Vause and Jay Bynum decided to part ways with Chris and Byron. The remaining members soon recruited Josh Pratt on bass and John Crumpton took over on guitar. That was the lineup that recorded Spite follow up album, ""Heavy Whipping Cream"", released in 1997 on Opulence! Records.

After album release, Spite decided to promote the album, so they toured the East Coast relentlessly, eventually landing a recording contract with Prosthetic Records. The band was about to start working on their national debut album, ""Bastard Complex"", but not before another changes in line-up. John Crumpton left the band, and was quickly replaced by Dan Young, formerly of [b]Catharsis[/b]. Being of punk hardcore background, Dan brought noisier element to Spite music, making it sound more frenetic and hardcore, that previous Spite outputs.

Their national debut album (and by vast majority of audience considered as a Spite debut), ""Bastard Complex"", was released in 1999 both on Prosthetic Records and Metal Blade Records. It featured 12 tracks total, with 4 of them already appearing on previous album, and now being re-recorded with new line up. Dan Young was listed as LiveFastDanYoung in the album credits, a play on ""Live Fast, Die Young"" quote - which sadly was a foreshadowing of what was to come. Dan passed away from an overdose on 1st August, 1999.

With album being released worldwide, and wanting to promote it, the band quickly find temporary replacement in Craig Baker from [b]Buzzov•en[/b] before settling on Dave Campbell as a new guitar player. Spite played numerous shows in attempt to move things further, but eventually came to a halt not long after, somewhere in 2000.

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Dan Miller stepped in as singer, Chris Dorame covered bass, Zach Vodola provided the guitar work, and Jarred Pacheco offered pounding rhythm with his drums. Wild shows in and around California helped the young band build a following almost overnight. The same year of its formation, the foursome put together a debut offering for its fans, Fist to Face. Crawl ""420"" delivers extreme heavy rock seasoned with leftover thrash, the kind of stuff that invites the use of a mosh pit; this is music that isn't for those faint of heart, or those with sensitive sensibilities.

In 1997, a sophomore release, Crawl ""420"" Green, hit the market. It was followed in 1999 by the album Severe and then in 2000 by Killmercial. Some of the tracks heavy metal fans can sample from these recordings are ""Unforgiven,"" ""Slime,"" ""Head in Only,"" ""Fucko,"" ""Beer,"" ""Frump,"" ""Last Mistake,"" ""Erase,"" and ""Greed."" Over the years the band has opened for groups including DRI 2x, Exodus, Flotsam, Man-O-War, Obituary, Sacred Reich, SOD, and Testament.

In early 2001, the band went through a couple of major changes. Probably the biggest one was a change in the lineup. Guitarist Zach Vodola called it quits with the group and went out on his own. Guitarist Joe Young, who had been a onetime member of the group Comatose, replaced Vodola. The next big change was the name of the band. The members decided to do away with the ""420"" ending and just become known as Crawl.

Crawl never went beyond the name change and later disbanded in Late 2001.

In 2023, Crawl 420 reunited. "

They were in a band called ""Oblivion"" and changed the name over to SPiNE. After line up changes and two demos they released their first album ""The Dirty Sanchez"" in March of 1999, followed by their second album ""Non-Violent Offender"" two years later. SPiNE parted ways in 2002.
After the group disbanded Jennifer J. Arroyo went on to play in Kittie, Johnny 3 Legs formed many bands after, Such as God is Dead, Gaffler, and Wrong House. The rest of the crew Mike Bossier & Michael Spiers formed a band called Audio Terror Regime.

Beginning with ""The Two Mikes"" - Guitarists Mike Bossier and Drummer Mike Speirs - the SPiNE mission became a journey through the re-emergence of the hard rock world, and it's final line-up borne out of the most fertile breeding ground of heavy music - the D.C. scene. Self-described as ""Heavy slam Hip-Hop for the Masses""; SPiNE encompasses the latest hunger for heavy music with their own unique twists and turns.

SPiNE's introspective and machine gun precise guitarist, Mike Bossier, originally conceived SPiNE as a side project in addition to his then band, Oblivion. When a trip to L.A. with the promises of rock stardom and a contract with a well-know label didn't pan out, Mike - who had now been joined by the other Mike - decided to make SPiNE a full their full time project. ""The fans were digging SPiNE more at that point,"" reveals Bossier, ""I feel freer with SPiNE, and Mike Spiers has the perfect intense powerhouse drumming for it."" With Mike Speirs' eclectic background ranging from being a rabid Neil Peart fan (and able to give him a run for his drumming money) to a stint playing for KC & The Sunshine Band, Bossier had in Speirs the massive backbone needed for SPiNE.

The two Mikes went back to Washington D.C. and concentrated on the quest to find the right bassist and vocalist for SPiNE. After various incarnations (including long time member and 2nd vocalist Sean Goodwin), the final lineup would include bassist/ vocalist Jennifer Arroyo and vocalist/ rapper Johnny 3 Legs.

Johnny 3 Legs, who towers over the rest of the band at over 6 ½ feet, was influenced by Cool Mo' D and Run DMC. ""Comin' from a redneck hair band lovin' town, I got beat up a lot as a kid. But I got a karaoke machine, and started rappin' over it. I thought maybe it would help me get the chicks."" Basketball worked better for Johnny in that department, and world almost lost one of the most entertaining and talented performers it's seen in a long time to the hoops.

However, Johnny started to get into heavier music; (""The Deftones are my gods"") including Biohazard, Urban Discipline, Cromags, etc. Rapping at a party, Johnny was invited to join Buddah Kiss, whom he made one record with. He even won a rapping contest at The House of Blues, in New Orleans! Being hard to miss in looks and sheer hardcore stage charisma, Bossier spotted Johnny and invited him to join SPiNE.

Tough, sexy, and oozing talent and personality, Jennifer Arroyo - originally from Staten Island - was infected by the band Biohazard at an early age 15, Jennifer switched to bass and because she preferred a rhythmic instrument, and had ideas on how to musically use the bass in different ways. While in the band Open Defiance, Jennifer played a show with SPiNE, and Johnny 3 Legs videotaped Jennifer, later hitting on her as well. Despite that, SPiNE became Jennifer's favorite band, and when they invited her to join she jumped at the chance. ""How could I say no? It is a real joy to play with such phenomenal musicians.""

Johnny has this to say about the bands message: ""We try to look at the intense subjects we sing about as positivity through negativity. Also, solving problems internally, not externally. In other words, if things are too much for you - deal with it within yourself, not by being destructive, or taking it out on someone else."" Overall, as a group, their genuine passion for music shows through in every one of them. They are unreservedly committed to bringing SPiNE's music to every corner of the planet. Their debut release on Revo Records is slated for an early 2001 release, with their first tour beginning in February 2001.

Having already become a hit on the D.C. rock scene, they also have an extensive background performing at festivals and clubs with some of the rock's hottest bands. These include Coal Chamber, Korn, The Lunachicks, Megadeth, Fear Factory, Flotsam and Jetsam, and many others. The year 2001 will be the year when SPiNE will take its rightful place among these acts as the rulers of the New Metal."

The name Ratt came into being in the beginning of the 1980s, although the band's roots can be traced back to the mid '70s and the band [a=Mickey Ratt], which was fronted by vocalist Stephen Pearcy.  By 1983, after cycling through a number of different musicians and relocating to Los Angeles, where they would play a large part in the growing glam scene, the ""classic"" line-up of Pearcy, guitarists Warren DiMartini and Robbin ""King"" Crosby, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby ""Blotz"" Blotzer was in place.  From 1984 through 1990, the band would record and release 5 commercially successful albums.  By the turn of the decade, though, the band's fortunes were declining as popular tastes in music were changing and Crosby, once one of the driving forces in the band, found himself mired in a heroin addiciton that ultimately led to his removal from Ratt.  After substituting guitarist Michael Schenker for Crosby for touring purposes, Ratt released what would be the final single of their initial run, ""Nobody Rides for Free"" (from the soundtrack for the movie ""Point Break"") in 1991 as a four-piece.  The following year, Pearcy and DiMartini left the band, effectively ending Ratt.

In 1997, the members met to discuss the possibility of a reunion.  Croucier declined to join and it was decided that Crosby was in no condition to participate (still suffering from drug addiction, the guitarist was severely overweight and HIV positive, a fact he would publicly disclose in 2001; he would die of a heroin overdose the following year).  Robbie Crane was brought in to replace Croucier and Pearcy would occasionally handle second guitar duties.  This line-up released a self-titled album in 1999 but it did not have the same commercial success as their previous releases.  Pearcy left the band the following year and began touring as ""Ratt featuring Stephen Pearcy"".  This led to lawsuit over right to the name ""Ratt"" between the singer and Blotzer and DiMartini, from which the latter two emerged victorious, although the issue of the rights to the name remains a point of contention for all the surviving members of the classic line-up.   

Blotzer and DiMartini would tour throughout the first half of the 2000s under the Ratt banner with several different vocalists and second guitarists before reuniting with Pearcy in 2006.  In 2009, the band, with Robbie Crane still playing bass and former [a=Quiet Riot] guitarist Carlos Cavazo on board, recorded the well-received LP ""Infestation"".  However, owing to tensions between the members, the band announced that it would be going on indefinite hiatus the following year.  In 2012, Crane announced that he was no longer a part of Ratt.  Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Juan Croucier had returned to the group.  In the spring of 2014, Pearcy announced that he was leaving the band again, citing unresolved personal and business tensions.  In the summer of 2015, both Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier launched separate touring projects for the purpose of performing Ratt songs, with Blotzer stating the DiMartini refused to participate in any Ratt-related touring unless it included Pearcy and Croucier.  In late 2015, the drummer announced that his touring band was now the official version of Ratt.  Blotzer brought legal action against Croucier for touring as ""Ratt's Juan Croucier"" while DiMartini brought action against Blotzer for using the Ratt name.  In November 2016, the courts ruled that the Ratt name still belonged to the surviving members of Ratt's original partnership which was created in 1985.  With the announcement of this ruling, Pearcy, DiMartini, and Croucier announced that they were reuniting under the Ratt banner and expelled Blotzer from the partnership.  In 2018, Pearcy and Croucier announced that they were touring with an entirely new set of musicians, stating that DeMartini expressed a disinterest in participating.

They followed their victory at The Made In Rochester Competition in 1999 with the release of their debut disc, Crime Don’t Pay Yet!! in 2000.  The CD received airplay in the local showcases on stations in the Rochester, Syracuse, and Buffalo markets; and music from the album was used in commercials to promote the sports programming on WCMF 96.5 fm.
 
The band’s second disc, For A Dollar, was released in April of 2007.  This ten-song salute to Passion, Truth, Justice, and The American Way demonstrates their classic rock influences with songs that are raw reflections of modern life in the free world.
 
The instantly likeable What I Love About America was chosen as the Official Home Victory Song for the Rochester Red Wings, and is played after every win at Frontier Field.  The tune appears on the band's August 2012 EP release THRE3.

Earth to Andy is comprised of Andy Walbeck (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; vocals, guitar), Chris Reardon (Northern Virginia, USA; bass, vocals), Tony Lopacinski (Fairfax, VA, USA; guitar, vocals), and Kevin Murphy (Charlottesville, Virginia, USA; drums, vocals). Walbeck and Murphy first got together in the punk/funk band, Egypt. In 1996, Andy began to feel musically restricted by Egypt's style and began to seek new creative directions. He found it in local rivals, Reardon and Lopacinski, bass player and front man for the more melodic Red Henry. Although both bands had indie deals and loyal local followings, it was time for a change. 

Soon, Earth to Andy was cranking out a new sound comprised of muscular guitar rhythms formed with tight harmonic melodies. Comparisons quickly likened them to Stone Temple Pilots. However, the group's musical signature, growling guitars combined with group vocals, separated Earth to Andy from the typical hard rock sound. Their sound caught the attention of Giant Record's Jeff Aldrich, who signed the band after seeing them perform for the first time. After working in the studio with the technical command of Nick Launay (Semisonic, Silver Chair, Talking Heads) and the mixing of Chris Lord-Alge (Everclear, Fastball, Hole), Earth to Andy debuted in September, 1999 with Chronicle Kings. Their single ""Still After You"" (featuring STP's Robert Deleo) made its mark in radio rotations with its aggressive energy and power. Tracks like the sitar-laced brew ""Biting At My Heels"" to the full-frontal assault of ""Pollute"" and the guitar-driven punch of ""Sometimes"" should soon follow. This band is young and their future is bright. Currently they tour with the likes of Tonic, Vertical Horizon, and most recently Stone Temple Pilots.

Since 2018 there have been two versions of the band, one with classic members [a=Tracii Guns] and [a=Phil Lewis] and one with classic members [a=Steve Riley] and [a=Kelly Nickels]. In 2021, the incarnation with Riley and Nickels finally changed its name to [a=Riley's L.A. Guns] because of a lawsuit concerning the use of the band name.

L.A. Guns is an American rock band whose music is frequently associated with the L.A. glam metal scene which grew up around the Sunset Strip in the 1980s, in particular the sleaze rock subgenre. Guns N' Roses, which once featured three of the original L.A. Guns members, was the most prominent exponent of this subgenre, generally preferring an anti-social image to elaborate make-up and costumes. 

L.A. Guns was formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner.  Over the next couple years it would evolve into what became the original version of [a=Guns n' Roses].  Tracii Guns would depart that band in 1985 and launch a new version of L.A. Guns.  Throughout the years, a large number of musicians would pass through some version of the band (of which, at times, there have been two) and no single member would be consistently present at all times.  The band's longest-serving and best-known members are Tracii Guns, drummer Steve Riley (who joined the band in 1987 and is the closest thing to a constant member, having been in the band from 1987 until 1992, and again from 1994 until 2016), and vocalist Phil Lewis.  The L.A. Guns name is owned by both Tracii Guns and Steve Riley and both musicians have led their own versions of the band. Riley and Lewis led L.A. Guns from 1999 until 2016 while Guns had a second version of the band from 2006 to 2012.  In 2016, Lewis and Guns formed a new version of the band, while in 2018 Riley announced he had his own version which included one-time bassist Kelly Nickels.  In 2020, Lewis and Guns filed a lawsuit against Riley over the trademark to the L.A. Guns name after which a settlement was reached in which Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis would retained ownership of the L.A. Guns name while Steve Riley would use the name ""Riley's L.A. Guns"".

The first single ""L.I.N. Code"", soon after produced by the newborn label New Sound Records in Ferrara, came out simultaneously with the clip ""When The Reality Was Very Different"", focusing on the concept of fractal in all its manifestation.
These very first productions clearly show that multimediality was the preferred way of communicating of the band, enjoying the combination and dissociation of electro sounds, voice recording and 3D graphic art videos. This experiment draw the attention of the Italian TV  channel Videomusic, at the time very sensitive to alternative sounds. The band took part to several telecasts. In 1992, L.I.N. turned up in all Italy with ""The Fractal"", produced by KLF Music/Discomagic and the 2 videos ""Dd Sky"" and ""I See You"".
In 1993, after lots of months spent in the studio, ""Frames"" was recorded. The album has its roots in L.I.N.'s discography and it's really appreciated by [a=Adi Newton], inventor of [a=Clock DVA], who let the Venetian banb play with the famous from Sheffield in some of their Italian performances.
L.I.N. then left KLF Music, joined sub/mission producer in Florence and cooperate with [a=Paolo Favati] and [a=Maurizio Fasolo]. Together with the 2 past members of [a=Pankow], L.I.N. produced ""00 Mind"", containing a remix of [a=Lassigue Bendthaus] and featuring [a=Marcello Michelotti] by [a=Neon (10)] and the singles ""Web""  and ""Subterminal"" - remixed by [a=Test Dept.] [l=CGD East West] distributed them in Italy, [l=SPV GmbH]  in Europe. 
1999 was the turning point. After years of EBM experimentation, L.I.N. choose the pop way and recorded ""La Folie"" with [a=Gianni Maroccolo], bass-guitar in ""State Of The Art"".
10 years later, L.I.N. went back to studios to revisit ""00 Mind"" and ""The Fractal"", plus several inedited sounds supported by short movies as background. The album was  produced by [a=Giorgio Ricci (3)] and [a=David Loop].
One of [a=David Loop]'s latest passions is creating short movies with sampling images, a veiled and cinematographic evolution.

The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist [a251808] and bass guitarist [a374278] in the year 1983. Despite many line-up changes, Megadeth is partly responsible for the popularization of thrash metal in the late 1980s. The band was also notorious for its substance abuse, a contributing factor to their continuous revolving door of band members. The group nonetheless found sobriety and a stable line-up with 1990 release [m=32937], a trend which continued until 1998 with the departure of drummer Nick Menza. During that period, the band released four studio albums, including [m=32933], which is Megadeth's most commercially successful album.

Dave Mustaine disbanded Megadeth in 2002 due to a nerve injury he had suffered on his left arm. Following a year of physical therapy Mustaine began work on what was to be his first solo album, however contractual obligations forced [m=33085] to be released under the Megadeth name, following which, Mustaine decided to reform the band in 2004. The band has since released five studio albums, but continued to have several line-up changes through 2000s and 2010s, with Mustaine remaining the only constant member. Co-founder Ellefson, who took legal actions against the band during the disbandment, rejoined in 2010 but was fired from the band in 2021.

853668,0,9046851,US,From Zero,From Zero,1999,38.03,13,"['Album', 'Stereo']",['Rock'],"['Nu Metal', 'Hard Rock']","From Zero was a nu-metal group formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1998. Their music is distinguished from many earlier nu-metal groups with its greater focus on vocal harmonies, and correspondingly less elements of hip hop than groups like Limp Bizkit or Puya.

In 1999, the band independently released their self titled EP (referred to as ""The Green Album""). At this time, they were also opening for bands such as Amen, Disturbed, Nickelback and Nothingface.

They later signed with Arista Records, where they released two major label albums in One Nation Under (which features many re-recorded songs from their self titled album) (2001) and My So-Called Life (2003). They had two music videos which are for their songs ""Check Ya"" and ""Smack"", both of which can be viewed over on You Tube. Before the recording of My So-Called Life, bassist Rob Ruccia left the band to do production work on other bands, leaving vocalist Jett to record the bass for the album. They later recruited Avi Kopernik to play bass for the group's live shows.

After being dropped by Arista less than a month after the release of My So-Called Life, they went to work preparing for their third album. As time went on, writing music became a chore and Jett with nothing to fall back on, needed to concentrate on a day job to support his family. Joe Pettinato, who already had a construction business, then left the band, and the rest of the group called it quits in 2005. Two songs from the intended album, ""Middle of the Road"" and ""My Own Destiny"", can still be streamed on their official PureVolume page.
Although they have not gained widespread popularity within the music community as a whole, they are well recognized both in the Chicago area and among nu metal fans."

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Beth Wood is a modern-day troubadour, poet, and believer in the power of word and song. Beth has been writing, creating, recording, and touring full-time twenty-three years — delighting and inspiring audiences with her exceptional musicianship, intelligent songwriting, powerhouse voice, and warm and commanding stage presence.
A home-body with an ever-present wanderlust, an introvert with a passion for performing, a creative free-spirit with enough discipline to rework her dream year after year, Beth’s work has expanded to include teaching voice and song coaching as well as leading workshops at festivals, retreats and beyond. In addition to her eleven solo albums, one duo album, and one collaboration live album, Beth has released three books of poetry, Kazoo Symphonies and Ladder To The Light (2019 finalist for the Oregon Book Award Stafford/Hall award for poetry and 2019 Winner of the Oregon Book Award Readers’ Choice Award), and Believe The Bird, a collection of forthright, shimmering poems that examine the stories we tell ourselves. Beth also released Facepalm, a whimsical collection of stories recounting some of the most awkward conversations she has experienced on the road. (Mezcalita Press). Beth believes that engagement in the process of creation is as important as its outcome. Her musical philosophy is that there are no wrong notes.
Beth grew up in the musically-rich town of Lubbock, TX with her mom’s classical tapes playing in the car, her dad’s Willie Nelson records spinning in the living room, her brother’s Foreigner and Heart 8-track tapes blasting in his room, and her own little radio which she would hide under the covers and search late into the night for songs with women’s voices. Anne Murray’s “Songbird” broke something open in her that Bette Midler’s “The Rose” quickly filled up with tears while Karen Carpenter’s “Top of the World” and Captain and Tenille’s “Muskrat Love” delighted her to no end. And then came Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie, well that’s how an eight-year-old’s head explodes.
There have been awards. Beth’s skills in the craft of songwriting and poetry have been recognized by the prestigious Kerrville New Folk Award, The Sisters Folk Festival Dave Carter Memorial Songwriting Award, the Billboard World Song Contest, The Oregon Book Awards, and many more. There have been incredible and surreal moments in the spotlight: opening for Steve Winwood, Michael McDonald, Shawn Colvin, Chris Whitley; being a four-time featured artist on Cayamo, a week-long Caribbean songwriters’ cruise along with most of her living musical heroes; singing the national anthem for 42,000 people at a major league baseball game; discussing guitar tunings with David Crosby backstage at a festival; being featured on “Troubadour, TX”, a nationally syndicated documentary-style singer-songwriter reality television series airing in almost 40 million households and 140 U.S. markets.
What matters to Beth more than awards or sales or big spotlight moments is connecting with people through music and words night after night. Her dream is move something with her art, whether it’s a swirling emotion or a curious mind or tapping feet. Her mission is to communicate the joy she feels when she opens her mouth and sings. That may not be the glamorous part but it is the engine that keeps this stubborn and determined artist on the road year after year. It’s what keeps the songs coming and the words turning. It’s what keeps her dreaming in music at night.
Beth lives in Sisters, OR with her loyal dog Bailey and is continuously writing and rewriting her artist’s manifesto. Beth has immersed herself in the northwest music community through her work on staff with the Sisters Folk Festival Americana Song Academy and as long-time host of the Sisters Folk Festival Sunday Community Celebration.

The West Coast Voice…

Guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter, Peter Mayer has been quietly and steadily building a fervent following around the globe, stepping out of the shadow of his boss, Jimmy Buffett, into his own with a fresh songwriting and performing style.

Accompanied by bassist John Eatmon from Ft. Lauderdale; drummer Roger “Scotch” Guth; and guitarist Vince Varvel from St. Louis, Missouri, Peter delivers honest revealing music that blends originality with accessibility, bound together by a virtuoso ensemble sound that makes it all seem easy.

While Peter Mayer is a portent of music for the coming millennium, he and his band are hardly fresh faced newcomers. The foursome boast between them an extensive performing and songwriting portfolio with experience in any number of styles from jazz to country, rock to classical.

Recording under the name PM, Peter released an eponymous debut album for Warner Bros. in 1988 with Elliot Scheiner (Steely Dan, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Hornsby) produced single “Piece of Paradise” reaching #8 on the Billboard chart. Despite the top ten single, major tours with both “Moody Blues” and “Chicago”, and rave national media reviews, Peter and his band got lost in the Warner Brothers bureaucracy…. perhaps a blessing in disguise.

When Scheiner was hired to produce Buffett’s “Off to See the Lizard” album, he suggested that Jimmy use PM for the recording sessions. Buffett was so impressed with their unique versatility as musicians and performers that he quickly hired them as part of his own “Coral Reefer Band”, a successful relationship that continues to date.

“I had no idea what to expect or what I was getting into,” said Mayer. “I’m not sure if it was me who brought Roger and Jim, or the other way around, but we thought it would be a fun thing to do while we shopped for a new record deal. I remember sitting in my hotel room before the session thinking, ‘I should really listen to this guy before the session,’ and put on Jimmy’s ‘Floridays’ album. ‘Creola’ came on and I thought, ‘Hey, that’s really nice.’ We went on over to the Hit Factory recording studio, and the first thing Jimmy said was, ‘So this is my new band.’

Since that first meeting, Peter has become a favorite to watch and listen to. In addition to the busy schedule with JB, Peter still manages to write and record his own band materials, made evident by such great CD’s as “Street of Dreams”, “Red Wine and Lemonade”, and the very popular “Green Eyed Radio”.

Peter hails from Tamilnadu, the far southern region of India, where his parents served as missionaries for seventeen years before returning to their Missouri roots. Musical influences from that period of his life can be heard in his playing. Peter recalls, “I can remember Indian musicians giving Christmas concerts in my parent’s house; wildly playing drums and flutes, shakers and bells…. they would go on for hours and hours.” Peter currently resides in St. Louis with his wife Patricia, and children Brendan and India."

The effort saw a more stripped-down approach, as well as the addition of multi-instrumentalist Drew Glackin (the Silos) and Scott Yoder (Star City, Blue Chieftains, World Famous Blue Jays).

Edell has been a songwriter/composer for over two decades and toured the US between 1978 and 1983, performing her music. Her debut on the Michigan stage was in 1977, oddly enough the same year that she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Since that time, Edell has gone from being athletic, able bodied, and outspoken to being self assured, spiritual, and even more outspoken.

Though the band's first album was a success, Machine Head had a series of albums that earned the band criticism for ""selling out"".

[a=Dave McClain] left in 2018 after 24 years
[a=Phil Demmel] left in 2018 after 16 years

In 2019 Flynn announced a 25th anniversary tour of the band debut album ""Burn My Eyes"", where the band would play 2 sets with 2 tour line-ups; one performing the ""Burn My Eyes"" record in its entirety featuring former members [a=Logan Mader] and [a=Chris Kontos] joining him and Jared, and another set where the band would perform other MH songs, with Robb and Jared being joined by guitarist [a=Wacław Kiełtyka] (of [a=Decapitated]) and drummer [a=Matt Alston] (of [a=Sanctorum]).

Gustafson left before the recording of their first LP, Grimaldi was replaced by Jason Viebrooks, and the band went on to record two albums of groove-thrash metal in the early Machine Head vein with that line-up.
After the second album ""Nemesis"" was released in 1997, Viebrooks also left, and was replaced by Canadian bassist Stuart Carruthers for the recording of their third album ""Solidify"" (1999), before more or less naturally dissolving since the members were involved in other activities.

At this point, Lombardo is concentrating on the Fantomas project, and Sorychta has been busy producing bands like Tiamat, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering. 

The band never really disappeared though, and in 2004 they released a new album called ""Incorporated"" with Sorychta filling in on bass duties.

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

Not to be confused with Angel Dust (later Asmodina) from Darmstadt who released a demo in 1985.

1891281,0,2370932,US,Delusive Dream,Lethargy,1999,33.72,6,['Album'],['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"US Power/Speed metal band from Medina, Ohio.

In 1994, an unlikely meeting between Darrell Patrick and Kenny Easterly sowed the seeds of Delusive Dream. Their following meetings would see the two jamming and not long after, writing original music, which they continued to do over the next few years.
In 1997, the band included Patrick Ols as bassist/vocalist. Soon they released a 6 song EP entitled Lethargy. Delusive Dream gathers a buzz around its name within Northeast Ohio and elsewhere, as they continue to play local clubs and clubs out of state. By word of mouth and with a little help from the web, they would come to find that they were developing a fan base not only in the states, but abroad.

In 2001, second guitarist Bo Mroczkowski was added to the line-up. The band had slowed down over the months prior to his joining and they were now eager to play more live shows as well as do more practicing and writing. However, Ols had grown disillusioned with the lack of response from the music scene to push Delusive Dream out of an opening slot band to a constant headliner. As a result, Pat had started playing second guitar with the band Gatlin and communication between Ols and Delusive Dream became increasingly difficult.

Eventually, Ols and Delusive Dream parted ways. The split came as a relief to both parties as they were now able to focus exclusively on their respective paths. The band was having difficulty finding replacements for the bass and vocal voids and went through several line-up changes within a short period of time.

In 2002, the band asked friend and bassist Hank Leibold to fill the bass spot. Delusive Dream, having played shows with Hank before, were confident they had found the bass player they needed. Hank passed away in 2014."

Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly swords and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that ""these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that."" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan ""Death to false metal"".

Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as ""Metal Warriors"", ""Manowarriors"", ""Immortals"" or ""Brothers of Metal"".

""I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?"" - Joey DeMaio, during a 2006 interview with Rock Hard Magazine.

Fighting The World (the band's fifth release) was metal's first full-digital recording

The creation of Gods Of War was not devoid of obstacles. The band was forced to delay its release when, deep into the recording sessions, Logan suffered a devastating injuring after crashing on his prized dirtbike. Logan dislocated his elbow in the accident, an injury so severe it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career. But the guitarist fought back and after months of painful rehabilitation, he boasted he has never played his instrument better. 

During Manowar's career, the band have recorded 10 studio albums; two live albums; five DVDs and countless compilations.

Manowar's many innovations include:
* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers
* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles
* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra
* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and their own guitars as well
* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions)

Manowar created Magic Circle Music.

The band formed by Ralf Scheepers and members of Sinner (Ger) after he left Gamma Ray to (unsuccesfully) audition for Judas Priest. Ralf previously filled in for Helloween on tour in 1986 when Kai Hansen had difficulty continuing as both guitarist and vocalist. After the tour he knocked back the offer of the job full-time (it would of course then go to Michael Kiske).

Primal Fear split with Nuclear Blast in 2006 after Mat Sinner left his job as a label rep with the company in January.

Henny Wolter rejoined Primal Fear in 2007, replacing Tom Naumann for the second time. Naumann's departure has not been clarified. The band's other longtime guitarist, Stefan Leibing, departed in February 2008 to spend more time with his family.

Coal Chamber are led by gruff vocalist Dez Fafara and operate in territory somewhere between the traditional hard riffing of Black Sabbath and the sensationalist techno rock of Marilyn Manson. Fafara met guitarist Miguel ""Meegs' Rascon through a classified ad, and they later added drummer Mike Cox and bass player Rayna Foss, the room-mate of Fafara's future wife.

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002. The band was further unsettled when Cox departed the same September. Coal Chamber split in 2003.

In late 2011 it was announced that Coal Chamber would be reformed."

Formed in 1989 by four co-workers at the Rosenlund hospital, Clawfinger comprised of Jocke Skog (b. 3 June 1969, Stockholm, Sweden; programming, vocals), Zak Tell (b. 16 November 1970, Stockholm, Sweden; vocals), Erlend Ottem (b. 13 December 1968, Molde, Norway; guitar) and Bård Torstensen (b. 13 September 1961, Arendal, Norway; guitar). They immediately received international praise for their fluid but powerful alternative rock sound. Their debut single, 1993's ""Nigger"", also provoked great controversy. Although the subject matter was profoundly anti-racist, many critics wondered as to the wisdom of its title. The media quickly categorized Clawfinger alongside American outfits such as Rage Against The Machine, who similarly combined political activism with a musical scope that ranged from hardcore rap to metal. The band's debut album, Deaf Dumb Blind, expanded their repertoire to encompass funk and even jazz flourishes. It was promoted in the USA on tours with Anthrax and Alice In Chains, while Clawfinger remained rooted in their national charts with a joint EP with Swedish rappers Just D. In 1995 the band, now expanded to a six-piece with the addition of André Skaug (b. Sunndalsøra, Norway; bass) and Ottar Vigerstøl (drums), launched their ""Back To The Basics"" European tour, which saw them play in 12 European countries within a few weeks.

The band took a break before starting work on their self-titled third album, which featured session drummer Henka Johansson (b. Karlskoga, Sweden). Johansson was later added to the line-up as the band embarked on an extensive tour. Their fourth album, A Whole Lot Of Nothing, was released in 2001 followed by Zeros & Heroes in 2003.

Danzig morphed out of the goth punk band Samhain after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin. Rubin was interested in working with Glenn, but not with Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group. Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von and guitarist John Christ and for drums Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. The original line-up recorded band’s first four albums, but during the mid-90’s the group started to disintegrate with first Chuck Biscuits leaving the group and soon after John Christ and Eerie Von followed. At the time Glenn also came at odds with producer Rubin and his label and the two ended collaborations as well.

Following the line-up turmoil Glenn took distance from the blues driven heavy metal that Danzig had become known for and introduced strong industrial sound on “Danzig 5: Blackaciddevil”, a move that was not received well by fans or critics. After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band returned to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, but have not managed to recapture the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records had.

Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver ""Ollie"" Riedel, drummer Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz.

Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] (""Dance Metal"").

There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] (""Rammstein Air Show"") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Since forming the band in 1995, he's performed with most every major artist in the Country and Americana music community. Stuart was personally given permission to use the band's name by Johnny Cash himself.

He was also honored by the Man in Black with an invitation to record songs at Cash's own home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Two other iconic music legends, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, were also early believers who were instrumental in helping Stuart get his start.

With the release of their critically acclaimed debut CD""Walk Alone"" in 1999, the Bastard Sons quickly proved they were no novelty act. With strong songwriting and great musicianship, the Sons' quickly jumped to the forefront of the growing Alternative Country Scene. No stranger to the road, their constant touring and hard work have built the band a loyal grass roots following both in the States and abroad.

Whether performing in front of thousands at a Festival in the US or Europe, or playing all night in a Texas dance hall, for Stuart it’s all about respect. ""The Bastard Sons never were, and never will be, a Johnny Cash tribute band.""  It's always been about honoring the musical ideals of our heroes, and paying respect to the originality, integrity, and independence that made those artists who they are. Our goal was always to find our own road, and to continue to keep the sounds and traditions of American Roots Music alive.

Stuart and the Bastard Sons have released 5 outstanding CD’s: Walk Alone, Distance Between, Mile Markers, Bend in the Road, and their latest New Old Story. Their music has been featured in Film, Television, and compilation CD's around the world."

Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends [a=Gram Parsons] and [a=Chris Hillman] (both former members of [a=The Byrds]), the group underwent many personnel changes. 

The original group featured Parsons and Hillman as primary vocalists, guitarists and composers with [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow] (pedal steel guitar), [a=Chris Ethridge] (bass) and a rotating series of drummers. [a=Michael Clarke] (also a former member of The Byrds) was eventually added as permanent drummer, while Ethridge was replaced by guitarist [a=Bernie Leadon] after Hillman switched to bass following the first album.

Following the second album Burrito Deluxe, Gram Parsons was succeeded as frontman by [a=Rick Roberts] for one studio album and a live album. The group then splintered; Chris Hillman and [a=Al Perkins] (Kleinow's replacement) joined [a=Manassas], Bernie Leadon founded [a=Eagles], and later additions [a=Byron Berline], [a=Roger Bush] and [a=Kenny Wertz] formed [a=Country Gazette]. Following a 1973 European tour with new members, Rick Roberts dissolved the band and began a solo career, before forming [a=Firefall] with Michael Clarke. 

After original members Kleinow and Ethridge reformed the band in the mid-1970s with new players (including more former members of The Byrds, [a=Gene Parsons] and [a=Skip Battin]), a more Nashville-centered incarnation of the band led by [a=Gib Guilbeau] and [a=John Beland] eventually emerged, recording & touring through the 1980s as [a=Burrito Brothers].

Pete Kleinow began using the Flying Burritos Bros name again in the mid 1980s, eventually being joined by Gib and John.  Through numerous incarnations (nearly all with Beland at the helm), the band released albums and toured throughout the 1980s and '90s. The latter day Flying Burrito Brothers CDs, produced by Beland, did feature an impressive line-up of guests, including [a=Merle Haggard], [a=Buck Owens], [a=Waylon Jennings], [a=Alison Krauss], [a=Ricky Skaggs], [a=Charles Louvin], and others. The band's final two CDs, [m=1168733] and [r=5398239] received solid critical reviews, but Beland called it quits for the band in 2000, finally ending the band. He embarked upon a successful career as a record producer, The trademark for Flying Burrito Brothers' name was acquired by Chris Hillman in the 2010s.

Kleinow's 2000s spin-off band [a=Burrito Deluxe] featured [a=Carlton Moody (2)] on lead vocals and [a=Garth Hudson] from [a=The Band] on keyboards. The band scored no chart success, relying solely on live appearances in Europe. Kleinow left the band due to illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to any of the actual Flying Burrito Brothers members, past or present, although the band carried on until 2010 when it became [a=The Burritos], and then in 2014 [a=The Burrito Brothers]. A band calling itself The Burrito Brothers continues to tour and release music.

Starting her journey in the music industry at a young age with a 1965 single released as Jamie Carter. She then met Shadow Morton who helped her pitch songs she wrote to the Shangri-Las (I'll Never Learn) and Vanilla Fudge (The Spell That Comes After).

In 1969 she was discovered singing in a New York club by Mo Ostin, who signed her for Reprise. That same year she recorded her debut ablum as Essra Mowhawk, released by Reprise in May 1970. Primordial Lovers received a lot of praise.

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

Known as ""Van the Man"" by his fans, Morrison started his musical career as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, penning their seminal 1964 hit ""Gloria"". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career. (In 1966 he moved to the USA, first to New York City. In 1968 he lived 9 months in Cambridge near Boston. Early Autumn 1968, he recorded Astral Weeks in New York, then moving to Woodstock. In the spring of 1971 he moved to California, settling in the leafy Marin County town of Fairfax, where he built his own Caledonia Studios. Morrison has moved house a lot. By 1977 he's living in Brentwood near Los Angeles, later it's Sausalito, ... Morrison would revisit Ireland and the UK, e.g. buying a house in Bath, England.)

Van Morrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2000, Morrison ranked #25 on American cable music channel VH1's list of its 100 greatest artists of rock and roll, and in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Van Morrison 42nd on their list of The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for ""The Soho Project"" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just ""Clague""), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): ""Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.""

In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing ""I Want My Crown"" and ""House on the Hill"" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as ""an evocation of the Kray Twins"". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. ""I didn't like the leather trousers!"" was Coynes' alleged reason.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played ""Eastbourne Ladies"" on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his ""Having a Party"", a scathing attack on Richard Branson.

Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single ""Marlene"" (b/w ""Everybody Says""), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Described as being musically ""... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge"", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent ""Eastbourne Ladies"" and the plaintive ""House on the Hill"" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock.

Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

""Babble"" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had ""changed my life"" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as ""One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda"". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet.

Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich being particularly well reviewed and attended. The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle – with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the ""Paradise Band"". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006).

The name is a contradiction in terms, “Violent” being self-explanatory and “Femmes” being Milwaukee slang for wimp.
The rhythm section added high school singer/songwriter Gordon Gano in 1981. Gano and Ritchie had previously performed together at Gano’s National Honor Society induction ceremony, where they caused a near riot. Gano was expelled from the Society and suspended from high school for this outrage. 
One of the only stable aspects of the band is their aversion to rehearsal. Due to this they would take the music to the streets in an attempt to hone it and earn some spare change. It was on one of these occasions that they were spotted by the Pretenders. Chrissie Hynde and the gang were so amused by the Violent Femmes antics that they invited the band to open the show for them. The hometown Milwaukee audience received the Femmes with unanimous booing. However by the end of the set the Femmes had converted approximately 50% of the audience to their cause. Many years later Brian Ritchie encountered Hynde when the Femmes and Pretenders shared the bill at a radio concert. She said, “Oh, you’re still around.”
The Femmes borrowed $10,000 from Victor De Lorenzo’s dad to record their legendary first album in 1982. Slash Records in Los Angeles was the only label to offer them a deal with the amazing advance of $0. The band accepted the deal and started on the predictable round of world tours, recording, more world tours, nervous breakdowns, band members quitting, solo albums, regrouping, more touring, divorces, more crackups, dropped from record deals, new deals, more touring, record company going bankrupt, lawsuits, etc. etc. etc. ad infinitum. 
Fast forward to the present. Many things have changed. One thing that hasn’t is the sound of the band. Their loose, improvisational, acoustic sound is timeless.

Born: 27 November 1942, Seattle, USA – Died: 18 September 1970, London, UK.

A  self-taught guitarist, Hendrix began his musical career backing such R&B greats as Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and B.B. King. Brought to London from New York by former Animals bassist [a=Chas Chandler], Hendrix quickly established himself as the brightest new star on the burgeoning progressive rock scene of the early '60s. Along with bassist [a=Noel Redding] and drummer [a=Mitch Mitchell] he formed [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/255672-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-The]The Jimi Hendrix Experience[/url].

After a landmark appearance at the Monterey Pop festival, their debut album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Are-You-Experienced/master/24497]Are You Experienced[/url] was released in September 1967. The album, and its 1968 successors - [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Axis-Bold-As-Love/master/24511]Axis: Bold As Love[/url] and the seminal blues-oriented developments of [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Electric-Ladyland/master/24535]Electric Ladyland[/url] - earned Hendrix international acclaim as a premier rock instrumentalist and innovator of his generation. A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

Died: 04 October 1970, Los Angeles, California, USA.

[b]Joplin[/b] was the eldest of her siblings [a3565868] and [a3565870], and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where she began painting and listening to blues artists [a=Bessie Smith], [a=Leadbelly], [a=Big Mama Thornton] and [a=Odetta] with the other rebellious kids in her neighborhood. She graduated high school in 1960, and in 1962, she quit university in the middle of her studies. The university then ran the headline, ""She Dares To Be Different"" in the student newspaper.

She went to San Francisco in 1963, first living in North Beach and later, Haight-Ashbury, where she begun the drug and alcohol habits that would tragically end her life. During this period, she recorded a session with [a=Jorma Kaukonen] that later appeared as the bootleg ""The Typewriter Tape"". Noticeably suffering from her addictions, she returned to Port Arthur in May 1965 and 'straightened up' for a year, enrolling as a sociology major at Lamar University.

In 1966, at the invitation of [a=Chet Helms] whom she'd known as a teenager, she returned to California and was recruited as the singer for [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] in June, appearing at the [l=Avalon Ballroom] in San Francisco during her first public performance with them. In August 1966, the group signed with [l=Mainstream Records] and recorded an album. However, it was not released until a year later and in the meantime, with very little reward, they moved with the [a=Grateful Dead] to a house in Lagunitas, California. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drug use.

Joplin and the band signed with [a=Albert Grossman] in November 1967 and released [r559560] in 1968. This release was the culmination of a year in which Joplin had wowed audiences at the Monterey Pop Festival, the Anderson Theater in New York, the Wake For Martin Luther King Jr concert with [a=Jimi Hendrix] in New York and on TV's prime-time Dick Cavett Show. Joplin then left the band after a Family Dog benefit gig in December 1968 and formed a back-up group, the [a=Kozmic Blues Band], releasing an album in September 1969. The group disbanded three months later, with Joplin again suffering from her addictions.

After taking time out in Brazil with close friend Linda Gravenites (wife of Bay Area musician [a=Nick Gravenites] from 1962-1970), who was her costume designer and praised by Joplin in the May 1968 issue of Vogue, Joplin returned to America and formed the [a=Full Tilt Boogie Band], which began touring in May 1970. She also appeared in reunion concerts with [a=Big Brother & The Holding Company] at this time. She then began recording a new album in September 1970 with producer [a=Paul A. Rothchild].

By Saturday, October 3rd Joplin had already laid down a number of takes at [l=Sunset Recording Studios] in LA, including ""Mercedes Benz"". On the following day she failed to appear and John Cooke, the road manager of Full Tilt Boogie Band, drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel where Joplin was staying. There he found her dead on the floor of her room, the result of a seizure caused by a heroin overdose.

Joplin was cremated and her ashes scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean. Her unfinished recordings were assembled and the result was the posthumously released [r755239] in 1971. It became the biggest selling album of her career.

After his sophomore album ‘If It Sings Like You Do’ in 2001, North began to employ the help of other musicians, mostly for live performances.  His album output remained primarily himself recording as a multi-instrumentalist, though accompanying performers started to became more frequent after 2003’s ‘Background Music For Foreground Times’. 

In 2004 Eric North released both ‘The Nidus’ and ‘Dive’ - with the former initially released without the Hideous North moniker.  Later versions of it were released as The Hideous North. 

2005’s ‘Your Mother Called & Said She Doesn’t Love You’ marked the last album of new material from The Hideous North, though the band remained intermittently active through about 2012.  A retrospective compilation album of re-recorded selections from The Hideous North’s prior discography [‘Recollected | 1999 - 2005’] was officially released in 2017, after a four year hiatus.  

In 2020 The Hideous North (rather silently) reissued its entire five album discography individually as “2020 Definitive Archive Editions”, wherein each album’s tracklist was reformatted, restored, reduced and/or expanded to include every track that was initially intended for the album in its original conception.  With that intent, these CD editions contain a significant amount of previously unreleased material, remastered and re-recorded tracks (many of the same versions that previously appeared on ‘Recollected’), and extended auto-biographical liner notes. 

As of 2022, The Hideous North remains disbanded, with no announced plans to release new material.

His teachers included [a255302] and [a203972] at Simon Fraser University and [a266173], Casey Sokol, Richard Teitelbaum, and [a179366] at York University.

Oswald first came to notice as a habitué in the mid-1970s of the [l134019], where his affiliations included Pitch (established in 1976 with Marvin Green and responsible for a variety of events held in total darkness), the Glass Orchestra, the New Music Co-op and, as founder and sometime editor, [l31186].

Oswald has performed throughout Canada and in the USA as an alto saxophonist, playing in both solo and group improvisational settings. Oswald, whose style is free of jazz references and often fiercely expressive, also has appeared on other albums by Kaiser, as well as recordings by Alfred Harth and M+M.

In dance, he has prepared scores (mostly tape) for Dancemakers, Tangente, Toronto Independent Dance Enterprise, and Bill Coleman's North American Experience (the full-length ballets Shane, 1987; Baryshnikov, 1987; Zorro, 1989), and for several choreographers - eg, Jennifer Mascall (Parade, 1986; Elle, 1989), Paula Ravitz and Denise Fujiwara (Skindling Shades,1987; renamed Spontaneous Combustion) and Fujiwara alone (Loud Colors, 1990), Holly Small (Wounded, 1988, Small Attack, 1990), Bill Douglas (Anima, 1990), and James Kudelka (Case of Death, 1991). He has participated as an accompanist and/or dancer in performances.by Fujiwara, Small, Danceworks, the North American Experience, and others.

In 1980 Oswald established the [a179362], preparing and distributing music/sound collages on cassettes packaged with neither sources noted nor explanations given. In 1987 he reversed the principle with the EP [r1815470], which comprised four 'revised performances' created by the 'plundering' (i.e., studio manipulation, including 'sampling' and subsequent reconstruction) of recordings by Count Basie, Dolly Parton, and Elvis Presley, and of The Rite of Spring. A CD of [r231483] followed in 1989, with an additional 20 plundered performances by the Beatles, Glenn Gould (from the Goldberg Variations), Michael Jackson, et al, and of Liszt, Webern, Verdi, and Beethoven. Although Oswald's sources were scrupulously acknowedged and the recordings given free of charge to musicians, critics, libraries, etc., the CD nevertheless was deemed to be in violation of Canadian copyright laws. Under the threat of legal action Oswald relinquished the master tapes and all undistributed copies to CRIA which in 1990 had them destroyed. Ironically, Oswald was subsequently commissioned by the US label Elektra to plunder its catalogue and prepared the CD Rubáiyát Plunderphonics (Elektra PRCD-8247, issued in 1991) to mark the company's 40th anniversary.

Oswald has received other commissions from [a908098] (Slide Whistles, 1976; Acupuncture, 1991) and the Kronos Quartet, and has prepared scores for the RectoVerso theatre company of Matane, Que. His first piece for the Kronos, Spectre (1990), is in the composer's words 'for gesturing string quartet and the recorded allusion of a 1001 string orchestra'. A second work for Kronos, premiered in part in 1991, involved the plundering of the Beethoven quartets."

VDO mach 1 featured a large ensemble of musicians centered around Castille and was responsible for the material issued on the first two cassette releases.

The following two VDO tape releases were the solo work of Castille, albeit heavily influenced by the mutant musical marginalia of Lumbleau.

He was born in 1954 in Topeka, Kansas but raised in Kansas City, Missouri, USA.

Nigro began with the typically teenage pursuit of fronting his own high school band, Norwegian Wood, and several other short-lived combos followed.  His first recording was a 7-Inch acetate for [l=Damon (3)] in Kansas City, limited to five copies, with the songs ""Journey to Find Who We Are"" and ""To You"".  Next, via an ad in a Kansas City newspaper, he happened upon the opportunity of studio work at age 20.  During the next few years at the subterranean [l=Liberty Recording Studios (2)] - where [r1658872] was recorded in 1976—and [l=Big K Records] (where it was mixed in 1977) he worked steadily, recording as a labor of economy during studio off-hours when he was given free reign.   The eponymous titled debut LP [r1658872] was released on the [l=Big K Records (3)] subsidiary [l=Guinn Records] in 1977.    It quickly disappeared into obscurity.  Years later, record collectors began finding copies of the album and it began appearing on collector's want lists.   Since its discovery by fringe-searchers it has been christened a heavy-hitter in the pantheon of “out-of-time” treasures.  Self-produced and nearly fully self-created, Michael Angelo is a staggering, hook-filled, inner space hi-fi snapshot of dreamy folk-rock, Anglophile-pop and light psychedelia, filled with contemplative, arresting lyrical imagery and carries little to ally it to its time (spare some shimmering keyboards).  It has been reissued four time since the late 1990s, including most recently by [l=Anthology Recordings] in 2015.  

In the early 1990s he formed a band [a=Synifus] with Kansas City musicians [a=Rusty Crewse] and [a=Paul Allee] and released the album [r10565626] on cassette tape in 1991 and [r10565715] in 1994.  1999 saw [l=Void Records (3)] release an album of unreleased material from the same [r1658872] 1976 recording sessions and [l=Mexican Summer] made available two of the tracks on the [r2473472] 7-Inch Single in 2010.  2016 saw the reforming of the band [a=Synifus] with longtime friends Crewse and Allee, this time calling themselves [a=Michael Angelo's Dreamfeast] from the song ""Dreamfeast"" by Synifus.  The band made appearances at the music festivals Montreal Pop and Outer Reaches, performing tracks from the 1977 self-titled album live for the first time ever.

Died: 13th February 2010.
Pioneer American rock singer, songwriter, producer and rhythm guitarist who was often called the architect of swamp rock boogie. Fellow rockabilly pioneer [a478866] was his cousin.

In 1957, Hawkins was playing at Shreveport, Louisiana clubs, and although his music was influenced by the new rock and roll style of Elvis Presley and the guitar sounds of Scotty Moore, Hawkins blended that with the uniquely heavy blues sound of black Louisiana artists for his recording of his swamp-rock classic, ""Susie Q."" Fellow Louisiana guitarist and future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer James Burton provided the signature riff and solo. The song was chosen as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Creedence Clearwater Revival's version of the song on their 1968 debut album helped launch their career and today it is probably the best known version.

Hawkins went on to a long and successful career, recording a number of songs for Chess Records. In 1998, Ace Records issued a compilation album, Dale Hawkins, Rock 'n' Roll Tornado, which contained a collection of his early works and previously unreleased material. Other recordings include the cult classic ""LA, Memphis and Tyler, Texas,"" and a 1999 release, ""Wildcat Tamer,"" of all-new recordings that garnered Hawkins a 4-star review in Rolling Stone. However, his career was not limited to recording or performing. He hosted a teen dance party, The Dale Hawkins Show, on WCAU-TV in Philadelphia.

He then became a record producer, and found success with The Uniques' ""Not Too Long Ago,"" the Five Americans' ""Western Union,"" Jon & Robin's ""Do It Again – A Little Bit Slower."" He served as executive vice president of Abnak Records; Vice President, Southwest Division, Bell Records (here he produced Bruce Channel, Ronnie Self, James Bell, the Festivals, the Dolls, and the Gentrys); and A&R director, RCA West Coast Rock Division, working with Michael Nesmith and Harry Nilsson. In the 1990s, he produced ""Goin Back to Mississippi"" by R. L. Burnside's slide guitarist, Kenny Brown.

Hawkins' pioneering contributions have been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame."

That sound was bagpipes mixed with electric guitar. The music, the energy and the humor coming from the group quickly propelled them to the national stage.  Thanks to the impeccable bagpiping of Iain MacHarg and the vocal/guitar work of Aron Garceau the boys have become staples of the Highland Games circuit as well as headliners at Celtic music festivals across the nation.  Traditional highland bagpiping mixed with modern rock flavor, tunes that flow effortlessly between time signatures and feel, Prydein is an experience to see live. “You are each fine musicians, but something magical happens when you play together. You are true Celtic Rock” (Jo Sarnelli, Westfield on Weekends).

With Andy Smith on bass and Caleb Bronz on drums Prydein bridges the generation gap with their music, enough cutting edge rock and angst mixed with traditional and original tunes played on the highland bagpipes in such a way that even the traddies would like.  Prydein has shared the stage with such noted performers as The Tannahil Weavers, Enter the Haggis, Rathkeltair, Seven Nations, the Young Dubliners, the Red Hot Chili Pipers and Albannach.  They have closed out the annual New York Tartan Day Parade ceremonies in New York City and have been featured on television and radio.  While this may not be your great-grandfather’s Celtic band, Prydein is your Celtic rock band."
