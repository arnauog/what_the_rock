Their songs swagger and radiate like elegantly wasted Hollywood stars from the 50s.  Their guitar riffs are fuzzy and irresistible and their grooves are vintage and deeply infectious, and their vocal melodies soar and make you swoon like the price of petrol.   If Morricone, Amy Winehouse and Jack White were forced to write songs in a small tent, this is how it might sound.

Wayne Jackson’s first band The Dostoyevskys achieved cult status in the mid 90s after delighting live audiences all across Europe with their enigmatic live shows, before he split the band and released two albums as a solo artist.  He also co-wrote and sang “The Other Side” with Paul Van Dyk which was a hit across the globe. In between he found time to co-produce both Bela B. solo albums and played in his live band. 

Lula also wrote songs for Germany’s most famous drummer, and sang several duets with Bela too. Recently she has added photography and TV presenting to her lengthy list of accomplishments. 

Since their birth as a band in the summer of 2012, The Dead Lovers have accomplished a great deal in a very short time  They provided title songs for two TV shows for RTL and ZDF Kultur, a further title song for a major German cinema film in which they also appeared.  And last year they recorded their debut album in the amazing Lost Ark Studio in San Diego. The album is now mixed and mastered and will be released this Summer.

Last year, the celebrated Luxembourg actor and martial artist Mickey Hardt joined the band as a musical all rounder, adding his stunning vocal harmonies to the tapestry.  His first appearance was at the TDL show at the Lott Festival where he played bass, but since then he’s moved over to guitars and Vox Continental organ.  Mickey has been Wayne’s trainer and close friend for the last 9 years.  Chris Lippert and Oscar Alpen provide effortlessly stylish bass and drums and complete the line-up."

Hailing from all corners of the US, lead singer Phil Weiner, drummer, Anthony Lopez, guitarists, Ashton Likes and Michael Pozzi, along with bassist Ryan Driscoll, The Absolute is releasing their first full length album Grow (2014) with San Diego based Randm Records. Produced by Mike Butler, Grow centers around how the band were changing as individuals while also commenting on broader issues and the world around them.

Starting with the folk inspired opening track From This Day Forward to the heavier rock anthems of Seek and You’ll Find and Like I Do, The Absolute is issuing a call to arms. “We’re not telling you what to think”, says Anthony, “We just hope that you will think. So many of the issues surrounding us today have a tendency to be simplified into these very polarizing viewpoints. It’s a lot of black and white and everyone has their own agenda. Hopefully our audience isn’t going to just jump on the band wagon…hopefully they’ll look a little deeper and be moved to find their own voice.” But it’s not all social commentary on Grow. Weiner contemplates failed relationships in the infectiously catchy Smile and Bite Your Tongue while also turning more introspective, reflecting on one’s own failures and legacy on the hauntingly beautiful tracks No Wonder and Grow.

In between sessions at the Lost Ark Studio, the band has been performing frequently at renowned LA rock clubs - Hotel Cafe, Silverlake Lounge, The Satellite and Bootleg Bar among others. But the Absolute’s concert is more than a performance. “What we try to encourage through our live show is an open, creative environment,” Phil says, “A platform to expand your mind. We’re here to challenge you: the absolute art, the absolute love, the absolute life; do everything all the way… and Grow.”"

Their appeal crosses so many borders and with their self penned songs about teenage life today, they are turning the world's kids onto a wild Rock 'n' Roll beat.

Even from their early days playing in youth clubs around Liverpool, they caused a big stir! Their first single, the ASBO shuffle became an anthem at Liverpool football club, their debut album reached number 10 in the UK vinyl charts (above Elton John & Thin Lizzy) and more recently, their music has been featured on the computer game 'Rock Band' as well as a Dolce & Gabanna ad campaign in the USA.

They have played countless gigs abroad, all over the world touring with the likes of Glen Matlock of The Sex Pistols, Slim Jim Phantom, UB40 and they've even had a beer named after them! This is the real roots of Rock 'n' Roll, so prepare yourself, Furious ain't for the faint hearted! - MOJO Magazine."

Two areas that differ are sound quality and set length. Mark Benson who portrays John Lennon in the band, says the original Beatles live performances in the 1960s, the fans were lucky to hear the music. You have to credit The Beatles with revolutionising the sound reinforcement industry, says Benson. Back then they had these little speakers that you couldn't hear anything out of. The way concerts were Amplified had to be changed. Benson says fans who saw the original shows notice the difference. People will come to us and say, I saw the Beatles in 64 and the only difference is I can hear you, Benson says.

Another difference is set length. The Beatles did to 30 minutes at sin there early shows and never did on course, while 1964 the tribute performs to 45 minute sets. We tried the half-hour show initially but it didn't go over well, says Benson.

The members of the group decided which member would portray which Beatle based on the instrument he played. I was a guitarist, so the natural thing was the John or the George character, says Tom work, who portrays George Harrison. The way I got into this was, the fellow playing John Lennon, join the band that was a local Beatles tribute at. This was around 1981. After about a year, he got his buddy Gary Grimes to join and play Paul, and I was friends with him. About a year later, he got me to join and play George. Over the years, the lineup has included;

The band's mission is to accurately recreate the 1964 Beatles invasion of America. Members play a set of early Beatles music, with some middle Beatles thrown in. Sometimes the group's costumes reflect the Beatles early period, and sometimes members wear replicas of the Shea Stadium concert apparel from 1965. The concept is performing a show that gives you an idea of what it was like to see The Beatles when they were touring, says Benson. It's definitely a music gig, but there's an acting element to it says Work. None of us is really an actor per se. I probably come closes because I've done some plays, just in Community Theatre. But there's some acting. You need to adopt the body language, the speaking voice. Those two things, I guess, for this kind of role are two aspects that resemble acting. Everything else is more musicianship and vocal impersonation singing I mean. The group separates is life on stage from off stage. We didn't want to be them, just wanted to portray them says Work. No one really considered wearing those boots around all the time or the tight pants for having hair that look like that. We were musicians before, professional, full-time musicians. We didn't start doing Beatles until we were 30. The members are getting older, but are doing better than ever.

1964 the tribute, originally called 1964 as the Beatles is a Beatles tribute band that was formed in 1984.
The origin is in the United States and they are active to the present day. The group plans to continue performing. Asked about their future, Tom work, who portrays George Harrison said , ""the answer to that is the answer Gary gave his dad. His dad asked him how long are you going to do this? And Gary Grimes who played Paul McCartney until his death in 2010 said, until they stop coming. We are not anywhere close to the age The Beatles were. I'm sure many people will comment, they're starting to look a little old to be doing this, but people are still coming. Just being a musician keeps you young at heart."

It’s quite a statement, but these fab skinny tie sportin’ boys can prove them selves, and the proof is in the music… all hits! Three minute modern beat anthems presented to you on a platter of pop perfection. Just listen to THE CONNECTION and try not to dance, smile and have an absolutely far out time. You see the magic is in the grooves. In no time at all, you will be getting hip to what these boys deliver – straight up hits, baby. I should know, having seen the group arise from its inception out of drunken smoke filled nights, listening to HARD DAYS NIGHT and Rockpile’s SECONDS OF PLEASURE. THE CONNECTION wear their influences on their sleeves – and those sleeves have been pleated and dry cleaned for optimum pop potential.

So we keep hearing that they are all the rage, but who are these chaps? And furthermore do they really have what it takes to call themselves HITMAKERS? Well, of course they do and I’ll tell you why! Take singer BRAD MARINO, his calm and cool vocal delivery has a way of swooning all the hip girls into a frenzy of Beatle Mania hysterics, and GEOFF PALMER with his twangin’ 6 string cuts through like a knife into the delicious rock n’ roll pie. Rounding out this chic squad is ANDY CASEY laying down the rhythm with his groovin’ bass, keeping tight order with every foot stomp of his Cuban Heels and CHRIS FAULKNER hittin’ the skins with precision. There is no doubt when these four get into a room, the music that they make can be considered nothing more than the best. Live and in person – the hits become even more apparent. Don’t miss these boys when they come rollin’ through town… I’m talking about an instant shindig… a real mixer!

And now that you know about THE CONNECTION let’s bring it back to where it really counts. I’m talking about you, the listener. As you hold this record in your hands, think about quality, think about fun… think about pop HITS. And luckily for you, it’s all here in one place, eagerly awaiting a special home on your turntable. Ladies and Gentleman, I present to you THE CONNECTION – “NEW ENGLANDS NEWEST HITMAKERS”. Dig it, you won’t be sorry. -- (

Kurt Baker Feb. 2012 Nashville, TN )"

Original line up was Gary X-Ray (vocals), Lee Love (Bass), Fast Jimmy (Guitar) and Skintight Tim (drums). Initially formed just for excuses to hang about and get pissed, the band's hastily recorded initial demo of six songs was snapped up by Sweden's esteemed Bootleg Booze record label - forcing the band to continue. 
Jimmy/James left the band in 2009 claiming that the band partying and drug intake had become more important than their musical endeavours. By this time, new guitarist, [a2670430]  had taken predominant guitar. [a3234307] left the band in 2010 following a fatal midlife crisis and, although the band considered jacking it in, the recruitment of local panda-eyed kickboxing champion, [a2665501], instantly injected the band with a new lease of life - despite being banned from glamorous Grimsby at their first gig with the new line up after altercations with Hell's Angels and 'exotic dancers' in attendance. 
Drummer, Skintight Tim then left in August 2015 and was replaced bye 'the kid', [a4886542] In October 2017 Joe then left and was replaced by the new drummer  [a7032201]  At the same time, the band decided to recruit a rhythm guitarist and took on Canadian, [a7032202]. The band then parted ways with Mike in December 2018 and then located the local wunderkid guitarist, [a10121260].

They released their 4th album 'Stand For Nothing' on March 11th 2019 and toured extensively. In 2023 they signed to Swedish Label The Sign (who actually turned out to be piss poor) and completed what turned out to be their final album 'Roden House Blues' - this was released in 2023. 

As of November 2024, the band have now put out 5 studio albums, a double singles compilation, a single singles compilation, one 12"" EP and now one final 10"" and around 31 singles of genius anthemic Garage / Post Scandi / Action Proto Punk / Rock 'n' Roll (or whatever you wanna call it). 

Despite their best efforts and hard work - they continued to be largely ignored by what's left of the mainstream 'music business' (if that's still a thing) and continued to revel in their UK scene pariah status. The singles pretty much sold-out in little time at all and they amassed a hardcore fanbase of loons, misfits, many of which now form their 'fan club', The Spasm Gang. 
The UK and world at large doesn't give a fuck but neither, in the main, do they. 

In 2024 they announced that they were bored of casting endless pearls before swine and were to split in November 2024 (after 18 years). 
They released a final 10"" EP 'We Become Nothing' in October 2024. The UK will not see their like again. "

The trio consists of [a5480971], [a5480968], and [a5480972]. Lawrence plays and sings with a mix of the sensitivity of artists such as [a224992] or [a243300], with the visceral aggressiveness of the Raw Power-era Stooges. Tineo matches Lawrence's style, playing drums with a style that often leaves hands bloodied and drum heads dismembered. And bassist Manzanares the quiet one of the group, leaves people in awe over the authority he demonstrates over his instrument, all the while wondering whether he's a boy or a girl."

The band’s third original member, guitarist Zhenya Kolykhanov (he later legally changed his last name to “Rock”), had also emigrated to America and had been spending time playing in Texas. For the first few months Andrey Baranov was the band’s drummer, but within that year, the first American in the band, drummer Avi Sills from Austin, Texas, was added to the lineup. The four of them got their start playing on Santa Monica’s famed 3rd Street Promenade but became so popular that they were eventually asked to leave. The reason? They drew such huge crowds that the shopkeepers complained it was interfering with business!"

Whalers has grown up in the five years since its formation, but the group hasn’t forgotten the infectious, boyish vitality that helped carry them out of the rehearsal space and onto some of Austin’s most reputable stages. From a collection of towns around Texas, the five men of Whalers rallied together in Austin in 2009 and have released two EPs and will release their first full-length album, Submarine Sun, in April 2014.

Though their recordings are packed with an untouchable energy, Whalers’ contagious vigor is best felt in their live performances. The group’s music is a striking blend of power-driven rock, complete with strong riffs from Dan Martin and Kyle Rother (guitars), and smooth, dreamy surf rock, reminiscent of bands like Real Estate and Wild Nothing. Gus Smalley (vocals) and Mitch Bertram (drums) stitch the two sounds together seamlessly, and bold lines from Amir Mozafari (bass) drive the band’s collection of songs forward with every beat.

Mingus Magazine said the band is “making music that flirts with disaster,” which is a statement that’s especially apparent on the boisterous track “Chrome Ocean” from their upcoming release, Submarine Sun. The album was recorded in Austin at Good Danny’s (White Denim, Okkervil River, Shearwater) and a South Austin studio space, and was mixed by Kevin Ratterman (My Morning Jacket) who also mixed the band’s first EP, 2010’s How The Ship Goes Down. On their first LP, Whalers has found the line that separates cool from calamity and perfected the art of skirting it. 

Whalers manages to stand out from the rest of the crowded Austin indie rock scene by blending genres and a range of influences that spans from The Yardbirds to The Strokes. With a base of energetic, captivating tracks in their repertoire, the future is bright for the Austin band."

It’s quite a statement, but these fab skinny tie sportin’ boys can prove them selves, and the proof is in the music… all hits! Three minute modern beat anthems presented to you on a platter of pop perfection. Just listen to THE CONNECTION and try not to dance, smile and have an absolutely far out time. You see the magic is in the grooves. In no time at all, you will be getting hip to what these boys deliver – straight up hits, baby. I should know, having seen the group arise from its inception out of drunken smoke filled nights, listening to HARD DAYS NIGHT and Rockpile’s SECONDS OF PLEASURE. THE CONNECTION wear their influences on their sleeves – and those sleeves have been pleated and dry cleaned for optimum pop potential.

So we keep hearing that they are all the rage, but who are these chaps? And furthermore do they really have what it takes to call themselves HITMAKERS? Well, of course they do and I’ll tell you why! Take singer BRAD MARINO, his calm and cool vocal delivery has a way of swooning all the hip girls into a frenzy of Beatle Mania hysterics, and GEOFF PALMER with his twangin’ 6 string cuts through like a knife into the delicious rock n’ roll pie. Rounding out this chic squad is ANDY CASEY laying down the rhythm with his groovin’ bass, keeping tight order with every foot stomp of his Cuban Heels and CHRIS FAULKNER hittin’ the skins with precision. There is no doubt when these four get into a room, the music that they make can be considered nothing more than the best. Live and in person – the hits become even more apparent. Don’t miss these boys when they come rollin’ through town… I’m talking about an instant shindig… a real mixer!

And now that you know about THE CONNECTION let’s bring it back to where it really counts. I’m talking about you, the listener. As you hold this record in your hands, think about quality, think about fun… think about pop HITS. And luckily for you, it’s all here in one place, eagerly awaiting a special home on your turntable. Ladies and Gentleman, I present to you THE CONNECTION – “NEW ENGLANDS NEWEST HITMAKERS”. Dig it, you won’t be sorry. -- (

Aloud is a four-piece rock n’ roll band fronted by songwriting team Henry Beguiristain and Jen de la Osa. The two have written songs together since their teens growing up in Miami, Florida. Beguiristain and de la Osa moved to Boston shortly after high school to form Aloud. Over the years, they have created a catalog of songs wide in range, but always influenced by the 60s soul and rock music they grew up on—with a particular affection for harmonies. While the two each have their own distinctive vocal style they are at their best singing together. The two married in 2010.

Aloud’s music has been featured on NPR’s Innovation Hub where it has the honor of being the show’s theme song, ESPN, FOX TV and just recently on a national TV spot for Ashley Furniture. The band has been written about in the Huffington Post, Elmore Magazine, Impose, the Boston Globe, and Time Out to name a few. They play regularly in the northeast, have done two national tours and have been invited several times to the CMJ and SXSW music festivals, and have shared the stage with acts such as Lady Lamb, Lake Street Dive, Cage the Elephant, Alpha Rev, and Hunter Valentine."

Like his brother, he was afflicted with albinism - he was legally blind, and had 20/400 eyesight in one eye and 20/600 in the other, but he made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues. He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

Her band flourished in the 80s but was struck by tragedy when four of the seven members were killed in the Hyatt Skywalk collapse in 1981. Once Teresa recovered she began teaching her grandchildren Mariachi music.

In 2000, Teresa and Maria began exploring other genres of music while simultaneously co-directing Mariachi Estrella. Today the fusion of Maria The Mexican is mixed with a touch of blues, soul, funk, and rock n' roll enhanced by the musical knowledge and sounds of Garrett Nordstrom.

Upon retiring, he felt that it was not right to live in a life of luxury, and he was helping in humanitarian and charitable causes. He also gained government funding for under-privileged Muslim schools in Britain. Yusuf now annually donates over half his income to charity. 

His 1972 album Catch Bull at Four spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, and fifteen weeks at number one in the Australian ARIA Charts. He earned two ASCAP songwriting awards in 2005 and 2006 for ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"", and the song has been a hit for four different artists.[8] His other hit songs include ""Father and Son"", ""Wild World"", ""Peace Train"", ""Moonshadow"", and ""Morning Has Broken"". In 2007 he received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection.

In December 1977, Stevens converted to Islam and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all his guitars for charity and left his music career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He was embroiled in a long-running controversy regarding comments he made in 1989 about the death fatwa on author Salman Rushdie. He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace from two organizations founded by Mikhail Gorbachev.

In 1995, Yusuf Islam (after the silence of eighteen years) released another release ""The Life Of The Last Prophet"" on his own label: Mountain Of Light followed by  ""A For Allah"" in 2000.

With that release and for subsequent ones, he dropped the surname ""Islam"" from the album cover art – using the stage name ""Yusuf"" as a mononym.

In the 2000s, he reemerged to perform publicly for a brief period. He released the 1973 album (theoretically his second album) he worked on at Columbia, and two more albums. He published a book based on raising his daughter as a single parent.

He began working as a player in various bands including the indie-minded Princeton, and later played guitar in the garage pop band Gap Dream. Around 2013, Kivel quit playing with other bands to focus on his solo material. 

The first evidence of his work came in the form of some limited-run cassettes, but he truly came into his own with 2013's full-length album Double Exposure, released on the Olde English Spelling Bee label, which received an 8.0 rating from Pitchfork. Kivel's solo work took a decidedly more subdued path than his previous affiliations, with shimmering ambient synths meeting muted acoustic songwriting and understated vocals. Second album Days of Being Wild, recorded with Palace Brothers member Paul Oldham over the course of one summer, saw release on the Woodsist label in 2014. 

Third and fourth albums Janus and Fires on the Plain were released by Driftless Recordings in 2016. Janus was recorded in Glasgow, Scotland and was produced by folk musician Alasdair Roberts. Fires on the Plain features duets with Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy and Robin Pecknold of Fleet Foxes. 

In 2019, Kivel released his 5th album ""last night in america"" on the Cascine and PYL record labels. AllMusic gave it 4 out of 5 stars and chose it as an ""Album Pick."" In 2020, Kivel released the ambient instrumental album 'that day, on the beach' and in summer of 2022, released a new single, ""find love,"" featuring Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy."

The use of the phrase ""Hillsong United"" was in relation to youth events hosted by the church's youth ministry in which all of the different age groups (junior high [known as 68s], high school [known as Wildlife] and college-aged [known as Powerhouse]) would unite for a single youth service. These large youth events were called ""United"" nights and the early worship albums were recorded during these types of events, hence the phrase ""Hillsong United Live"". These early albums were conducted in a similar fashion to the Hillsong live worship albums where members of the worship team from the Hillsong youth ministry would be rostered to sing on the album, along with the youth choir, which would have also been staffed with team members who were not rostered to sing that night on a mic or play an instrument. Early configurations of the group often featured different singers and players from album to album. As the recordings evolved, Hillsong United formed into a more permanent band with a consistent roster and eventually official band members."

He lives twenty minutes out a decrepit one-and-a-half lane road in the wilderness of the Sierra Nevada foothills with his wife, daughter, and dog, and when he’s not touring he teaches high school Drama and English. He has self-produced four albums, including The Frontman, The Optimist, and an acoustic album From the Pink Room, which was named the #2 album of the year by music site Independent Clauses.

Through grassroots promotion (and a little luck with the algorithms) he’s been heard by half a million people on Spotify, and had his songs streamed over 2 million times. Grover performs live with his band The Lampoliers (Josh Certo, Anthony Delaney, & Marshall Henry), and at least once a year he tours a different region of the United States, performing acoustic shows and house concerts. He’s recently opened for America, Birds of Chicago, The Charlie Daniels Band, and Austin Lucas, and he’s currently booking house concerts all over the US.

Born and raised in Memphis, Rice Drewry has been playing guitar and writing songs for over twenty years. Early influences include the Beatles, James Taylor, and the Eagles mixed with Memphis stew of music including Keith Sykes, John Kilzer, Sam and Dave, and Al Green. Toss in Mellencamp and Tom Petty and you’ll know why his music tends to be pretty eclectic. He has played in several bands including the ""Tumblin' Sneakers""that also played and recorded original music, releasing a self-titled CD in 1999. Rice played acoustic guitar, harmonica and split lead vocal duties for the band, and penned 5 of the songs on the band’s CD.
For the past several years, Rice has continued to play in bands and also honed his songwriting chops, performing around Memphis including Otherlands Coffee Shop, Farmhouse Studios and Minglewood Hall. He has performed at the world famous Bluebird Café in Nashville, TN and has had multiple appearances at the increasingly popular South Main Sounds songwriter nights in downtown Memphis.
Rice released two solo CD’s, “When You Smile” and “Thousand Shades of Gray”, both engineered and produced by Jack Holder (Tracy Chapman, Travis Tritt, Johnny Lang). A single entitled, “When They Were Young”, was released in 2011 honoring WWII veterans and is currently being featured with an organization, “Forever Young Senior Wish” which has taken veterans both to Washington D.C., as well as trips to Normandy, France and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
In 2013, Rice put out his 3rd CD, in collaboration with his band, Six Degrees, entitled, “Rhythm of the Rain”, highlighted by a successful release show at Minglewood Hall’s 1884 Lounge. Two more CD's have followed, ""The Mamba Box"" in 2014 and ""Rice Drewry & 3 Degrees"" was released in 2015, featuring new arrangements and new tunes with Donna Staub on backing vocals and Donna Wolf on the fiddle.
A six song EP was released on March 31, 2017, entitled ""Crisis in the Chakras"". Two of the tracks were recorded at the world famous Royal Studios with Grammy winning engineer, Boo Mitchell, at the helm. Bryan Hayes, at Farmhouse Studios presided over the remaining four tracks and mixed all of the tracks. Kevin Nix mastered. Some of Memphis' finest musicians help bring the songs to life.
Rice continues to play live events with 3 Degrees and in a full six piece band, Rice Drewry Collective, playing both original and band favorite cover tunes. He has a current EP, “Way Out Here” that have an Americana feel, inspired by a tour through Texas a few years ago.

These bio pages are all too professionally vetted... not this one.  Yes.. I grew up. Muncie, Indiana is my hometown. I now live in Indianapolis... blah..blah..blah.  That's the stuff I have to tell ya.... but the real goods are in the songs.  I like to write and perform songs that inspire me. The best songs of my life are like Ridin the Storm Out or Jack and Diane or Friends in Low Places. The songs that take you somewhere else for a few minutes...catapult you into belting out the lyrics!  That is what I am about.  I have worked in many places, played music in lots of festivals, bars, coffee shops and empty rooms. I pull energy from those who are willing to give it to me and I return it with everything my soul will allow. Come take a journey with me...somewhere through a love song, a small town, a back road, into the depths of despair or through the beauty of a gorgeous sunset. This is my music. This is my life.

Thanks for Listening!

Hailing from Chattanooga, Tennessee, Bakalli spent most of his childhood in Gaston County, North Carolina, and he began playing guitar when he was 15. Drawing inspiration from a wide range of artists, including David Allan Coe, Guns N' Roses, and Snoop Dogg, Bakalli soon wanted to make music his career. While still in high school, he formed a band with his friends; inspired by Lynyrd Skynyrd, they named the group Sunny Ledfurd, using a goofy spelling of a friend's name. Playing rap-rock in the manner of Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, the band won a local following with their independent debut album, 1998's Rather Die Young. Thanks to Sunny Ledfurd's indie success, they landed a deal with MCA Records, which released The White Disk in 2001. The album didn't fare well in the marketplace, and the group began to splinter. Bakalli opted to go solo, and took Sunny Ledfurd as his stage name. Rather than dealing with record companies, he started his own Ledfurd Recurds label, and built a home studio to refine his musical ideas. Beginning with The Garage in 2003, Ledfurd began releasing a steady stream of solo product (six albums between 2003 and 2012), with most of his songs dealing with good times and bad behavior. Tunes like ""Pontoon Boat,"" ""Adderal,"" ""Myrtle Beach,"" ""Good to Be a Redneck,"" and ""Strip Club DJ"" established Ledfurd's reputation as a hard-partying Southern bad boy. As his audience grew, he gave newer fans a chance to catch up with the 2012 collection Greatest Hits 2003-2009. He emerged from his studio in 2014 with the album Slick, and fans got a souvenir of Ledfurd's live show with the 2015 concert album Live! Not Televised."

American country musician
Born and raised in a sleepy mountain town in Northern Idaho, singer-songwriter Jeff Crosby has managed to delineate the sometimes amorphous genre of ""Americana"", package it perfectly, and deliver it to his listeners time and again.
His songs present almost as pages ripped out of an intimately personal diary, detailing the rugged beauty of what it means to have loved, lost and kept on the move. There seems to be no shortage of inspiration as Crosby is one of the last few ""troubadours"" that truly lives the life he sings about.
After dropping out of school at 17 to pursue touring full-time with a band on the west coast, he's made his living by permanently staying on the road - night after night, show after show, from load-in until the last drink is poured.
For five years, Crosby hung his hat in a little shoebox apartment off Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, giving up coffee to pay rent and running around with ""The Homeless and the Dreamers"" (a title of a song he wrote paying homage to that time). After a chance encounter in the city, he met and befriended a music editor for the critically-acclaimed television show Sons of Anarchy and subsequently had two songs featured on the program.
Amid treading the scene in L.A. while he was home and touring across the U.S. with his band (and later with Widespread Panic song-writer Jerry Joseph), Crosby had managed to travel abroad to several countries including the United Kingdom, Iceland, Mexico, Colombia and Nicaragua. All of these countries offered experiences that lent themselves to the songs in his newest record, Postcards from Magdalena.
The record was produced and engineered in Portland, OR by Gregg Williams (Dandy Worhals, Blitzen Trapper, Pete Droge, Jesse Malin) and Geoff Piller in Nashville, TN. It has been distributed worldwide with an emphasis in Europe, due to the partnership with At the Helm Records in the U.K. and Blue Rose Records, based in Germany. 
It was lauded by some overseas, including this praise from Mike Davies from Folk Radio UK: ""There’s many an artist out there mining America’s rich musical history and shaping it into their own experiences and observations; Crosby may well be one of the best.”
Now based in Nashville, Jeff continues to tour and share his stories with America at large, offering up a sort of mirror so that it might better see itself. What happens now, only the fates can know. All that is certain is that it will surely be Beautiful and Strange.

Fiddle + guitars + sweet harmonies + a fun dive bar vibe — it all adds up to The Federales, a Minneapolis-based collaboration between six longtime friends and players. Since 2012, fans in the Twin Cities and beyond have lined up for this band’s infectious take on old-school country music.

The Federales are:
Jay Scabich on fiddle and guitar
Mark Larson on drums and percussion
James Gould on vocals, guitar, and piano
Karl Wahoske on vocals, banjo, and guitar
Ben Miller on vocals, guitar, harmonica, and mandolin
Andy Schuster on bass and vocals
It began some years back, when guitarist James Gould (The 4onthefloor) and songwriter Ben Miller started running into each other at parties and found that the talk inevitably turned to Townes Van Zandt, Gram Parsons or the Flying Burrito Brothers. They sought out like-minded musician friends (including a few high school pals and one-time Federales superfan Jay Scabich who took up the fiddle shortly after the band formed) and in 2012 formed The Federales. The band captures the warm sonic textures of the ‘60s and ‘70s recordings they’re drawn to. Think a boisterous Bakersfield dance hall or a music-basted Austin barbecue circa 1975.
While their debut album Blues, Bourbon & Burritos took a straight-ahead approach to Midwestern country sounds and songwriting, their new release Honkytonks & Hangovers leans woozily across a wider swath of American styles — rooted in the present but never jilting the past. Come to any of their shows and just try not to tap your feet. Try harder not to dance. A good time? That’s a given."

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

His mother was a schoolteacher and his father held a factory job. In his family, they were the first generation that didn’t work the farm. As a songwriter and Ten years as a Road Dog, Stephen’s vision has grown to entail more than just reflections of rural America. The songs on his recordings, deal with existential realities that are familiar to country and city dwellers alike: redemption, heartbreak, hangovers and the loneliness of the road. Stephen’s records: Last Call, Drink Ring Jesus, Something In Between, The Blame’s On U.S., Girls, The Big Show and Hearsay (which were compared to everyone from Johnny Cash to Ryan Adams) combine virtuosic songcraft and musicianship with unparalleled artistic honesty. His work has been covered by Mojo Music, Uncut, and The Washington Post. 

Simmons released his debut studio album, Last Call, in 2004. “Lay On The Tracks”, a standout track from Last Call, was a winner at the prestigious MerleFest Chris Austin Songwriting Competition. Last Call was praised by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, picked up and released by Rounder Europe Records; followed by three more Rounder Europe releases and extensive touring in Europe. As a Songwriter with Television credits (Sons of Anarchy) and as a steady road act (over 700 shows in past decade in ten countries) Simmon’s continues to evolve as an artist. His most recent albums have been released by USA indie label Lower 40 Records and in Europe on Germany’s premiere roots label; Blue Rose Records. "

When Kelley Mickwee released her debut solo album, You Used to Live Here, back in 2014, she wasn’t kidding when she described the move as feeling like “totally starting from scratch again” … and more than a little scary. Although she was already a seasoned artist at that point with a decade’s worth of experience under her belt, up until then all of her performing and recording experience had been as part of a unit: first as half of the Memphis-based duo Jed and Kelley, and then as one-fourth of Texas’ acclaimed all-woman Americana group, The Trishas.

But when The Trishas, all living in different parts of the state or as far away as Tennessee, collectively decided to slow their roll a few years back, Mickwee realized that in order to keep living the dream of playing music for a living, she was going to have to strike out on her own. Which she did, beautifully— and may well do again, some day. But right now, three years down the line from her last big career leap, Mickwee is excitedly taking a new one. Only this time it’s not a matter of “starting over from scratch” so much as just learning how to take her hands off the wheel and have fun as a proud member of one the hottest acts in Texas: Shinyribs.

At the heart of all great music is a story, and for that matter, a storyteller. The stories behind Milwaukee-based Buffalo Gospel begin with its founder Ryan Necci and his early introduction, through his father’s record collection, to country music, John Prine and Townes Van Zandt. Growing up in a small, lower middle class farm town, the songs of love and loss and broken blue-collar dreams seeped into him. When he started writing his own music over a decade ago, it was inevitable that the timeless quality of Country/Western and Americana arrangements would profoundly inform his art.

Over a period of a few years, he experienced the dissolution of a marriage and the death of his close friend and writing partner. The immediate response was to quit music and live with his demons, yet as time moved on, writing about the darkness was the only way to keep going. These crystalline bits of bleary, haggard, emotion shine through Buffalo Gospel’s debut album, “We Can Be Horses,” which came out in 2013 to rave reviews. Critics called the work “minimalist and masterful,” “musically arresting,” and “Milwaukee’s Best Kept Secret.”

The band followed up with a critically-acclaimed EP, ‘Waiting For the Lights to Go Out,’ while gathering momentum for their sophomore album. “On The First Bell” was recorded with Grammy award-winning engineer, Brian Joseph (Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, Indigo Girls) at The Hive, nestled quietly in the rural landscape just outside Eau Claire, WI. Necci says, “It was the perfect place for us to record these songs.” The new record has the same strong, country-americana feel as “We Can Be Horses,” combining the band’s dual penchant for hopped up trucker country and breathtakingly honest ballads. Most of these songs would be right at home amidst the 1970s AM radio nuggets gleaned from Necci’s father’s old record collection.

Buffalo Gospel delivers through a virtual “who’s-who” of crack Midwest musicians who have assembled around Necci’s heartfelt and heartbreaking songs – including Kevin Rowe (bass), Nick Lang (percussion), Haley Rydell (fiddle), Andrew Koenig (guitar). The band’s wildcat live performances take listeners to a dusty, forlorn, but strangely familiar place that simply gets sweeter with time."

Currently touring as a solo guitarist and mandolinist along with working on a host of additional musical projects, Andy is also performing live with his own band promoting CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TRUTH AND A LIE, the double album which showcases his vast musical influences and abilities.

Andy has toured professionally with a wide range of acts, including most recently Gary Allan, LOCASH, Rascal Flatts, Scott Stapp, and Sebastian Bach. Looking for an outlet for styles other than hard rock, Andy also released his debut solo album A DISCONCERTING AMALGAM. This instrumental record covers a broad range of genres including fusion, rock, metal, and acoustic bluegrass. Andy Wood is known for blurring the lines of preconceived genres.

Andy spent most of his childhood playing and competing in bluegrass festivals. Touring the bluegrass circuit with his cousin and grandfather provided Andy with the necessary exposure that helped refine and sharpen his skills. Andy and his cousin held various state championship titles.

At the young age of sixteen, Andy finished second in the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MANDOLIN CONTEST in Winfield, Kansas. All of this was accomplished before Andy discovered the world of electric guitar at the age of eighteen.

Fast-forward a few years. Andy’s curiosity and appreciation for music drew him into the world of electric guitars. The new instrument was familiar due to his experience with acoustic instruments, but at the same time, allowed him to manipulate his sound in ways never before possible. He began studying the styles of Nashville session players such as Brent Mason and Albert Lee.

It was not long after Andy had immersed himself in new styles such as jazz, swing, fusion, and rock. Andy began to study other guitar greats such as The Dixie Dregs, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, and Steve Vai. The young guitarist began incorporating their influences into his own style.

At the age of 22, Andy was drawn back to competition in the form of GUITARMAGGEDON, a guitar contest sponsored by Guitar Center. Andy was a face in the crowd of 3,400 other contestants, but he made his presence known by being crowned champion of this prestigious tournament.

Not long after winning Guitarmaggedon, Andy became a founding member of the rock group DOWN FROM UP. They have toured with Seven Dust, Drowning Pool and 10 Years.

As Andy climbs to greater and greater heights, his technical proficiency and tasteful chops makes Mr. Wood a force to be reckoned with, and a name you will not forget. If you find yourself “Caught Between The Truth and a Lie,” you’ll need all the “Charisma” you can get your hands on!"

Coolzey stepped into the public eye around 2005 with a demo album and a series of exploratory DIY tours with rapper/comedian and friend Schaffer the Darklord. Interest spread quickly and Coolzey found himself touring alongside hip-hop legends from Brand Nubian and Jurassic 5 as well as punk rock heroes like Dead Milkmen. Coolzey’s first album ‘The Honey’ was released in 2010 and second official full-length ‘Hit Factory’ in 2013. In these albums as well as in a number of EPs, collaborations and side projects, he finds his niche as a songwriter, navigating hip-hop, rock, punk and pop in the spirit of genre defying influences such as Ween, Beck, The Beastie Boys and Outkast.

Died: May 27th, 2017, Savannah, Georgia
Brother to [a=Duane Allman], Married to actress and singer [a17961] from 1975 to 1979.

Early on the two brothers played in the bands [a=The Escorts (16)] and [a=The Allman Joys].  After moving to California they landed a contract with [l13531] Records and renamed their band to The [a=Hour Glass]. After two psychedelic releases, which Duane didn't like, they split up.

Liberty wanted Gregg to go solo after the breakup of Hour Glass.  However, Gregg became tired of the solo arrangement and rejoined his brother Duane in his newly formed group when they needed a singer.  This was the beginning of [a=The Allman Brothers Band].

Allman began a solo career with [m=217373] in 1973.  He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star Cher.  He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song ""[m=392702]"" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, [m=334304] (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career.  Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir My Cross to Bear (2012). 

Gregg Allman died on May 27, 2017, due to complications from liver cancer.  He was 69 years old.  His final album, [m=1233894], was released posthumously on September 8, 2017."

1744361,800773,2173137,US,Jackson Highway,Jackson Highway,1980,33.12,9,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],[],"Jackson Highway was named by Muscle Shoals producer Jimmy Johnson after the legendary address of the Muscle Shoals Sound Recording Studio in Sheffield, Alabama....3614 Jackson Highway. With that name the band certainly became a part of a special musical family. The founding members of the band, brothers, Dennis and Russell Gulley, along with friend, Tommy Patterson, migrated from Fort Payne, Alabama to the Shoals after several years of working on the road with both regional and national acts, such as Cross from Birmingham and Ruby Winters (Polydor Records recording artist). The Gulley brothers came out of a background of Southern Gospel music, while Patterson was a music student in college. All were searching for a future in music as artists and /or songwriters. Shortly after getting to Muscle Shoals Sound, the trio was joined by guitarist Britt Meacham, and drummer, Ronnie Vance, a native of Florence, Alabama. Britt was a native of Memphis, but had settled in Mobile, Alabama with his new wife, Cheryl. Britt had previously worked with Bell Records recording act, Storm, a rock trio produced by Barry Beckett at MSS (Muscle Shoals Sound). Mike O'rear, the publishing administrator for MSS, was put in charge of demoing the new arrivals for the publishing company and became instrumental in supporting the band members by getting them a house band gig across the Ala.Tenn. state line at a club called Johnny's Club. The band worked there from 1973 till about 1977, when they released their first LP on the Muscle Shoals Sound label, simply titled , ""Jackson Highway"". With the release of their first recording, Jackson Highway began a hard journey that kept them constantly touring throughout the South , colleges, clubs, concert dates, where ever anyone would listen to them. In 1980, their hard work finally paid off with a second LP, produced by the same MSS team of Jimmy Johnson and David Hood. This time the LP was on the MSS/Capitol label. To support the record, the band toured with Ted Nugent, UFO, Triumph, and opened for groups, such as Blackfoot. When Capitol, did not pick up the band's option, the group then moved to Nashville, at the suggestion of hometown friends, the Country Supergroup, ALABAMA. This time, keyboardist, Tommy Patterson chose to stay in Muscle Shoals to do sessions and work for the recording studios. In 1986, after some 13 years together, the band officially disbanded. Since then, the various members have remained in touch, even performing with each other on occasion, and each continues to maintain a musical career. Dennis, lives in Nashville, manages a recording studio with partner, Johnny Neel, formerly of The Allman Brothers and Gov't Mule, and performs at Nashville clubs. He's also toured with ALABAMA and The Moffits. Tommy Patterson is still in Muscle Shoals, works at the recording studios in computer programming, piano tuning, and sessions, gigs locally as well as on the road, with such stars as the legendary, Little Richard. Britt Meacham, lives in Mobile and tours/records regularly with Malaco/Waldoxy Records group, The Beat Daddys. Britt has also toured overseas with Blues Legend, Little Milton. Of course Britt is also famous for supplying some famous guitar licks on the giant rock and roll recording by Bob Seger, Old Time Rock and Roll. Russell Gulley continues to perform and record. He,also is involved with the arts community as a folklorist and community arts administrator. He serves on the board of the Alabama Folklife Association, is active in arts in education programming, and has served his hometown of Fort Payne, as one of the organizers of an annual festival, The Boom Days Heritage Celebration. Ronnie Vance, still resides in Florence, where he is a successful businessman and entrepreneur."
