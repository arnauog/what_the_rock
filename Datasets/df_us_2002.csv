Chris Cruz, Dean Petrella, Anthony Marotti
The Complaints are a modern rock band led by guitarist/frontman Dean Petrella, with bassist Chris Cruz, and drummer Anthony Marotti. Their music is like audio comfort food - it's new, but familiar. You may hear hints of Tom Petty, Radiohead, Cold Play and Matchbox Twenty, while still appreciating their unique sound.

The band formed in 1997 and quickly made their bones playing some of the hottest rock n' roll venues on the east coast including CBGB (R.I.P.), Mercury Lounge, The Bitter End (NYC), Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel (Providence, RI) and The Middle East (Boston).

The Complaints have recorded with some of the biggest engineers/producers in the business: Chris Lord-Alge [Matchbox Twenty, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Green Day, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna], Shelley Yakus [Tom Petty, Don Henley, U2, Suzanne Vega] and Phil Greene [Dropkick Murphys, Mighty Mighty Bosstones].

2019 is lining up to be another great year for The Complaintsas they release their 4th full-length album, Talk to Me. The band is currently also writing material for various soundtracks and continue to perform over 150 shows a year.

The Complaints have shared the stage with many national acts including Train, Gin Blossoms, Sugar Ray [w/ Mark McGrath], Young the Giant, Collective Soul, 3 Doors Down, Nickleback, Guster and have won numerous awards including 'Album of the Year' for Fear in the Providence Phoenix Best Music Poll, 'Best Male Vocalist' and 'Band of the Year' awards in New England's Motif Magazine.

They showcased at SXSW in Austin, TX and Texas Indie Fest (2019) and continue to grow theirf fan base in the US and Europe."

In January 2004, Bittersweet Manics advanced to the semi-finals of the international Emergenza Festival. The band continues to perform throughout the area, including a showcase performance at the Millennium Music Conference (MMC8) in Harrisburg, PA.

Their first album, The New Song And Dance, was produced by [a=Tim O'Heir], came out on Gern Blandsten in 2000.

This album was licensed by City Slang for distribution overseas.

From this album came the [r=208761] remix 12"", which set the band in a more club-oriented direction, carrying the already dance-rock sound further into dance realms. Subsequent work has included more club-friendly remixes and further distribution world-wide.

They released five albums, including 2002's [i][r=3104933][/I] on [l=Virgin].  The band broke up in 2007.

Moth's only constant member was lead singer/guitarist/songwriter [a=Brad Stenz], who co-founded the group as a teenager.  In its earliest incarnation, as a three-piece, Moth recorded a self-titled debut album in 1991.  [I]Moth[/I] was reissued on cassette by James Sfarnas' Holographic Records.  Holographic went on to finance Moth's second album, [i]Big League Fantasy Camp[/i], which was released on CD in 1996.

Moth recorded what was to be a third independent album before signing a production deal with New York agency W&R Group.  The newly recorded material was shopped around to labels, and Virgin signed the group to a deal.  [i][r=3104933][/I] was released in 2002, with early promotion for the record focused on lead single ""I See Sound.""  However, shortly after the album's release, Virgin chose to drop pop singer Mariah Carey (whom it had only recently signed at great expense) from its roster.  The cost of Carey's resulting severance package ($28 million) forced Virgin's parent label, EMI, to completely restructure.  In the process, many employees and artists, including Moth, were let go.

After being dropped from Virgin, Moth resurfaced in 2004 with an independently released fourth album, [i][r=4662952][/i].  A fifth album, [i]Immune To Gravity[/i], followed in 2006 on former A&R executive [a=Todd Sullivan (2)]'s startup label, Hey Domingo!  Following a series of live dates throughout 2006, Brad Stenz ceased work on the group's next record, and Moth officially broke up in 2007.

Having returned to their roots, in name and location, their sound also reverted back to their usual harder rock / metal style.

526444,0,1552771,US,Rock Kills Kid,Rock Kills Kid,2002,0.0,6,['Mini-Album'],['Rock'],['Alternative Rock'],"Rock Kills Kid is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California that consists of Jeff Tucker (guitar and vocals), Shawn Dailey (bass), Sean Stopnik (guitar), Reed Calhoun (keyboards/vocals), and Mike Balboa (drums). Their music often draws comparison to The Cure, Echo & the Bunnymen, Duran Duran and U2, as well as new bands such as The Killers and Franz Ferdinand.
They were named one of Rolling Stone magazine's ""10 Artists to Watch in 2006.

Although there was a period when Jeff Tucker, Kirk Huffman, and Danny ""Extravaganza"" played under the moniker ""The Jeff Tucker Extravaganza"", the initial incarnation of ""Rock Kills Kid"" consisted of Jeff Tucker (vocals, guitar, song-writing), Kirk Huffman (bass), Devin Kelly (guitar, b/g vocals, piano), and Chris Poulson (drums, b/g vocals). This version of Rock Kills Kid toured moderately across the United States in support of the debut self-titled 5-song EP released in early 2003 by Fearless Records.
During the end of the self-titled EP tour, the band also recorded two songs with producer/engineer Ariel Rechtshaid (formerly of ""The Hippos""). The songs were titled ""Still Standing"" and ""Farewell."" The former track ""Still Standing"" appeared on a Fearless Records Promotional CD: 2003 And Beyond... and was remade later on the album Are You Nervous? and retitled the track, ""Hope Song"". The latter was included with a bonus disc inside select copies of the Fearless Records Punk Goes Acoustic compilation.
Following this period, with no money and no place to live, Tucker began sleeping at the recording studio Fearless was paying for in Los Angeles while writing songs for the first-coming full-length album. During this time, the group had a slight line-up change, and they regrouped with a newer line-up consisting of drummer; Poulson, bassist; Dailey, and guitarist; Stopnik. The band shortly added keyboardist/guitar/bg-vox; Reed Calhoun, to the line-up, while drummer Poulson had parted ways with the band in mid/late 2005. After the full-length album had wrapped in the studio, the band added on drummer; Sam Kearney for a fall 2005 tour with the band, Electric Six. Near the end of the tour the band parted with Kearney, and brought drummer; Ian Hendrickson on board, and toured in 2006 with band, She Wants Revenge, which further boosted their profile, as did the use of ""Hide Away"" on an episode of Fox television drama The O.C..
They signed to Reprise Records and toured extensively in support of their debut album, Are You Nervous (with drums played by Kenny Livingston of Sugarcult and production/engineering tasks given to Mark Trombino) who recorded drums at Hollywood Recording and the rest at Doug Messenger's hard drive analog and digital in North Hollywood.
""Hide Away"" was an iTunes free download in April 2006. ""Paralyzed"" is the first single off ""Are You Nervous"" and was sent to radio that same month. ""Paralyzed"" was played during the credits of the 2008 feature film Prom Night."

By age two, she began playing the piano, and at age 9 became obsessed with ballet. She joined the School of American Ballet at age 14, living in a dorm at Lincoln Center and enrolling in the Professional Children's School. During her time at the academy, she continued playing the piano and writing songs, nurturing her blossoming songwriting skills. Upon graduation, she moved to Hell's Kitchen, where she waitressed five nights a week and performed at local clubs on open mic nights, honing her craft and developing a stage presence. At home, she would often stay up until 4 a.m. recording demos on a four-track machine, and was signed to A&M Records in 2001. Her first video, for the song ""A Thousand Miles,"" was released even as she continued recording her debut album, and it became an instant smash on MTV, as well as cracking the American Top Ten. This lead Rolling Stone magazine to name her as one of the 'Top Ten Artists to Watch in 2002.'

Wilco’s brand of classic roots rock incorporates folk, pop and genre-spanning experimentalism.

The band’s catalog includes 2002’s Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (named one of the 500 greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone), 2005’s Grammy award-winning A Ghost is Born, the Grammy-nominated Wilco (The Album) and The Whole Love and more. NPR has called Wilco “the best rock band in America” and the band has been heralded by the Los Angeles Times as “an amazing machine whose six players seem more at one with their music than any rock group working today.” The Wilco catalog includes Mermaid Avenue Volumes 1, 2 and 3, which, in collaboration with British folk singer Billy Bragg, sets original music to song lyrics by the iconic Woody Guthrie."

The rest of the band later joined as a result of continual experimental gigs performed around the Shimokitazawa (Tokyo) area. Their creative use of analog synthesizers and the old Casitone, incorporated with influences of such bands as Weezer and The Rentals, and at times the dynamism of Snuffesque rock, had transformed them into a powerfully melodic guitar band. By the end of 1998, Beat Crusaders had already started creating songs which emphasized they were a crazy and fun live act that was not to be missed.
During all promotional appearances, their faces are masked by drawings resembling themselves as printed by a dot-matrix printer.
In 2010, Toru Hidaka confirmed that Beat Crusaders would break-up."

Before the all the members will reach their 21st birthdays in 2003, Sidereal has alredy been performing and writing together for almost 7 years. The band was formed in 1997 in Sheridan, IN (just north of Indianapolis) and performed nameless for 2 years. Originally a five member group led by female vocals, the band has since changed bassists and switched to a front man. It wasn't until this change that the band took the name  Sidereal, which is defined as the true orbital period of a planet.  After four years of continuous playing, Sidereal's bassists decided to pursue other  adventures. Although Sidereal lost an important member, they brought a new talent  into the group.  After a year with Sidereal, its current bassist had to go to college.  Sidereal's original bassist decided to come back and jam with the band. The band has since dealt with its losses and moved on to better Sidereal and form a new, better sound.    
The band members are Brad Greeman (vocals, guitar), Ben Sutton (guitar), Andrew Wall (drums, percussion), and Derik Ervin (bass). They have an  eclectic  sound that has been compared to bands ranging from Cold to Silverchair to Incubus.

Based in Houma, Louisiana, the band was fronted by Dax Riggs (formerly of Acid Bath and Agents of Oblivion). Riggs conceived the name as a combination of both the early New York punk band Dead Boys, which he refers to as ""Deadboys"", and his former band Acid Bath's song ""Dead Girl"", as well as the David Lynch film The Elephant Man.

After disputes with an independent label over the distribution of their debut album ""If This Is Hell, Then I'm Lucky"", the band signed a three-record deal with Fat Possum.

 For the latter part of 2005, and most of 2006, they toured in support of their major label debut ""We Are Night Sky"" playing from bars and smaller venues to Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and Bonnaroo. 

In early 2006, Riggs recruited his former Agents of Oblivion bandmate, Alex Bergeron, to play bass on tour. Later that year, the band was primarily a duo of Riggs and Tessie Brunet. This line-up was often compared to The White Stripes in reviews, and their music is sometimes referred to as ""swamp rock."" By 2007, Brunet left the band and Riggs went on to a solo career.

lowell was active from 1998-2001 and was created at The University of Maryland, Baltimore County by Greg Rago (Guitars), Michael W. Nestor (Guitars/Vocals), Chris Shelley (Drums), and Matt Crum (Bass). After recording a self-titled EP in March 1999, Mike Cichocki joined on bass. While building an audience by releasing a series of EPs and playing shows in Baltimore and DC, lowell was featured on area radio stations like WRNR, WWDC, WIYY and WHFS-as well as on Baltimore-area college radio.

lowell recorded a debut full-length with Frank Marchand in July, 2001-titled ""The Ten Houses and the Falling Leaves. "" In the fall of 2001, the band broke up without officially releasing the record. In early 2002 ""Houses"" was released by Nestor along with an EP of additional tracks titled ""B-Sides And Hidden Treasures"". 

lowell played music influenced by the combination of post-rock, alternative rock, late 90's emo, and late-90's Midwest college indie rock (Hum, My Vitriol, Radiohead, The Promise Ring, Sunny Day Real Estate). The Maryland Music Monthly said in a 2002 review of ""Houses""... ""lowell showcases their indie chops and their ability to write dark but memorable rock music...very impressive...the band proves that it can build a sonic landscape that can lull you into quiet places before soaring you to varying heights.""  Releasing ""Houses"" inspired Nestor (Underlined Passages, ex-The Seldon Plan, Pupa's Window) to form the Beechfields Record Label. Rago went on to form the well regarded Baltimore band Yeveto. "

Together, they started writing songs and completed the rhythm section by recruiting bass player Todd Burnes and drummer Ray Blanco.

About 5 months after forming, the band independently recorded and produced an EP which they passed out at their shows; along with their explosive live performances, this recording began to spark label interest and eventually led to them getting signed with Maverick Records in early 2001. Add to this a rapidly growing fan base and gigs playing with the likes of Stone Temple Pilots, Tenacious D, Incubus, Weezer and Hoobastank.
In May 2002, Home Town Hero's self-titled debut album was finally released; the first single, ""Questions"", exhibited the harder edge of their music while simultaneously combining the harmonious tones of Bruno's vocals, the second single, ""Eighteen"", displayed the diversity of the album, with a very melodic yet Rock oriented feel.

After nearly four years of silence, Aaron Bruno and Drew Stewart started a new project called Under The Influence Of Giants.

Active in the 1990s and 2000s, Breech embodied the musical vision of Missy Gibson and Mike Flanagan. Gibson came to Los Angeles from Detroit where her performances gained citywide attention, receiving praise from such press outlets as the Detroit Metro Times, who dubbed her ""the best independent singer/songwriter in the country."" Primary Critic for The All Music Guide, and Rolling Stone contributor Thom Jurek writes, ""Breech's songs reveal the beauty in human flaws, the subtleties of passion, and the dynamics of anger. They are raw, gutsy, frail, tainted with the stain of life and to the bone."" Gibson has also maintained a publishing deal with EMI since 1998. Mike Flanagan, a native Angelino, has received many accolades for his multi-instrumentalist and songwriting abilities.  “Flanagan is a striking talent… an impressive songwriter… a commanding vocalist… (with) Elvis Costello’s tunefulness and full-bore passion…” says the Los Angeles Times.  

Breech has consistently delivered praiseworthy releases, including their self-titled debut (1999), cd single Junk (2000), the above-mentioned Apron Strings (2002) and Demos Dust and Debris (2003), a collection of live acoustic tracks and recordings seldom heard.  Their last release was Tarnish and Undress (2007).
 
Breech’s music has been featured in film and television, on shows such as the WB’s ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Black Sash.”  They have also appeared on Canadian TV's ""Much Music,"" and PAX TV’s “Ed McMahon’s Next Big Star.” Breech have toured the country extensively on their own, as well as opening for many national acts, including Weezer, the late Jeff Buckley, White Stripes and Liz Phair.

The Rentals broke up in 1980 and Jeff & Jane relocated to Manhattan where they opened for Suicide and quickly signed with No Wave label Lust/Unlust. Their first single No Clubs was released in late 1980 and showcased a lo-fi avant garde all synthesizer band. The World Trade EP came next in 1981, expanding their brand of post-nuclear electronic pop. Their vocals qualities were distinct; Jeff quivery and drug-addled while Jane more detached and icy.
The duo reached their pinnacle with 1982′s seminal Flesh. Perhaps one of the United States biggest achievements in the entire “synth” movement of the 80s. The music was electro-pop employing early Roland synths and the TR-808 drum machine. Jeff’s lyrics flirted with technology and politics, while Jane wrote about cultural and psychological situations. Completely self produced by the band, the record has since been oft-cited as a groundbreaking and pivotal LP of the post-punk era, who’s original copies are now heavily coveted by collectors. Completing the discography is the Special World 7″ released in 1983. In 1985 the band stopped performing and recording. In 1986, Jeff started to direct music videos
and Jane produced video art. Both were teaching at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
In 1995, JEFF AND JANE reformed and performed for a couple of years and recorded again (ZETA BREW). The new music was more guitar-based and psychedelic. Jeff’s project for 1998 was GIGANTOR, a trip-hop techno 3D video multimedia show. This show was performed at The Bank in New York and the Middle East in Cambridge. In 2002 the band completed the “Burn” album where they covered some of their classic hits such as “Los Alamos” and “Pound Pound” with a punk rock atmosphere. As of 2011 Jeff and Jane have begun performing in Massachusetts and recording material for various labels, including Electric Voice Records.

The band members John Pyro (lead vocals/drums), Tom Morgan (lead & steel guitars), Matt O’Bryan (rhythm guitar/vocals) and Frank Budd (bass/harmonica) have been creating music together exclusively since 1993 when they formed the band Miracleberries, a jazz-tinged rock band.  The band released Happy Hour in 1997 to critical acclaim.  Soon after, the band’s sound evolved to a country-rock sound and The Wrenfields were born. 

 

The Wrenfields’ first album 21st Century Pioneer (2002) and follow-up release Seconds (2003)both received international critical acclaim.  In 2005, the band teamed up with Gary Louris, alt-country icon and Jayhawks front man, who along with Ed Ackerson, produced and recorded Green Man’s Ghost (2010) at Ackerson’s Flowers Studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Looking for a more dynamic sound the the band added Todd Robert to the mix. Pulling from the four's wide range of influences the band's unique sound started to come together. The fuller sound help produce the bands next effort ""Crumbs "". With great reception and a committed following the band continued to play out, write and record new material.

In mid-2001, Todd left the band on good terms to pursue an outside business venture. After trying out several guitar players the band decided on Rod Toliver, formerly of Ice Station Zero.

They mix elements from both heavy metal and hip-hop.

The band formed after the group [a=L.A.P.D. (4)] disbanded. L.A.P.D. consisted of [a=Reginald Arvizu], [a=James Shaffer], and [a=David Silveria], and singer [a=Richard Morill]. Morill left because of drug addictions and the remaining 3 members along with [a=Brian Welch], who was a close friend of the band, began searching for a new singer. They found that singer in 1993 when seeing the frontman of the band [a=Sex Art], [a=Jonathan Davis], perform. Davis joined the band, which was renamed ""Creep"" and shortly after ""Korn"". Three of the band members are often credited by their nicknames: ""Head"" (Welch), ""Fieldy"" (Arvizu), and ""Munky"" (Shaffer).

Welch left Korn in 2005 after his decision to rededicate his life to Jesus Christ and his daughter. In 2006, drummer Silveria would follow, stating he stepped out of the band to further pursue his entrepreneurial ventures and to be with his family. Korn went on as a 3-piece and had a back-up band for touring until 2009. In 2009, drummer [a=Ray Luzier] became the first new member of Korn since its formation in 1993, after being in the back-up band for a while. In May 2013, Welch rejoined Korn.

Mynis is a four piece progressive hard rock band formed in 1998 in the central California city of Fresno. Mynis is made up of Matty Gonzales on Drums, Robert Gonzalez on Guitar, Jason Benham on bass, and Tom Vlahavas on vocals/percussion. Mynis, whose style goes beyond any genre, has developed many loyal and devoted fans all over the country. They have survived many scenes and shared the stage with many diverse and different styles of music from heavy metal, to hardcore, to punk and anything else you can imagine.
Hitting early gigs on Warped Tour 2000, 2001 and also playing many big local events sponsored by Fresno radio stations such as New Rock 104 and 103.7 KRZR led them to great success early on. This success helped launch them into a very productive and eventful career which continues on today. Since their formation in the late 90's they have shared the stage with such acts as Weezer, 311, Alien Ant Farm, Zebra Head, Pennywise and many, many more. Playing with such acts and doing extensive touring throughout California helped them catch the ear of high profile producer Sylvia Massy Shivy (known for her work with Tool, System Of A Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Prince). They recorded their first full length album during the winter of 2003 with Sylvia and release it through independent label 5k records. This album helped launch them into full west coast touring and nation wide recognition. Their single ""Bye Tomorrow"" entered heavy rotation on local channel 103.7 KRZR and many other stations across the country in Texas, Ohio, New York, Nevada and Arizona, just to mention a few.
Mynis, whose live show has left many stunned, keep hard at work writing and recording and are ready to dive into the next level of their career. With positive attitudes and a drive that won't quit, Mynis continues to tour and catch the ear of many. Their willingness to succeed is only superseded by their unmatched original sound. The Mynis website still receives hundreds of hits daily. After selling more then 20,000 records with little promotion other than touring, some radio exposure and word of mouth alone, the band continues to thrive and grow in popularity. Give them a listen! You won't be disappointed. Go see a live show and you will never be the same!

Biography:
Pulse Ultra was initially formed as Head Space in 1997 by guitarist Dominic Cifarelli and bassist Jeff Feldman. Drummer Maxx Zinno was added that same year, followed by vocalist Zo Vizza two years later.

Pulse Ultra's break came in 2000 when the band met Taproot, with Cifarelli later passing on one of their demos to the band. Taproot guitarist Mike DeWolf, through their management team Velvet Hammer, later got the band signed with Atlantic Records.

After a year of songwriting, the band issued their debut album Headspace on July 16, 2002. The band would appear on the Ozzfest tour that year in support of the album's release. Subsequently, the album failed to push the band into the mainstream. In early 2004 the band went back to L.A. to work on the follow up to ""Headspace"". A few months into pre-production, Atlantic Records merged with AOL/TIME/WARNER. This resulted in Pulse Ultra being dropped due to minimal record sales.

At some point during mid-2004, tensions grew between the band and Zo, which soon after would lead Pulse Ultra to look for a new vocalist. In a post on the band's official forum, Zo stated that the split was amicable and they were all on good terms. Despite finding a replacement in Lukas Rossi, the band would disband shortly after. They are now all involved in other projects. Dominic Cifarelli (guitarist) released his debut solo project The Chronicles Of Israfel in 2007."

The In Out draws from an amalgam of styles reflecting the musical fantasies of a 
peculiar gathering of three North American men. Rockabilly, Prog, white R&B, so-called 
Post/Punk, Glam and Metal are all in the mix, and the singing upholds the tradition 
of snide non-vocalists such as Sky Saxon and Mark E. Smith.

“Underrated” is a favorite adjective lobbed at the band and “Sounds like The Fall” 
was recently upgraded to “Sounds like The Cramps meets The Fugs.”

As one musician friend states (correctly): “The In Out are one of the few bands out 
of Boston that transcends local band status.” It’s proven to be very danceable and 
yes, they are quite popular with the ladies.

Think: How can you go wrong with songs about Line Cooks and non-hygienic handshakes, 
and a hard rock anthem for the terminally ill? The only thing missing is a tribute 
to the Gay Triple A – and that may be coming. Stay Tuned."

Slowly building their repertoire while touring the local club scene, the band (eventually rounded out by guitarist Louis Polito, bassist Clay Yeagley, and drummer G.J. Gosman) was eventually spotted by AC/DC singer Brian Johnson (himself a local resident), who was impressed enough to help them secure management and produce their independent debut, 1998's Seed. Containing a lackluster set of middle of the road heavy metal, the album failed to impress and it wasn't until the arrival of its hard-grooving follow-up, 1999's very impressive Living in Dog Years, that Neurotica truly found its sound and direction. Also produced by Johnson and featuring new bassist Migwell Przybyl, the album's diversified songwriting was light years removed from its modest predecessor and eventually earned the band a major-label deal with the W.W.E.'s Smackdown Records. Further lineup changes ensued, including the arrivals of new guitarist Chris Rollo and drummer Jason West and, interestingly, the band was then given a nu metal makeover prior to releasing 2002's Neurotica. Ironically, the bulk of the album simply offered updated versions of the sophomore disc's best cuts, with a few new tracks thrown in for good measure. The band then embarked on that year's ill-fated Ozzfest tour, which was marred by everything from last-minute cancellations (due to Sharon Osbourne's ongoing cancer treatment) to the tragic death of Drowning Pool singer Dave Williams."

Kyros (formerly known as Kyrosgp6) was formed in late '97 by front-man Luciano Pesci, and dj. Soul Kutts.  The two quickly acquired interest in the project and recruited many local musicians.  The first of which was drummer Derek Peterson.  After an extensive shifting of members, the band was in its current line up by early '99.  Within one month, the band was back on the scene playing shows around the state.  In early 2000, the band signed a deal with Megaton Records™ and went into the studio with producer-engineer, and former WWF™ wrestler, Maxx Payne. They quickly fine-tuned their sound and started tracking their debut album by march of 2000.
  In September, the group again joined forces with a well established producer, Dave Sussman.  Together with Payne and Sussman they completed their album, which released in March of 2001.  In august of 2001 the band signed a management deal with Fulcrum Entertainment.  Fulcrum quickly had them touring up and down the western United States with bands like 311, One Side Zero, Hoobastank, and many others.  Their sound has continued to amass a large following and with the forthcoming album, to hit stores and radio in March 2002, this following will become even larger.

More than just a band, the Seattle-based rock ‘n’ roll group, Suitcase, is at the center of a musical family. Born of musical companionship and often found in the comfy confines of the historic Earwig Studio in the city’s Wallingford neighborhood, the group’s steady momentum is fueled by the energy it’s provided by fans, friends and kinfolk alike. Earwig, which has been home to many an act looking to cut a standout record, buoys the group as a home base, the center of a network of support and song.
Suitcase, which released its breakout record, Lisabuela, in 2001, subsequently performed two coveted sessions on the famed radio station, KEXP, playing the Audioasis show with KEXP mainstay host, DJ John Richards, along with a one-hour set on The Live Room. The band also caught the attention of R.E.M. guitarist, Peter Buck, who praised the “really good” group in an interview with The Big Takeover (issue #43), saying, “Geez, I haven’t seen a band that was unheralded in a long time that I liked.”
In 2017, the group re-formed after an invitation to play the popular Emerald City music festival, Upstream. Original co-founders Don Farwell (owner of Earwig) and Ed Otto added Clint Hoyler on bass and Joe Patterson on drums. Together, they recorded a new record, Come Back. Full of introspective lyrics and honeycomb hooks, the album is set for a 2019 vinyl release. After playing prominent Emerald City stages like the Crocodile and the Tractor in the 90s and early 2000s, the band is back for more. Why? Because family is forever.

These large youth events were called ""United"" nights and the early worship albums were recorded during these types of events, hence the phrase ""Hillsong United Live"". These early albums were conducted in a similar fashion to the Hillsong live worship albums where members of the worship team from the Hillsong youth ministry would be rostered to sing on the album, along with the youth choir, which would have also been staffed with team members who were not rostered to sing that night on a mic or play an instrument. Early configurations of the group often featured different singers and players from album to album.

""The musical landscape of Detroit is unconventional, to say the least. Music is the lifeblood of the city, and it is given a special twist by its bands. They do things differently in the Motor City, with a unique musical perspective that is innovative and sometimes conceptual, but always ties together all the influences to create a sound that just plain rocks.
It's with this attitude that a new band steps into the ring. THROTTLEBODY is already creating a stir in the citys rock community with an explosive and fresh approach to heavy music. Combining elements of electronic music and metal, the band has created a multi-dimensional sound that is built on solid songwriting - first and foremost.
Andy, Kyle, and Mike were formerly in a band called Solid Frog, signed to the Detroit-based independent label Overture/Overcore. That bands (2) full-length releases built a sizable and dedicated following that has stuck with the band as they have progressed and mutated into the current project. THROTTLEBODY was officially formed at the end of 2000 with the addition of Aaron on bass guitar, building a new sound that incorporates all the undeniable hooks that Solid Frog was well known for and the increasingly heavier direction that the band had been taking. Describing THROTTLEBODYs momentum, The Detroit Free Press says, Shedding the old outfits pop persona to attack a much heavier rock sound, the group is quickly taking its place amongst Detroits heavy hitters. The result is a streamlined and potent collection of songs that are both punishing and infectious.
THROTTLEBODY is already making noise on WRIF in Detroit and Radio X in Flint, MI.

2001 yielded an ambitious collaboration with more than a dozen artists. 
Crystalline combined the talents of Axoe, Bloodwire, Dia, Fonta Hadley, Halou, Peter Harrison, Hungry Lucy, and Andrew Lindsay into a cohesive and extremely moving collection.

2002 was the most abitious project yet: gradient is a 2 volume adventure through many seemingly diverse and contradictory styles, but somehow, it all works!

They had to wait until 1997 to unleash their first single Electrocute (later covered by The Hellacopters on their last album Head Off) and their 1998 Thomas Skogsberg produced debut mini album “Demons” Come Bursting Out! The band was contracted to Gearhead Records between 1999 and 2004 and released three full length albums for them. The label constructed a new genre for the band, punk ‘n’ roll, which is widely used these days. After Gearhead they turned down several larger labels and one big time producer in favor of managing themselves and designing, producing and putting out their own records (as well as collaborating with other independent labels). Despite the band’s efforts, hard work and pushing Scandinavian rock overseas they have remained underground and even obscure in their home country. However, there is no question of their importance to the late ’90s early 2000s punk and garage scenes. Unlike so many of their peers “DEMONS” never quit playing. "

With Bats & Mice members all involved in other bands, such as Milemarker and Rah Bras, the band moved along at a slower pace. Jonathan left the group temporarily to focus his other bands, Denali and Engine Down. Replacing him were Daron Hollowell and Ash Bruce from Four Hundred Years.

The band recorded a full-length album entitled Believe It Mammals, which was released on Lovitt in the spring of 2002, followed by touring with acts like Fugazi, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, 90 Day Men, Denali, Rah Bras, and Gregor Samsa.

After Hollowell and Bruce left the group to pursue a new project Jay Murphy took over on drums, followed by Luke Herbst, who helped the band record Bats & Mice's second EP, A Person Carrying a Handmade Paper Bag is Considered as a Royal Person. Herbst left the band in 2004 for Oakland, CA, to join Totimoshi, and Jonathan Fuller briefly rejoined the group.

Ross Records released the group's debut single ""New Species Anthem"" in 1997, resulting in immediate Tiger Trap and Fastback comparisons. The hybrid of indie-pop-punk continued in 1999 as the group's own Chromosome Records put out the album Secret Luminaries in January 1999. Dunn departed soon after its release to join the Bangs and Dub Narcotic Sound System. The No-No's continued on as Chromosome issued the 2000 EP Damage Done and the full-length Tinnitus in mid-2000.

North Sea Story / Working for Wellness / 
North Sea Story's music is nice, blustery, melodic punk rock. If I wanted to, I could probably get away with applying a certain three-letter description that begins with ""e"" and ends with ""o""...but I won't.  The crashing guitars and indie rock furor you'll find here is rather unlikely to surprise you, though elements of post-rock progression in tunes like ""80 Through Ohio"" and ""The Last Wound-UP"" keep the proceedings from going too far up Boring Cookie-Cutter Rock Music Street.  In addition to sounding great, this apparently self-released CD is beautifully packaged in a lovingly designed yet affordably minimal cardboard slipcase -- the sort that makes you super-eager to open it and get at the indie-rock treasure inside.  Fans of Paul Newman (the band) will love it.

North Sea Story - Working For Wellness
Being an old fart, I've become accustomed to looking for influences when listening to newer bands. You may be asking yourself what that character flaw of mine has to do with anything - well, let me finish. North Sea Story may or may not have ever even heard some of my favorite bands from the late 80's, but that doesn't mean they don't fit nicely in between my Frontier and Twin/Tone albums. 

North Sea Story play songs with a cheerful sort of aggression. There's nary an ounce of anger on this disc, but a lot of sugar sweetness masquerading itself as post-punk, emo, or whatever else you want to tag it. I'm finding it hard to decide whether or not what they're doing is a decade out of style or if it's the very beginning of a renaissance I wasn't even expecting. 
""High Water Mark"", with it's dual guitar interplay, pounding beat, and fist-pumping chorus, is a perfect example of what this album's all about. More or less, Working For Wellness is a soaring anthem from beginning to end. Let's hope they'restarting something rather than finishing it.

NORTH SEA STORY ""Working For Wellness"" CD (self release)
I'm taking it that the North-East is going through this pop thing now a days, but it's sort of folk R.E.M/ LIVE sounding. Anyway, you've got this band...They're straight up pop, the style reminds me of what people used to consider indie-pop in the early 90's. When R.E.M. were reaching their top time and Super Chunk were getting noticed. This is not so much punk but with definite distorted  guitars and rocking parts. It's a little too ""MTV"" sounding at times if you know what I mean but it's something i could see rub off on me if i listened to it enough. I really like a song on here entitled ""Bicentennial Quarters"". On this song they added violins and such which i think is good for them. You get 10 spanking songs and this is not so bad, so go check it out.(JK) 

NORTH SEA STORY - Working For Wellness, Self Released, CD (1999)
WHEN PORTLAND OREGON'S Dharma Bums broke up in 1992 I was bummed for a year (maybe more). Listening to Brooklyn NY's NORTH SEA STORY makes up for my loss every time I spin Working For Wellness. They're not a BUMS clone. Its the uncanny similarity by both singers (Chris Standish and David Brown) to that of Jeremy Wilson--and that for me is a good thing to listen to. Even better, is that  they do in fact have their own style. Dynamically the songs are set in a particular mood. One that arrives the listener at a beginning-middle-end. The drama that unfolds from rock tempo'd songs like ""High Water Mark"" and ""Butterknife"" are things of many happy returns. Same's true for the notesnatching crafty emittences of the locked down jug of ""80 through Ohio."" But I suppose what I like best about Working For Wellness is their ability to change moods without sacrificing taste. Delivering a spirited run of 11 tracks of guitar rock brushed slightly with an artful eye.

Delusions of Adequacy
First, let me say that this is one of the best produced and packaged self-released albums that I've seen and heard in quite some time. The packaging is very subtle yet attractive, and the sound quality is impeccable. North Sea Story, despite having a very emo name, aren't really emo. The band plays long rock songs with strong rhythm, dazzling guitars, and interesting vocals. Sometimes sounding country, sometimes southern, sometimes just passionate, the vocals here are mixed up front enough to shine. At times the southern feel distracts me from the music itself, but it's easy to overlook that after a few listens.

""Pigeon Falls"" sounds like a more rocking Jayhawks song. On this song most of all, the singer's voice sounds very southern or Americana rock. ""80 Through Ohio"" is quite a beautiful rock song, the guitar work just amazing here, flowing and riff-intensive, the vocals rising and falling quite impressively, building to a scream by the end of the song  as the drums and bass build along. But the band proves they can play slower, prettier songs as well, such as the six-minute ""Bicentennial Quarter,"" complete with soft and pretty guitars and strings just barely audible in the background. Similar loud rockers like ""Just Like the Movies"" contrast with the more restrained and quiet numbers, like ""Longshoreman's Vote."" Elements of popular artists like Counting Crows can be heard here, but I'm more thrilled by the feeling of bands like Sordid Humor and Engine 88. ""Butterknife"" is a good example of the band's style, rocking hard but slowing down at parts, the vocals strained almost to the point of a scream but restrained throughout, the guitars driving along throughout. ""Open Invitation"" is slow and moving, slowly speeding and intensifying, at times both pretty and intense.

So, I don't really know anything about the band themselves, other than the fact that, despite the southern sounding vocals, the band is from Brooklyn, N.Y. Strings fill in the empty spaces, as does soft piano, but, primarily, NSS is a rock band. Falling somewhere between indie rock and emo rock with a harder rocking emphasis at times, North Sea Story could be a radio friendly band if they every played anyone quite this good. They would go a long way toward breaching the gap between some very different styles of rock as well.

North Sea Story 
Working For Wellness
This is surely one of those discs that you love the second your ears here the melodic wonder. The mix of cello and repetitive guitar work reminds me of a slowed down Jimmy Eat World. Its  emotionally driven heart filled music that's enough to leave you floating in space, forgetting all the pains of life. It was enough for me to forget about the surgery I had been through. The throbbing just seemed to fade, as if the music was some sort of God sent healing remedy. I might be getting a little carried away here, but I really like this music. I have only listened to the first song by this point.  Its titled ""Pigeon Falls"" and it's certainly a masterpiece, enough to get this band popular (in what ever way moving, emotional music can be).

Ooops… I put the cd player at random and I am now listening to track 10. Wow…still sounds pretty good. My guess right now is that it sounds pretty good the whole way through. Let me go ahead and change it back to track 2. Yep it sounds pretty good. The only flaw I can see is that the vocals seem sort of dull and you can't hear them very good. The instrumentation is what caught me here anyway. This stuff really doesn't need vocals, but I guess they just decided to add it in. The tone is just really nice sounding on the guitar and even though it is repetitive and some what simple (like most emo). It's addicting and very lovable. If I were to go comparing this to some other bands I would have to say it sounds most like, Pedro The Lion, Saint Sophia and slow Jimmy Eat World and Sunfactor. The strings in the music almost makes it sound like classical music only not.

Actually these guys aren't just slow like I originally thought. I was just listening to the slow songs because I was still on random. They actually have a lot of diversity. See, they keep getting better and better. The vocals still aren't my favorite, but if you are more of a fan of the instrumental part of emo music, then I would bet you might want to go pick this one up. It comes in a cardboard  cover, which I found to be pretty neat. I'm not sure that's the way it usually comes, but it could be. I'm also not sure who their record label is. I will have to figure it out. If you want this cd I would try emailing them or sending them snail mail.

Floater grew out of Eugene, Oregon and was quickly signed to a small independent label called Elemental Records. After two quick albums, the band moved to Portland, Oregon where they remain today.

Floater started out as a predominantly metal/hard rock band. Their earlier songs were centered around bass driven mechanics with subtle influences from Primus and hard rock bands. The early albums also had a handful of acoustic songs, too.

By their third album, more emphasis was placed on the guitar sounds of David Amador. Their sound slowly transitioned from chunky primal rhythms to more loose hard rock sound with many musical suggestions from the likes of Pink Floyd, The Doors, and eventually later on bands like The Police, U2, Jane's Addiction, and many more.

The band tours extensively in the Pacific Northwest and occasionally making a tour once a year throughout California, Arizona, Nevada, and sometimes Utah. Their shows are the bread and butter for Floater fans. The shows are rather well-performed with surprise jams, extensions, and covers. The band has a rather devoted fan-base on the West coast that attends a large majority of their shows whenever possible."

After recruiting ex-Sarge drummer Russ Horvath and ex-Chisel bassist and law school classmate Chris Norberg. Due to the strenuous schedule with law school and the heavy tour from their first 5 song demo, Horvath and Norberg had to call it quits. Soon after, Elmore recruited ex-Moreno guitarist Sean Hulet, drummer Scott Rosenquist, and ex-Andiamo bassist Joel Root.

Elmore took a temporary leave of absence from law school to focus on the band before signing to Initial Records in 2001. After a name and some line-up changes, the band settled on the name ""The Reputation"" which was a backlash at certain members of the indie music scene who promoted speculation about her sex life.

In 2002, their self titled debut album was met with positive critical acclaim with the LA Times, CMJ, and Village Voice leaving much praise. After securing a new drummer in Matt Espy, the band embarked on a North American tour. In 2003, amidst touring, songwriting, and a return to law school, the band lost yet another drummer due to personal reasons.

The end of 2003 saw the band going into the studio to record their follow up ""To Force a Fate"", which was released on Lookout! in April of 2004. The album was anything but easy as Elmore was finishing law school, touring with the band, and writing songs, and 14 hour studio days kept ""The Reputation"" quite busy. This experience was different for the band in that the other members assisted Elmore in the songwriting process.

Like their debut album, ""To Force A Fate"" was met with positive reviews from leading publications like Entertainment Weekly, Spin Magazine, and Blender describing her vocal prowess and the jabs of her learned history reflecting in the songwriting style. The album shot up the CMJ charts that year to #58.

The band drew comparisons to the Fastbacks, Liz Phair, Neil Young, and Elvis Costello whose song ""Almost Blue"" was featured in their self titled debut as a cover. In late 2006, after going through 5 drummers and several other line up changes, Elmore announced that the band had broken up. (Lookout Records)"

Andrea Lisi (guitar) and Basla Andolsun (bass) were attending Virginia Commonwealth University together. The latter introduced Lisi and Katy Otto (drums) to each other.

After a few quick months of writing and rehearsing songs, their first show was in Richmond, Virginia, on May 10, 2001. Del Cielo's first release, a split 7"" with the now defunct Denver band, Sin Desires Marie, came out shortly after on Ed Walters Records based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In summer 2002, after some small tours and numerous local and regional shows, Del Cielo recorded its first full-length entitled 'Wish And Wait' at Inner Ear Studios outside Washington, D.C., with Chad Clark (Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill). The full-length was released April 2003 on Eyeball Records (CD) and Golden Brown/Exotic Fever (LP). In summer of 2003, the band embarked on an extensive six-and-a-half week national tour to support the release of 'Wish And Wait'.

They also released a second split 7"" with the defunct Kill The Man Who Questions, a political punk band from Philadelphia that had since become good friends with Del Cielo. Two years after they released their second full-length, entitled 'Us Vs. Them' on Lovitt Records.

Del Cielo was a self-booked band with a strong interest in community, both in supporting other bands and friends and in playing benefits, rallies, and other gatherings related to social change. They participated in the Empower Program's Girls' Voices Conference for 200 teenage girls, Ladyfest D.C., Ladyfest Philly, Ladyfest South, Pointless Fest in Philadelphia, numerous Take Back The Night and Rock For Choice events, and a host of other festivals. The individual members were also busy: Andolsun played in Dischord Records' Beauty Pill, Lisi contributed solo songs to various benefit projects, and Otto runs Exotic Fever Records.

The band performed and toured with such notable acts as Rainer Maria, Q And Not U, Mates Of State, Against Me!, Decahedron, Kill The Man Who Questions, The Sound Of Failure, Light The Fuse And Run, 1905 and Crispus Attucks. On September 23rd 2005 they played their last show at VCU in Richmond, VA.

Jake used to play a game with the older married ladies in his neighborhood. He’d show up on their doorsteps at 3:00 with a copy of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, a half-finished Gibson, and two silk blindfolds tucked into his sweatbands. By 5:15, washed in the indelible truths of antiquity, the soft glow of Rochester dusk bleeding silently through the drapes, Steely Dan’s Aja purring on cassette -- the two souls, utterly blind and naked on the upstairs carpet, forced each other to learn rythmes of the universe, moment after moment, until the unmistakable creak of the Kodak middleman’s entrance below. Jake whispers: “Don’t flinch, pilgrim.”

Laid off from his job as a NASA janitor, Darrell bought a bass in a short-sighted scheme to advance the zamboni sciences. By early spring of ‘98 this horny genious had come clean twice about his latent desire to grant wishes to the clumsy. His hobbies led him to the prime meridian and three ugly games of Blackjack: the first won him a trailer. The second won him a wife. The third plays endlessly between his softening brain and over-torqued libido.

The estuary fetishist of the group, Murphy grew up in love with snowmobiles and NWA. Fog sat like a translucent pall over the skirt of the White Mountains. Guitars played. Later things changed, he built a valve-state amplifier from mint, thicket, arsenic, elbow-grease and the remnants of a fin-de-ciecle (siecle?) polish telescope. If Icarus watched tv, he would be it.

A benchwarmer with major rushing yards, a luddite with huge schematics, Ben hates epitomies of urbane ambivalence. This 3rd string marching band buggler shook things up in his home town with a self-released cover of The Shagg’s cover of Toto’s “Africa” at the age of 12. During his education in the mid-west he retreated to the comforts afforded by Powerball and cheap Korean guitars -- shunning sunlight, friendship, allegory and the brisk walk -- all in the pursuit of his 4 bands: Bizarre Asthmatics, Royal Nature Shots, The Colonel St. Private’s Precious Void, and Huckleberry Booya.

Upon the release of their last album Philadelphia Weekly described Taggart as “harking back to underground rock’s golden age during the half-decade leading up to Nevermind. The guitars are sweet and crunchy like super sugar crisp, purveying tasty hooks coated in distortion and jagged edges with gruff, half-yelped vocals reminiscent of Eric Bachmann (Archers of Loaf)”. A Philadelphia institution for over 20 years Taggart has never taken a break from writing, performing and recording. Over the years they’ve had the opportunity to open for some of their biggest influences, including Portastatic, Tommy Stinson, and even acted as Grant Hart’s backing band on a few Husker Du songs. They will self-release their latest full length album, L’maskin, on February 23rd, 2018.

A sleepy semi-rural Sonoma County town, 50 miles north of San Francisco, best known for its annual accordion festival. While American indie rock has splintered off into myriad factions and sub-factions, The Rum Diary holds precious the age of noisy rock bands that thrived off of good songwriting and deep melodies. Using a combination of two drum kits, double bass guitar, Farfisa, Moog, layered guitars, soft vocals and a whimsically stunning array of homemade instruments (including the Schuylerphone*, the Electroencephalophone*, and the KotatEbow*) the resulting songs, influenced by such bands as Three Mile Pilot, Mogwai, Dianogah, and good old classic rock, are blasts of sound that are at once experimental, beautiful, and thought provoking.
 
Live, The Rum Diary's creation of an “evocative and eerie” visual sound is enhanced by ephemeral film images projected onstage, ranging from random  movie clips to nature footage. Shows often culminate in an “indie-rock-drum-circle,” described by one show attendee as “a final and energizing punctuation mark where Mckenzie and Fee join the two drummers and, all four with drumsticks in hand, pound an indelible mark into your musical psyche.”  Their live shows range from simple impressionism to abstract madness, like a dream you can't quite remember but can't ever forget."

Line-up:
Tyler Owen - guitars, keys, vocals, random instrumentation (The Bottom Line, Tribal Eye, Loveseat, Grasshopper Takeover, Citrus)

Former musicians:
Peter Rom - guitar
Billy Slater - drums
Dean Butterworth - drums
Jason Kirby - bass
Forrest Sprague - harmonica
Janice Foy - cello
Mike Lesniak - trash can

Perhaps the title of THE EYE's debut album sums up the self-perceived life of frontman Tyler Owen. """"The Joy of Diving"" is both the fear of success and the love of failure,"" Owen says. ""Ultimately, it's about skirting responsibility for your own actions. In my own experience, I've always had something to fall back on, alleviating the necessity of success."" That may be true in his mind, but to the outside observer, nothing could be farther from the truth.

The EYE has been rocking the Far West and West Coast for nearly six years, sharing the stage with heavy-hitters 311, The Samples, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Winebottles and many more. Their mix of poppy yet creative alternative rock has won them fans throughout their local scenes, whether it be in Colorado, California or Nebraska.

A natural born musician, Owen, born and raised in the cornfields of Omaha, NE (not literally, of course), has been playing and producing music since he was thirteen years old. His first band, The Bottom Line, modeled themselves after old-school rockers The Replacements. ""Two of the guys were in the school band,"" Owen recalls. ""On Friday nights in the fall when we had a gig (usually at one of the Catholic girls' schools) the two bandies would be busy performing at our high school's football games. That left our keyboardist and myself the responsiblity of setting up the equipment. Inevitably and invariably, we would instead drink warm beer out of his trunk in the parking lot before the shows...we didn't play a single, sober show until our last gig in high school, as a matter of fact. It's a bit embarrassing.""

In the last seven years, however, Owen has been clear headed enough to record or release nine full-length recordings. Two with Colorado-based Tribal Eye, three with his former band Loveseat (their album, ""Applehands and Yellowcans"" went on to sell approximately 16,000 copies), one solo project (which sold over 6,000 copies), one for fellow Nebraskans Grasshopper Takeover, one for Miltona's own Citrus and his latest project, THE EYE.

In 1995, Owen and bassist Jason Kirby teamed up with guitarist Jesper Andreasson to form the band Loveseat. Eventually they completed the group with drummer Chris Novicki, whom Owen had met while an extra on the set of ""Murder, She Wrote"" (don't ask). Loveseat played the LA club circuit for nearly two years, and released three albums: ""...Day and a Half"", ""Chet's Chicken Shack"" and ""Applehands and Yellowcans"". Citing a need for a ""normal life,"" bassist Kirby left the band in 1998 to enroll in law school in San Diego.

Owen immediately went on to begin work on The Eye's debut release, which had then become his own pseudo-solo project. Bassist Kirby would come up during breaks in law school to track the bass, and friend Dean Butterworth (from Ben Harper's Innocent Criminals) would sit in on drums.

Slated for a March 28th release, ""The Joy of Diving"" is a fascinating blend of traditional alternative-rock. The album includes a somewhat electronic interpretation of The Cure's ""Killing An Arab"" and a straitforward approach to Joy Division's ""Ceremony"". ""People are always asking me why I do covers on my records,"" Owen explains. ""I guess it's my way of paying homage to the bands I idolized growing up. I don't write songs in their style, yet it's fun to add those songs to the overall feel of the record. If I could get away with doing a whole cover record, I would. And someday I might."""

[a=Shirlé Hale] had recently left her bass duties with riot grrrl band [a=Womyn of Destruction]. Her boyfriend, guitarist [a=David Koslowski] had just returned from a two month tour with his group [a=Liquor Bike]. He found a cassette of home recordings that Hale had put together in his absence. Hale was at work when he gave the 6 songs a listen. He was so impressed by the emotional depth of these tracks that he encouraged Hale to call upon their old friend [a=Miyuki Furtado] to play drums. Furtado knew Hale from their days of playing in the band Jag. The newly formed trio would enter the studio in July 1995 to cut some demos. Hale tagged the project Gerty, named for her moped, but also for Hale's love of Gertrude Stein.

[a1935761] quickly signed with Merkin Records and released the [i]Raggedy Aneurysm EP[/i] in the Fall of 1996. Spring of 1997 saw the group releasing their debut full-length, [i]Carload of Scenic Effects[/i], recorded with Drew Mazurek (Jawbox, Texas Is The Reason), which garnered rave reviews. [a1935761] hit the road in support of the record and while touring the Southeast the band made a big decision, they had fallen in love with the easy living and the camaraderie of the Chapel Hill, NC music scene. In the Spring of ’98, the band decided to leave their hometown of Baltimore and move South. One small problem was that drummer Furtado had fallen in love with his new girlfriend (now wife & mother of their beautiful daughter) and wanted to move to NYC for her new job. He would go onto to play bass and sing for the post-punk Brooklyn band [a=The Roger Sisters]. Hale & Koslowski were supportive of Furtado's decision, but opted to move and keep Gerty alive.

After settling in Chapel Hill and then Durham, NC the band recruited drummer [a=Laura King] ([a=Superchunk], [a=Bat Fangs], [a=R. Ring]) & bassist Justin Williams to help them finish their next record, [i]Two Kisses in a Row[/i]. The record was released on Koslowski’s own label, [l734463], in April 1999. The band had a very difficult tour in support of the record and decided to take a break. In May of 2000, Hale & Koslowski solidified their union & married after seven years of living & writing music together. While honeymooning in Europe, Hale & Koslowski decided break up [a1935761] as they had grown tired of band life, touring and plans for their third album weren't forming as they had hoped.

In 2001, Hale & Koslowski started doing some home recording on an 8-Track Tape Machine with Koslowski doing the engineering. This would become the nucleus of the third [a1935761] release, [i]Sweets from the Minibar[/i]. The now-reformed duo contacted producer [a=Chris Stamey] ([a308018], [a=Pylon], [a=Le Tigre]) to help finish up the recordings. This saw the group working with more electronic sounds, drum machines & tape loops while still using organic instrumentation. In Spring 2002, the band signed with the indie label, [l80701], which released the record in September 2002. At this point, [a1935761] had essentially become Hale & Koslowski with a revolving cast of players: [a=Maria Albani] ([a=Schooner], [a=Organos]), Rafi Goldberg, [a=Marc Faris], [a=Chris Eubank] ([a=Shark Quest]), [a=Mitch Easter] ([a256974]) & [a=Jon Wurster] ([a=Superchunk]) to help them record and/or tour.

The duo recorded a Christmas EP with producer [a=Zeno Gill] called [i]Three for the Holiday[/i], which was released on his label, [a256974] in the Winter of 2003. Hale & Koslowski headed back into the studio with Gill to record the follow up record, [i]Dance The Swivel Hips[/i], but unfortunately it never saw the light of day. In 2005, Hale & Koslowski decided to move on from the group after 10 years and finally put [a1935761] to bed. After a short hiatus the duo formed a new shoegazey alternative band called [a=Free Electric State]."

By that time drummer Andy Robillard and violinist Teri Hoefer joined the group. 1998 saw the release of their second album 'Love My Life... Hate My Friends', which quickly gave rise to their popularity amongst the local music scene, which soon followed with their 1999 release 'The Things we Need' EP on the Touch & Go subsidiary Overcoat Recordings. 1999 also gave way to personal changes within the band; Jimmy LaValle temporarily replaced Robillard on drums, while Hoefer left the band permanently, to start a band with her fiance Chris Relyea, formerly of The Rapture, giving way for Ben White to assume the lead guitar role. By the turn of the century, the band went on various national tours, and brought drummer Jay Hough in place of Lavalle (so he could focus on his group The Album Leaf full-time). By this time, GoGoGo Airheart switched to Angel Hair/The VSS vocalist Sonny Kay's record label (GSL), and the band issued their 3rd album, ""Out Every Window The Snap Of Envy And Greed"", in 2000. 2001 saw the band tour the states and work on their next album ""EXITHEUXA"" which was released in June of 2002, when GoGoGo Airheart embarked on a national tour with Liars, and later in the year a European tour, supported by fellow indie rock artists such as Franz Ferdinand and The Futureheads, followed by another national tour on their way back to California with Get Hustle. In 2003 White left the band, and Robillard was invited back to double-drum with Jay, who ended up parting ways with the band in July 2003, stripping the band down to a 3 piece. In 2004 the band recorded demos of new material with Rocket From The Crypt/Pitchfork/Drive Like Jehu founder John Reis, but material from these sessions has yet to be released. By 2005, Ben White was back in the band and the group released their final album, Rats! Sing! Sing! which followed both national and international tours, and in early 2006, the band decided to call quits. Their final show was played at The Casbah on May 22nd, 2006. On their website, Andy Robillard told fans, ""after almost ten years of doing GGGAH we just can't keep living on the cheap ... I'm a little sad but also relieved that the band is done, end of an era and all that, but at least I can say without any reservations whatsoever that we never put out a shitty record, and we never sold out to The Man."""

He is the younger brother of science-fiction author and critic David Langford

Langford was originally the drummer for the punk band The Mekons when it formed at the University of Leeds in 1977, but he later took up the guitar as other band members left. Since the mid-1980s he has been one of the leaders in incorporating folk and country music into punk rock. He has released a number of solo recordings as well as recordings with other bands outside of The Mekons, most notably the Waco Brothers, which he co-founded after moving to Chicago in the early 1990s. He is involved with the Chicago-based independent record label,  Bloodshot.

Langford is also a prolific and respected visual artist best known for his striking portraits of country music icons including Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, and Elvis Presley. His multimedia music/spoken-word/video performance, “The Executioner’s Last Songs,” premiered at Alverno College in 2005, and has been performed in several other cities. He illustrated the comic strip Great Pop Things under the pseudonym Chuck Death. Since 2005 he has co-hosted a weekly radio program, “The Eclectic Company,” broadcast on WXRT 93.1 FM in Chicago. He has contributed to This American Life.

Among Langford’s musical side projects have been the Three Johns (with John Hyatt and John (Phillip) Brennan), who released several albums of drum-machine-fueled punk in the 1980s; the country-punk Waco Brothers (with Dean Schlabowske, Tracey Dear, Alan Doughty, Mark Durante, and Mekons drummer Steve Goulding), who have been recording since 1995; the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, a revolving assortment of Chicago musicians who have backed both Langford and other musicians such as Kelly Hogan; and Ship and Pilot. He became a father figure to the local music scene, encouraging many of his labelmates on Bloodshot Records and championing anyone he thought worthy of scrutiny, often lending his services as a musician or visual artist or inviting local musicians to guest on his releases. Langford’s first official solo album, Skull Orchard, a look back at his hometown of Newport, Wales, was released in 1998. He followed it with All the Fame of Lofty Deeds, in 2004, Gold Brick in 2006, and Old Devils in 2010.

Langford is an accomplished artist and is renowned for his multi-layered paintings of famous and forgotten figures from the dawn of country music. Nashville Radio, a collection of his artwork and writings, was published in 2006.

In January and February 2009, Chicago’s Walkabout Theater Company and Collaboraction premiered a stage adaptation of Langford’s Goldbrick that featured a live band, two actors and video projections. In November and December 2009, The House Theatre of Chicago staged a production of “All the Fame of Lofty Deeds”, written by rock journalist Mark Guarino and based on Langford’s art and 2004 solo album.
Collaborations with other musicians

Langford initiated a project, the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, which performs the music of other country music groups. Several alternative country musicians have guested on these recordings.

Langford has guested on numerous recordings, including with Dutch punk band the Ex, The Old 97s, Chip Taylor, as well as Austin, Texas legend Alejandro Escovedo, and has recorded joint albums with Sally Timms, Kevin Coyne, Richard Buckner, Kat Ex and Rosie Flores."

""The Intima use great instrumental prowess to build a near-constant state of tension in their shadowy, sweeping songs. Their taut structural designs are charged with carefully wielded aggression and barbed wire hooks, sounding experimental while maintaining a melodic accessibility. The tightly knit quartet's emphasis shifts delicately from sparse ethereality to densely juxtaposed clamor and dissonance - built from disjointed guitar, sharp, wavering rhythms, and sawing violin - and tied together by a common thread of comforting intimacy, enormous heart, and intelligence. The Intima are entrenched in the aesthetics of both British post-punk (Mekons, Gang of Four) and American progressive art-punk (Unwound, Sonic Youth), but they hardly sound derivative and their raw impact is as powerful as their primary ancestors."" – Andrew Bottomly, Skyscraper

195322,226821,6887617,US,Lake Trout,Another One Lost,2002,49.48,13,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Alternative Rock', 'Psychedelic Rock', 'Indie Rock']","Lake Trout are a rock band based in Baltimore. Their music is a combination of rock, ambient, jazz, and many other styles, including influences from post-rock and post-punk. The band has released six albums since its inception, four in-studio and two live. Their most recent album entitled ""Live"" was released in December 2008.

Lake Trout consists of:
    * James Griffith, bass, guitar, vocals
    * Ed Harris, guitar, bass, vocals
    * Mike Lowry, drums
    * Matt Pierce, keyboards, saxophone, flute, vocals
    * Woody Ranere, lead vocals and guitar

Lake Trout first came together in 1994. Their first album is self-titled and consists of eight songs with a heavy dose of jazz. It was released independently in 1997. The band's second album, released in 1998, is also on SNS Records. Volume for the Rest of It consists of 16 tracks total and has a more developed feel.

Lake Trout's third album, Alone at Last - Live with DJ Who is a live album and was recorded on December 9, 1999 at Traxx in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was released by Phoenix Rising Records. This album, as would be expected with the addition of a DJ, has a much more electronic sound. It has a slightly darker feel than the previous two records and incorporates elements of drum and bass music into the sound.
With the release of their fourth album, Another One Lost (2003, released by Palm/RX Records), the band made a decided shift towards a more indie rock-oriented sound. The relationship between the ""new sound"" and the ""old sound"" is clearly evident, but the shift is obvious. Some fans lament this change in the band's sound, preferring the more jazz-oriented earlier work. Many enjoy the change, however, seeing a clear progression in the band's sound.

On September 13, 2005, the band released their most recent album, Not Them, You on Palm/RX Records. This album continues with the evolution of the ""new sound.""

In December 2008, the band released a live album containing songs from the groups live set that had not been previously recorded as well as select songs from the most recent two studio albums.

In 1998, they released their first CD with Smells Like Records, Magnetic Anomaly, an album that seems to synthesize the styles of all of their previous releases: each song exploring different aural territories and textures.

Superaquello’s personnel includes singer Patricia Dávila, Jorge Castro on guitar and Pablo Santiago on keyboards and programming. Lately they’ve incorporated live drums and bass guitar, by Eduardo Martínez and Doel Delgado, respectively.

The band has played for international audiences at LAMC (Latin Alternative Music Conference) in New York City and Chicago’s FOCO Festival.

Dykes and Geller were already a couple before working together musically, and in 1999, after she provided vocals for an instrumental track he had written, they started to seriously consider the idea of becoming a band.  Their first release was a split single with [a246272], released by Kindercore in March 2000; Ryan Lewis (the other co-founder of the label) persuaded the couple to play at the South by Southwest music conference that same month to promote the single, even though they had never played live and only had two songs written at the time.

The first IATWTC album, [i][m=199386][/i], was released in mid-2001, but in the wake of the events of September 11, the band received some unexpected attention, due not only to the WTC reference in their name, but also because track 11 on their album was coincidentally named ""September"".  The duo announced that they would be shortening their name to [b]I Am The...[/b], and then released a 2002 single in the UK under the name [b]I Am the World[/b], but eventually returned to their full name for the release of their second album, [i][r=621811][/i].

The two ended their romantic relationship in 2003, but decided to continue the band, and it was during this time that their third album was recorded.  In early 2004, after the album was completed but before its release, Dykes and Geller became a couple again, and embarked on a tour, during which Dykes fell ill and was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system.  The album, [i][m=276020][/i], was released in June 2004, but the duo was mostly unavailable to promote it, due to Dykes' chemotherapy and recovery regimen.  With her cancer in remission, they attempted another tour in 2005, but were forced to end it early when Dykes again had to be hospitalized, this time after contracting pneumonia.  The band was further sidelined when Kindercore became involved in a lawsuit which tied up the label (and Geller) through mid-late 2007.  Although they had planned to record a fourth album, [i]The Cover Up[/i] was ultimately the band's final release."

Their first album, The New Song And Dance, was produced by [a=Tim O'Heir], came out on Gern Blandsten in 2000. Two years later, Radio 4 released their second album, this time produced by the duo known as [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DFA,+The]DFA[/url]. This album was licensed by City Slang for distribution overseas.

From this album came the [r=208761] remix 12"", which set the band in a more club-oriented direction, carrying the already dance-rock sound further into dance realms. Subsequent work has included more club-friendly remixes and further distribution world-wide.

L.A.-based Idaho Falls is named after group leader Raymond Richards' hometown, but their musical oeuvre sounds somewhat Southwestern in origin (from Arizona or New Mexico, perhaps). Richards -- former pedal steel guitarist with Mojave 3 and co-founder of the Sid Hillman Quartet -- plays guitar in this group and shares vocals with the lovely Heather Goldberg, who contributes mandolin on some of their songs. Guitarist Kevin Feyen is a former member of the Black Eyed Peas, while pedal steel guitarist Greg Vincent appeared on the first two albums by Cake. Original upright bass player Jim Brown left the band in spring 2002; his replacement, Dave Koenig, comes from the lineup of several L.A. bands, including the 2002 lineup of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and a California country-rock outfit, the Quarter After. Another local L.A. player, Roger Brogan, (ex-Sunstorm), is the group's drummer. The Idaho Falls' self-titled 2002 debut was a self-released effort.

So you want to know a little bit about The Humbugs. Well here you go. The Humbugs have been playing their brand of pop rock and roll in the Twin Cities for over a decade.  The band is centered on the husband and wife team of Adam and Kristin Marshall. The songs are rooted in classic pop. It’s so difficult to answer the proverbial question, “who do you sound like?” Rather, we’d prefer the listener to make that judgment. However, we will say who we consider some of our biggest influences to be. The list is nearly endless, but would have to include: The Beatles and many other British Invasion groups, The Beach Boys, Elvis Costello, Crowded House, Aimee Mann, Blondie, The Pretenders, Fleetwood Mac, Prefab Sprout.
When Adam and Kristin set out to assemble the band the goal was to find solid musicians that not only shared similar musical sensibilities, but people that all got along, people that could have a good time together. The band honestly is made up of friends that hang out together, laugh at each other, and all dedicate themselves to giving Adam a hard time. This collection of people began with the ultra tight rhythm section of Matt Baccoli and Tim Formanek. Both have been in The Humbugs since the first gig as a five piece in 1999. Mike Senkovich (the new guy and official band vegetarian) has been in the group since 2004 when we convinced (strong-armed) him to share his time between us and his other group, Atomic Flea.
The whole band contributes to arranging the songs and fleshing out Adam’s ideas. We try to create catchy songs that a person could find themselves humming. Our goal is to go beyond typical three chord songs and add that little something that the listener may not hear everyday; something that may catch them slightly off guard but still makes musical sense. Lyrically we try to keep it loose and less narrative so there is enough ambiguity that a person could fit the songs to their own life’s soundtrack. Embracing the notion that the songs belong to the listener.
The band does like to travel and has performed from L.A. to Chicago, to New York City and many places in between. That about does it. Thanks for listening, and we hope you enjoy the tunes as much as we enjoy creating and playing them."

These people are involved in a number of ways, some are dancers, choral singers, horns, orchestral instruments, visual artists (electro and organic). Each performance takes on a life of its own keeping its form nonetheless because the core group remains stable. There is a good deal of improvisation but also well orchestrated planned ideas and great songs of newness.

DORKESTRA
Sometimes dufus will play with a number of orchestral instruments including violin, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, saxophone, tuba, piano, flute, oboe, bassoon, percussion, etc.

DOOFAMILY
The Doofamily is made up of previous members of the band and others who are at times invited to be a part of the shows.

145833,1430406,448245,US,Human Drama,Cause & Effect,2002,62.33,13,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Goth Rock', 'Pop Rock']","One of the longest-lived American goth-inspired bands, Human Drama is in many ways the vehicle for singer/multi-instrumentalist Johnny Indovina, who has overseen the band through a variety of lineup changes and stylistic experiments. Over time he has led Human Drama through a series of inspired releases, his strong, just tender enough singing and ear for darkly passionate and dramatic music always at the core of whatever the band is trying next. Supported by a small but devoted fan base in America and elsewhere, notably in Mexico, both Indovina and Human Drama look set to continue their work for some time to come.
Human Drama's proper first came to wider attention via the heavily-hyped ""Scream scene"" of the mid-'80s, referring to the noted underground goth metal club that helped bring Guns N' Roses and Jane's Addiction to wider attention. Human Drama contributed a song, ""Wave of Darkness,"" to the 1987 collection Scream: The Compilation, which led to a major label deal shortly thereafter with RCA. 1989 saw the release of a taster EP, Hopes Prayers Dreams Heart Soul Mind Love Life Death, and later that year a full album, Feel, both products of recording sessions in Wales and both accomplished enough but rather strident and overbearing. Indovina concluded after release that RCA wasn't doing enough in terms of promotion, making a leap to the small but worthy Triple X label, where he has stayed ever since.
The next major Human Drama release was a masterwork and still for many the best effort by the band still, 1992's The World Inside, a lengthy and, unlike Feel, much more focused and tender effort that deserved the heavy acclaim it won. A solo performance of various cover songs by Indovina at the album's release party inadvertently suggested the next Human Drama album — 1993's Pin-Ups, an open tribute to David Bowie's album of the same name, being a collection of remakes of various sources of inspiration. A move to New York City accompanied a temporary co-release stint on the noted Projekt label, resulting in two further mid-decade releases — 1994's self-titled EP, especially noted for its reworking of Feel's epic ""The Waking Hour,"" and 1995's Songs of Betrayal, an extended meditation on the theme that was later re-released as two separate discs with extra tracks.

Born on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, as Roberta Joan Anderson. In June 1965, she married [a3568909] and she kept his name when they divorced early in 1967, upon which she left for New York City and its folk music scene. (She had already begun singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then Toronto.) In New York, she quickly achieved fame first as a songwriter (e.g. with Chelsea Morning, Both Sides Now or Woodstock) and then as a singer in her own right. After David Crosby had discovered her playing in Florida, he introduced her to his folk rock friends in Los Angeles and its Laurel Canyon scene, where Mitchell will find a home. Early 1968 she is recording her debut LP for Reprise in Hollywood, and by the time of her third album she has her first gold album. Mitchell rose above the folk idiom and had pop hits such as Big Yellow Taxi (1970), Free Man In Paris and Help Me, the last two from 1974's best-selling Court And Spark.

Mitchell's distinctive harmonic guitar style, and piano arrangements all grew more complex through the 1970s as she was deeply influenced by jazz, melding it with pop, folk and rock on experimental albums like 1976's Hejira. She worked closely with jazz greats including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and on a 1979 record released after his death, Charles Mingus. From the 1980s on, Mitchell reduced her recording and touring schedule but turned again toward pop, making greater use of synthesizers and direct political protest in her lyrics, which often tackled social and environmental themes alongside romantic and emotional ones.

Mitchell is also a visual artist. She created the artwork for each of her albums, and in 2000 described herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance."" Mitchell stopped recording over the last several years, focusing more attention on painting, but in 2007 she released Shine, her first album of new songs in 9 years.

In 2020, Mitchell started [l1930164], a series of releases containing previously unreleased material from her personal vaults, along with box sets of the studio albums.

She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer) in 1997. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, was voted #30 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list of 2003.

As a long-time [a785749]'s collaborator, Beltrami scored seven of his films, including the [i]Scream[/i] franchise. He also repeatedly worked with other notable international filmmakers, including [a3250701], [a2959576], [a1592128], and [a1562555].

Beltrami graduated from [l290701] and further studied at [l744815]. After relocating to Los Angeles, Marco continued his formal education at [l2584201] under [a208267]. The composer debuted in the mid-90s and reached a mainstream breakthrough by 1996 when he composed music for Wes Craven's iconic slasher [i]Scream[/i]. He soon became a sought-after composer in horror/thriller and action genres, writing music for del Toro's [i]Mimic[/i] (1997) and the '98 cult classic [i]The Faculty[/i] directed by [a65543].

Among the notable Beltrami's 2000s contributions are his collaboration with [a392594] on the soundtrack for [a10591390]'s [i]Resident Evil[/i] (2002), del Toro's [i]Hellboy[/i], and [i]I, Robot[/i] by Proyas in 2004.

After the recruitment of drummer [a=John Lever] of [a=The Politicians (6)], their first single ""In Shreds"" on CBS, made number 42 on John Peel's Festive Fifty in 1982. They originally signed with CBS, but they disagreed with how they should sound. CBS dropped them after the one single, despite encouraging sales. They soon signed with Statik. However, Statik was distributed by Virgin, so they couldn't qualify for the independent charts and were thus overlooked by the music press.
The debut album, ""Script of the Bridge"", was recorded in Rochdale during a six-week period. The band was really pissed when they found out about the reduced version which was released by MCA in the US. They then became unhappy with Statik and tried to get away from them, but were bound by contractual obligations. After their second album, ""What Does Anything Mean? Basically"", they signed with Geffen. While signed to Geffen, the band released what was to be their last album together for fifteen years, ""Strange Times"" as the band literally fell apart, acrimoniously, with grief after the 1987 sudden death of band manager Tony Fletcher.
The year 2000 saw an end to the 'hostilities' and a reforming of the group; and a new 'unplugged' album entitled 'Strip' and other live releases followed.

John Lever passed away in 2017 and Dave left the band afterwards leaving Mark and Reg as the only two original members. The Chameleons continue to perform as of 2024.

Vocalist Tim Mitchell's  and drummer Ben Montesano have been at the helm of the project since 1995, back when it was called Goldenrod. Bassist Greg Bertens (also a member of Film School) was a part of the group then too, but left for a couple of years as the band struggled to find a coherent sound.

By 1998 Mitchell and Montesano were playing and recording together as Pink, and recorded a well-received three-song demo. Soon after the demo was completed, Bertens returned and Andrew Simas signed on to handle keyboards and sampler. Simas stuck around for only a few months before Tad Ro was brought in to replace him, adding a second guitar and piano to the mix. It was then that Pink became Pinq and began to move in an increasingly nuanced, spacey, phantasmagorical direction. 


In 2000, [a1333872]'s Kurt Hobson and [a2229872]'s Mike Alexis completed Pinq's rhythm section and grouped together for the bands first bona fide album, the self-released eight-song album Quiet Games for Hot Weather.

Quiet Games is a lofty, heavy debut, submerged in swirling whirlpools of guitar, whispery vocals, and emotionally resonant melodies. Upon release of the album, Pinq went on tour, and played a lot locally in San Francisco.

In 2002 the band, following a change of line up,decided to reform as [a904217]. "

One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.

Over time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.

Following a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).

Now, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band). The album's eight tracks were winnowed down from thirty, and it shows: each song is memorable and unique, all speaking in THE ALBUM LEAF's singular voice while expressing themselves through a wide variety of different sounds and emotions.

The band's thorough, unified approach is evident on nearly every aspect of Between Waves: the album displays multifaceted, meticulous sound design, a keen ear for balancing disparate influences, and the strongest senses of dynamics, rhythm, and composition THE ALBUM LEAF has displayed to date. From the moody evolution of ""Glimmering Lights"" to the wistful hip-hop stylings of ""A New Soul"" and beyond, Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF at its most inventive, most confident, and most impressive."

Formed in Bloomington, Indiana in the February of 1994 after Chris Carothers (guitar) and Rory Leitch (drums) met at Indiana University. They began playing basement shows and continued their search for a bass player. A few bassists drifted in and out, but nothing seemed to fit the evolving formula. The following autumn of 1994, a mutual friend introduced the duo to guitarist Dan Burton, who had just started school. Dan grew up near Louisville, KY and shared a similar affinity for some of the local bands. At the time, Chris and Rory weren't necessarily looking for another guitarist, but of Dan's playing served as a catalyst for their chemestry; he was perfect for the band.

From that point on, the three started playing shows in the area. Around this time, Ativin played a basement party with the band Braid, and guitarist Bob Nanna invited Ativin to appear on his up coming compilation record, ""Ooh Do I Love You"". Ativin contributed the track ""Slovenia"" along with Bloomington rock lords, Slavic 747. The three continued practicing and writing songs with the hopes of putting out a record of some kind. Ativin recorded a demo tape at Chris' house, and started shopping it around to any label that might be remotely interested. Matt who ran Polyvinyl Records Co. label liked the demo and offered to put out a record. The name of the band would be Ativin. The band contacted Steve Albini about recording the record. After a bit of correspondence, a date was set to record their first EP in the basement of Steve's house in Evanston, IL. Ativin recorded and mixed four songs in one day during the month of March, 1995. The three returned home content with these songs, but they still had one that wasn't quite finished during the Albini session. Ativin finished the song soon after and the track ""Meditational Flaws"" was recorded by long time friend, Carl Saff in the basement of Rory's house. The record was dubbed ""Pills Versus Planes"" by comrades, Slavic 747.

Ativin and the Slavs formed a close bond and the two played together around the Mid West through everything from tornados to burning cars the next year or so. During this time, Ativin joined forces with the then forming, Secretly Canadian Records,local Bloomington record label. Ativin recorded the ""Modern Gang Reader / Larkin"" 7"" single in November of 1996, and released it through them. That summer, the band toured the Eastern half of the States with their good friends Roadside Monument (who were kind enough to invite them along). The next record was brewing and Ativin decided to record with Andy Bryant after they heard the Skinner Pilot record he recorded at Idful Studios in Chicago. ""German Water"" was recorded during the month of October, 1997 at Kingsize Sound Laboratories, in Chicago. The band wanted to make a record that focused less on intense song dynamics and volume, and more on fluidity and various types of instrumentation between the three. Dan had been making recordings at home of manipulated guitar sounds and field recordings which were used throughout the record. The next month, the band came back to Chicago to mix the record at Uber Studios with Andy Bryant.

Ativin had been fans of the Chicago band Dianogah for quite some time and formed a friendship with the members. Ativin was eqaully enthusiastic about the silkscreening that printer Jay Ryan, Dainogah's bassist, created. Ryan contributed the artwork for German Water which was released February of 1998, simulatanusly, the band was planning their next recording. They decided to do another session with Steve Albini his new studio in Chicago. ""Summing the Approach"" was captured in the B room of Electrical Audio during the 29th and 30th of March of 1998. This record hinged more on angular rhythms and off-kilter sound orchestration than did ""German Water"". Ativin shed many of the layers of instrumentation on this recording; using only guitars, drums, and manipulated tape samples. Chris and Matt Clark of Pinebender collaborated their artistic efforts and produced the dark visual element to round out the album's eerie feel. During the next few months, Ativin continued to play as many shows as possible and contributed a number of songs to some friends (""Zum Audio Vol. 2"", ""Regeneration"", and ""How to be a Hero"") who were releasing compilation records at the time. The following June provided another opportunity to tour the Eastern half of the U.S. A three week tour ensued, and the three had a successful tour travel and met up with more like minded people along the way. Ativin returned home and took a bit of a hiatus while the members shifted focus to other projects. Chris decided to head North to Chicago for work. Rory and Dan stayed in Bloomington and continued to play in their other band, Early Day Miners with Joe Brumley, Kenny Childers and Pete Skafish. Dan also was working towards completing his degree in Audio Engineering at I.U., and continued to record bands such as: the Panoply Academy Core of Engineers, Dave Fischoff, Loren Mazzacane Conners and Songs:Ohia for Secretly Canadian. Unfortunately, the geography between the members began to take its toll, and over the course of a few months the band broke up. Ativin played a final show at the Fireside Bowl on August 14, 1999 with their brother's band from Portland, SPECTATOR PUMp.

Over the course of the next few years, Dan and Rory continued to play in Early Day Miners while Chris played speradically in different projects (including the the band Martinsville with fellow Slavic 747 members in Los Angeles).

The long stretch of time apart prompted Dan and Chris to discuss reforming the band. During Spring of 2001 Dan and Chris decided to record a new Ativin record. Rory was not able to play, so the two recruited long time friend Kevin Dunaman of ChiselDrillHammer to play drums (as well as various guest appearances). The new Ativin record will hopefully be relesed by Fall, 2001 on Secretly Canadian Records. ""Interiors"" was released in January 2002 to critical acclaim.

In November 2002 drummer Kevin Duneman was replaced by Joey Ficken (The Swords Project), with whom the band started the first recording session for the next album in February 2003 in Porland, Oregon with engineer Evan Railton. Soon Joey Ficken was replaced by Mark Rice (John Wilkes Booze), leading to the next recording session in June 2003 in Chicago at Electrical Audio with Greg Norman. The band's friends Jonathon Ford (Unwed Sailor/Roadside Monument) and Jef Brown (Jackie-O Motherfucker) play bass and sax respectively on a couple of songs. Album titled ""Night Mute"" (tentatively titled ""Birds"") was released in March 2004 - and the band split soon afterwards.

In late 2014 Ativin reformed, starting rehearsing in December 2014, preparing for the upcoming short tour in early 2015. The line-up was the following: Dan Burton on guitar and vocals, Chris Carothers on guitar, Mark Rice on drums and Jonathan Ford on bass. Soon after that 2015 tour the band dissolved again.

In June 2021 Chris Carothers and Dan Burton reformed Ativin again, joined by Chris Brokaw (Codeine, Come, etc) on drums in August. In December 2021 Ativin finished main recording session for their new album ""Austere"" in Chicago at Electrical Audio with Steve Albini - to be released in 2023 by Joyful Noise Recordings. First single from the album, ""Mountain Visions"", was recorded featuring guest vocals of Natasha Noramly (Ganger) and released on March 23, 2023.

They combine intense, complex hard rock with undeniable melody—the likes of which is difficult to categorize or draw comparisons to—and push both equally to the fore; they've ignored the prerecorded tracks and dancer battalions and instead connect with their audience through sweaty, passionate, uplifting live shows; they reach deep within their collective soul and extract poetry that resonates with a wide variety of hearers on multiple levels. And best of all, they haven't bought into the prevailing myth that rock 'n' roll is dead.


Matt, the main lyricist and singer, is blessed with an ancient, bottomless soul, one with room enough to nurture oceans of emotion—as well as two distinct personalities. Onstage, Matt (like his brother Christian) moves like an overloaded live wire. Offstage, though, he powers down to a crawl, adorns his psyche with an enigmatic shell, and is highly reluctant to discuss his lyrics—and definitely not the stories that inspired them.


""My lyrics reflect whatever I'm going through at that time,"" Matt says in quiet, carefully measured phrases. ""A lot of them deal with loss, with soul searching. It's not the prettier stuff, but it's real—and that's why I can't tie things up with a neat, little bow at the end. There's too much distress for that… too much of me not knowing where to go or what to do or what to think.""


Christian shares Matt's artistic tendencies, counting Matisse and other impressionists as major inspirations (as well as William Shakespeare and Robert Frost). Musically, he's off the chart. A classically trained guitarist and fan of Romantic-period orchestral pieces, Christian habitually cranks up his practice amp and effortlessly forms a blurry progression of impossible, indecipherable barre chords, his right hand often stretching across five frets into jazz-fusion concoctions—all intricate, delicate, precise, and potent.


Chris McCurdy is the third and final link in Brooklyn Run's perfect circle, matching the Gillette's razor-sharp musicianship with some impressive percussion chops of his own. Most often you'll find McCurdy tightly wound behind the drum kit, gritting his teeth in a sneer, and unleashing angry slaps on the snare.


As it turns out, it was in McCurdy's way-too-crowded garage that Brooklyn Run first got together in the spring of 2000, shuffling off years and years of memories filled with Pearl Jam cover band gigs and a last gasp at punk rock fame. Instead they situated themselves in a triangle—McCurdy's drums wedged deep into the sides of cardboard boxes—and Brooklyn Run was born. It was in this humble space that Matt, Christian, and Chris invented a brand-new, aggressive-but-pretty sound, fueled by their individual desires to be true to their musical selves, as well as a mutual mission to reach as many listeners as possible.


Little did the guys in Brooklyn Run know that their future Record label, LMC Records, was thinking along the same trailblazing lines.


""I listened to them play in that garage, and their sound was like nothing else I've ever heard,"" Lee Chestnut, president of LMC recalls. ""They were boiling over in intensity. There was so much musical expression in that place. And I was really impressed with how hard they were working on their sound, on writing songs. They were accomplishing incredible things. I realized these guys were serious.""


""We had no idea Lee was going to say that,"" Christian recalls with an incredulous chuckle. ""Our jaws just dropped. I mean, one day we're in the garage, the next day we're in a recording studio making a demo and talking about a full-length album.""


""We want to take everything as far as it can go,"" Christian says with certain resolve. ""We've been ready for a long time."""

While DeRosa is the sole permanent member, Aarktica has featured a number of musicians and collaborators throughout the project’s lifespan. Aarktica is known for using guitars – along with mostly organic instruments like brass, strings, harmoniums, and voices on some albums – to create its unique textural sound. 

Jon Pareles, NY Times: “Aarktica's songs are extended reveries, built on loops of guitars and drums and occasional voices. The musical elements hover and circle, float by or bristle with distortion as the songs drift through serenity and trouble.”

As the origin story goes, after going deaf in his right ear, DeRosa began recording audio experiments as a way to interpret sound as he now experienced it. These early audio endeavors, recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder, developed into what would become the first Aarktica album “No Solace In Sleep” (Silber Records, 1999). 

It was also around this time that DeRosa began studying with minimalist pioneer La Monte Young. These studies would greatly influence all of DeRosa’s music in the years to follow. 

Aarktica’s sonically diverse audio explorations span decades, straddling the lines of shoegaze and ambient, jazz and drone, electro-pop and post-rock. Aarktica's 2022 album ""We Will Find The Light"" is now out on Darla Records. Their latest ""Paeans"" is available now on Projekt Records.

The two hit it off and soon found themselves immersed in the California drum ‘n’ bass scene, remixing songs and creating their own extended dance tracks for Lum’s DJ sets.

After a series of jazzy dance singles released on comps alongside the likes of LTJ Bukem and Jaffa, Lovespirals changed directions to explore more guitar-and-lyric-based music with their debut CD, 'Windblown Kiss,' released mid-2002 by [l=Projekt]. The duo followed up in 2005 with 'Free & Easy,' released on their own label, [l=Chillcuts]. 2005 also saw the launch of the band's Chillin' with Lovespirals podcast. In 2007, their 3rd album, 'Long Way From Home,' and the 'Motherless Child EP' were co-released by reapandsow, Inc. and Chillcuts. 2008 and 2009 saw the release of two remix collections of ""This Truth,"" by Chillcuts and [l=Loverush Digital], respectively. With radio and club support from Armin van Buuren, Denny Dowd, The PH Factor and others, the 'Damien S And Love Spirals Feat Anji Bee' set of ""This Truth"" mixes did well in dance music charts, hitting #2 in World Trance, #4 in World House and #10 in World Commercial on the DMC, as well as making the #8 spot on Music Week’s Upfront Club Chart. 2010 brought the release of the band’s 4th full-length album, 'Future Past,' the 'Love EP,' and a video for the song ""Home"" - the band's first. In 2010 Lovespirals also released their previously unavailable 'Ecstatic EP' from 2001, as well as their 2005 remix set, 'Walk Away EP,' in digital format. After a brief hiatus to record and release music under the vocalist's artist name, Anji Bee, and to launch a new career on YouTube as Happy Healthy Vegan, Lovespirals released 2 digital-only singles with attendant music videos (""Brother Against Brother"" and ""Heartstrings""), finally releasing their 5th full-length album, 'Life Goes On,' in late 2018.

Lovespirals’ music has appeared on TV and cable programs including Oprah, Martha, What Perez Sez, Mind of Mencia, Gastineau Girls, and many other shows on stations including MTV, VH1, E!, Playboy, Logo, and Current TV.

342309,195689,471970,Sweden,Acid House Kings,Mondays Are Like Tuesdays And Tuesdays Are Like Wednesdays,2002,35.08,12,['Album'],"['Rock', 'Pop']","['Indie Rock', 'Indie Pop']","Sweden’s no.1 pop band, Acid House Kings, was formed in 1991 by brothers Niklas and Johan Angergård and Joakim Ödlund. With immaculate taste in music stemming from a childhood of Elvis Presley, an almost complete set of Sarah singles and a 100% complete set of the Smiths singles, the Kings set out to define pop music.

Between 1992 and 2002, inspired by the 10 albums in 10 years from Felt, Acid House Kings released a trilogy of albums with one album released every fifth year. The first, “Pop, look & listen!” (1992) is maybe best left unmentioned. The Kings rate it 2.4 out of 5. On the second, “Advantage Acid House Kings” (1997), the aim was to make a Smiths-for-very-sunny-days sort of album. This sort of succeeded, and the Kings rate it 3.8 out of 5.

In 2001, the Kings built their own, now famous, Summersound Studios. Here, Acid House Kings could spend endless amounts of time to create the more sophisticated third album “Mondays are like Tuesdays and Tuesdays are like Wednesdays” (2002). Former guest vocalist and present sister-in-law Julia Lannerheim was introduced as a full-time member while Joakim Ödlund never showed up for recordings. It’s an easy, breezy, beautiful album and the kings rate it 4.2 out of 5.

Spurred by the quality of “Mondays…”, Acid House Kings set out to break their own five years between albums record, while still yet again refining the meaning of pop music. The fourth album, “Sing along with Acid House Kings” (2005), is to date the crown jewel in the Acid House Kings catalogue and a should-have-been-in-the-Guinness-World-Records-book since it included a karaoke-DVD (yes, a karaoke-DVD) with the first 2000 copies. The press release stated untrendy is the new trend, while the music showed an unusual combination of sophistication and catchiness. The Kings rate the album 4.4 out of 5.

In the spring of 2011 Sweden’s pop perfectionists no. 1 finally returned with the new album “Music Sounds Better with You”. The band first started the recording the album in the year 2008, but after three months and with more than half the album finished they decided to scrap it. Reason? They weren’t completely sure they would top their previous album and considered the songs too dark and not melodic enough for The Kings.

In the beginning of 2010 Acid House Kings returned with new inspiration, a brighter mood and numerous new songs. According to the band the new album is “Music Sounds Better with You”. It also got castanets on every single song. -“Music Sounds Better with You” will not re-define pop music, but it may very well define it, states Julia Lannerheim"

They released four CDs.
Visual artist Fisher had co-founded The Hissyfits while attending Pratt Institute in 1996, but left that band in 1999. The Color Guard’s first lineup—with Valerie Massimi on lead guitar and Chris Lee on drums—recorded a self-titled debut CD-EP with engineer Louie Lino in 2000, and Fisher created unique handmade packaging for each copy.
Their second release was the full-length album [i]Speech for Heated Hearts[/i] in 2002, recorded by Hillary Johnson. For this CD, Nina57 played lead guitar and opera-trained Jake Alrich played drums and sang harmonies along with Gilliland. The album received a highlighted ""Listen 2 This"" recommended review in [i]Entertainment Weekly,[/i] and four stars from Allmusic.com.
The band recorded their second full-length with Louie Lino in 2004 and titled it [i]Dark Pop.[/i] Josh Zisman served as lead guitarist, and the album featured the talents of three different drummers: Caryn Havlik, Norie Manigault, and Jake Alrich. The band considers [i]Dark Pop[/i] its most masterful release.
[i]Cornucopia[/i] was The Color Guard’s final farewell release in 2007; they recorded it at NYU with additional tracking at Zisman’s home studio. Joe Salvati played drums on the six-song EP, which was paired with a performance DVD documenting a show at CBGB 313."

When he was 10, his family moved from the warm California sun to the Bad Bad Lands of Australia. Lennon-McCartney melodies and Brian Wilson harmonies were supplanted by wobble boards and tuneless flamin’ jungle music.

Eventually, the need for guitars brought the young Bruce back to America. Specifically, to Phoenix, and the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery. (It’s not a religious term — it translates roughly as, “wooden-stringed-instrument-building.”)

In the '80s, Grand Junction, Colorado was not normally considered one of the hotbeds of new wave rock, but it was — it's just that nobody ever heard the music that came out of there. Nevertheless, Shoblit and the Bush Pilots were two bands which were at the forefront of the G.J. new wave scene, and Gordon was a key figure in both bands. It is undisputable that songs like ""Solitary Confinement"", ""Cans and Bottles"", ""Another Good Year"" and ""Alienate Yourself"" have influenced countless artists ever since. That is to say, all those artists could never be counted.

Gordon returned to Southern California in the late '80s and formed the Cyphers, a pop/rock/demolition foursome which cut a swath of broken guitar strings and splintered harmonies across the L.A. music scene. It was during this time that Bruce wrote the score to the beloved cult film, SHOCK! SHOCK! SHOCK! (Rhino Home Video).

Gordon has resurfaced in the new millennium as the writer and co-producer of the new album by Mr. Encrypto, HERO AND VILLAIN! (In fact, some claim Mr. Encrypto and Gordon are one and the same! Of course, if this were true, it would mean Gordon played every instrument and sang every vocal on the album. Surely, this stretches plausibility to the breaking point!)"

Since 2018 there have been two versions of the band, one with classic members [a=Tracii Guns] and [a=Phil Lewis] and one with classic members [a=Steve Riley] and [a=Kelly Nickels]. In 2021, the incarnation with Riley and Nickels finally changed its name to [a=Riley's L.A. Guns] because of a lawsuit concerning the use of the band name.

L.A. Guns is an American rock band whose music is frequently associated with the L.A. glam metal scene which grew up around the Sunset Strip in the 1980s, in particular the sleaze rock subgenre. Guns N' Roses, which once featured three of the original L.A. Guns members, was the most prominent exponent of this subgenre, generally preferring an anti-social image to elaborate make-up and costumes. 

L.A. Guns was formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner.  Over the next couple years it would evolve into what became the original version of [a=Guns n' Roses].  Tracii Guns would depart that band in 1985 and launch a new version of L.A. Guns.  Throughout the years, a large number of musicians would pass through some version of the band (of which, at times, there have been two) and no single member would be consistently present at all times.  The band's longest-serving and best-known members are Tracii Guns, drummer Steve Riley (who joined the band in 1987 and is the closest thing to a constant member, having been in the band from 1987 until 1992, and again from 1994 until 2016), and vocalist Phil Lewis.  The L.A. Guns name is owned by both Tracii Guns and Steve Riley and both musicians have led their own versions of the band. Riley and Lewis led L.A. Guns from 1999 until 2016 while Guns had a second version of the band from 2006 to 2012.  In 2016, Lewis and Guns formed a new version of the band, while in 2018 Riley announced he had his own version which included one-time bassist Kelly Nickels.  In 2020, Lewis and Guns filed a lawsuit against Riley over the trademark to the L.A. Guns name after which a settlement was reached in which Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis would retained ownership of the L.A. Guns name while Steve Riley would use the name ""Riley's L.A. Guns"".

With this lineup, Brass Kitten successfully released their first album, “EZ-N-Pretty” via Emerald Records. After Kiar’s departure from the band in 1990, Kellie Roulette joined. BK toured “EZ-N-Pretty”, winning ‘National Pick Hit of the Week’ on Z-Rock National Syndicate radio.

In 1992, Brass Kitten had just finished recording the tracks for “Across America” when bassist Kellie was in a serious motorcycle accident. Kiar filled in for Kellie, but his recovery was doubtful and Brass Kitten disbanded. Through time, Kellie has made a full recovery and now plays with Sid in Tuff 2000 out of L.A. Steve lives in Minneapolis and currently plays in Kanine Zowie, while John and Kiar live in Green Bay and have a band called Ugly Stick."

Eventually, they adopted a more lightweight alternative rock and hard rock direction. They gradually became more lightweight with each release after their 1998 debut ""Embrace The Eternal"". Their ""1993-1996"" compilation includes their early brutal death metal demos, with Halo Of Winter being the last of the band’s heavier material that was featured on This Is Solid State Vol. 1."

The band was formed in 1984 by Guitarist Robert Sarzo, and Bassist Tony Cavazo. Cavazo, former Quiet Riot and Snow bassist, was introduced to Sarzo by the late Quiet Riot frontman, Kevin DuBrow in the early 80ʼs. DuBrow suggested they put a band together and they did just that. Cavazo and Sarzo being the siblings of the classic Quiet Riot lineup guitarist and bassist Carlos Cavazo and Rudy Sarzo, decided to create a monster.
They recruited singer Kelly Hansen and drummer Jay Schellen and hit the ground running. With little label interest, the band decided to release a mini-album themselves, Take What You Want. The album and constant touring led to them getting a major label deal. In 1986 & 1987 they opened for Christian metal band Stryper on their To Hell with the Devil album tour. They were soon signed to Enigma Records, the same label as Stryper.
In 1988, the band released their major label debut album, Over the Edge. In 1989, Sarzo left the group and was replaced by ex-Lion guitarist, Doug Aldrich. This lineup recorded the album Slave to the Thrill, which was released in 1990. In 1991 Schellen wrote, recorded and toured extensively with both Unruly Child and Sircle of Silence while Hansen did a considerable amount of session work. Schellen suggested that Hansen help with the recording of Unruly Child’s second release, and shortly after they agreed to resurrect Hurricane. In 2010, Robert Sarzo and Tony Cavazo, founding members, reunited and recruited singer Andrew Freeman and drummer Mike Hansen."

The band formed in 1968.

Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

There has been a Deep Purple band in existence since the late 60s, apart from the eight years between 1976 when Mark IV split up and 1984 when Mark II reformed.

In 1987 the group recorded their first album, Assmaster, released on the New Jersey based punk label Buy Our Records. The cover art was executed by Marvel Comics artists Pat Redding and Pete Ciccone, and Raging Slab began to tour across the United States. In 1988 Steinman and Strzempka decide to add a third guitarist, Mark Middleton, and the group released their second album, True Death.

By 1989 several major labels were bidding to sign Raging Slab, and ultimately it was RCA Records that attracted the band to sign a multi-record contract. The group recorded their eponymous third album Raging Slab, produced by Daniel Rey (Iggy Pop, The Ramones, Masters of Reality). 

The band reentered the studio to record their third RCA record Freeburden with producer Michael Beinhorn (Soundgarden, Ozzy Osbourne, Chili Peppers) and during recording, and the group were utilizing the talents of Chili Pepper and Pearl Jam drummer, Jack Irons.[1] Once again their work is rejected by RCA. Def American impresario Rick Rubin began to make offers to the group to leave RCA and make records for his flourishing label. The group agreed and Rubin bought out the remainder of their contract with RCA.

In 1993 the band released their Def American debut, the magnum opus double album Dynamite Monster Boogie Concert. A video that the group creates to accompany this release featured former child actor Gary Coleman, and the video debuted on MTV's popular Beavis and Butt-Head program, where Beavis is heard to declare, ""they're like Skynyrd, but cool…"".

The following year the band embarked on a European tour in support of Texas.[1] They also played with Lenny Kravitz and Monster Magnet, but while in England the group's then-drummer Paul Sheehan suffered debilitating knee injuries and the group curtailed its touring schedule.[1] They returned to the U.S. and began recording their second Def American (by now known as American Recordings) album. The group delivered Black Belt in Boogie, but the record is rejected by Rubin,[1] who reportedly tells the group that he ""didn't hear any songs"" on it, and it is not released. It was during this time that third guitarist Mark Middleton chose to leave the band, citing ""personal problems"" as the reason for his departure.

The group returned to the studio to record its next album Sing Monkey, Sing!, which was released with very little publicity. American Recordings then severed its relationship with its distributor Warner Bros. Records, but neglected to tell the members of Raging Slab that it had done so, and also overlooked the legalities of releasing the group from its contract. Sing Monkey, Sing! is then sold to the Colombia Record and Tape Club, and the band began legal proceedings against their former label. Deciding that formal proceedings against such a powerful adversary would result only in their own financial ruin, the group decided to wait out the remainder of their contract, which effectively barred them from releasing any new music until the year 2000.

With the passing of the year 2000, the group's contractual restrictions finally fell away and they began to again record and release music, and they appear on compilation albums.

In 2001 the group returned with a renewed vigor and they released The Dealer on NYC based independent label Tee Pee Records, and this was the first album of new and original music released by the band in almost six years. The group toured the U.S. and Canada extensively at this time, and were preparing to embark on a European tour. Scheduled to depart New York City bound for London, England on September 11, 2001, the infamous atrocity that occurred on that date postponed the European leg of their tour until later in 2001. On their return to the US the group once again headed into their studio to begin a new record. This album entitled Pronounced: Eat Shit was released in 2002, also on Tee Pee Records.

After the release and European tour for Pronounced: Eat Shit, the band took a long hiatus, before announcing that longtime bassist Alec Morton was suffering from congestive heart failure. Slab frontman Greg Strzempka joined Swedish southern-metallers Backdraft in 2003, before changing the band name to Odin Grange. But in the year 2004, drummer Niklas Matsson and bassist Mats Rydström joined Raging Slab for a short tour of the US and the recording of a new record, to be announced in 2009.

Full of spit and swagger -- and a ""dirty"" sense of humor to boot -- Jackyl quickly earned a deal with Geffen Records. Jackyl's live shows were already legendary before the ink dried on the Geffen contract.
The 1992 self-titled debut album went platinum and featured notable rock radio hits like ""Down On Me,"" ""When Will It Rain,"" ""I Stand Alone"" and, most notably, ""The Lumberjack,"" during which vocalist Jesse James Dupree performed a chain-saw solo. Dupree's chain-saw escapades on album and in concert became one of many Jackyl trademarks. With the release of 'Jackyl' hit the road and barely left it since. Just long enough to record new albums.
The band earned two Guinness Book of World Records citations and the designation ""The Hardest Working Band in Rock 'N' Roll"" for performing 100 shows in 50 days as well as 21 shows in 24 hours. Dupree says the most grueling of the two was 21 shows in 24 hours; Jackyl completed that task in Texas, and the shows were all done with full lights and sound.

Many of their songs are about sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock & roll. Their musical style mixes hard rock, punk rock, Southern metal and psychobilly. Much of their music is not what would be considered traditionally ""radio friendly"", due to their frequent use of expletives and vulgar terminology. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to ""Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"" on the Double Live Gonzo album.

The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced ""Rider Sighs""), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) left after the album High as Hell, to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band C'mon) for the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some.

The global breakthrough arrived when German guitarist, Michael Schenker, joined the fold in 1973, having left his band Scorpions to follow an offer by Phil Mogg and Pete Way.
The band underwent numerous line-up changes, and to everyone's surprise, autumn 1993 saw the return of the former UFO line-up consisting of Mogg, Way, Schenker, Parker and Raymond. However, Schenker left UFO during the Walk On Water tour again to continue working with his own group, MSG. Phil Mogg and Andy Parker were still members of UFO by 2019, when the band began what they called a farewell tour. Mogg's health issues resulted in UFO cancelling what was planned to be one last tour in 2022, and in April 2024, he confirmed that the band was finished."

He informed Jordan that he had a couple of people that would like to audition. Enter Doug Brown and Dan Searight. Rich also contacted Doug and Dan, telling them that he had a guy who would like to audition to play with them (Jordan). With Rich Mezger on drums, and everyone else thinking that they were holding the audition, things initially clicked. Rich’s idea had worked to get the key players together, but he wound up leaving for college; so Jordan, Doug and Dan began the search for another drummer.

Jordan and soundman, Henry Myers, went to a local record store in Downers Grove to pick up an add paper frequently used by local musicians. While in the store they saw an advertisement for a drummer on the bulletin board. The ad indicated that this drummer was into the same general musical style, and to ""inquire within"". Following the instructions on the board, Jordan and Hank went inside and asked the manager about the ad. It was then that they found out that the manager, one Mr. Steve Tsokatos was the person they were looking for. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to get together later in the week for a jam session. A couple of days later, Steve showed up in a VW Beetle, which was packed to the gills with his Octoplus drum kit. There was barely room in the car for him to drive. The session resulted in the birth of Winterhawk.

Jordan, Doug, Dan and Steve rehearsed vigorously for about 2 months, and booked a live show at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. The show was the first of many that resulted in a healthy cult following in the Chicago area. Dan Searight left and was replaced by Steve Brown, and the band concentrated on live appearances, playing another Aragon show the following year. The live recording of ""Hammer and the Axe"" came from this second Aragon appearance. Steve Brown then left the band to pursue a career as a commercial artist later that summer, and the band settled into a 3-piece unit. They played together as a 3 piece for about 2 more years, opening for acts like Jefferson Starship, Steppenwolf, Black Oak Arkansas, Budgie and others.

At the same time, Jordan's longtime friend Chris Mazur was playing in another band with drummer Scott Benes. The professional relationship between Doug and Jordan started to become difficult. It was becoming clear that personal and musical goals were beginning to go in different directions for Jordan and Doug. Eventually, the 3-piece version of Winterhawk blew up from the inside, and Doug recruited the bass player (Malcolm Williamson) and drummer (Scott Benes) from Mutiny, the band Chris was playing in at the time. Doug asked Chris to join also, but Chris's allegiance was with Jordan. While Steve Tsokatos devoted his time to starting a family, Chris and Jordan decided to attend college, and became roommates at Northern Illinois University. It was there that the brainchild that would become Winterhawk ""Revival"" was borne.

Jordan and Chris began thinking about the business of producing a record album. They listened to several live Winterhawk recordings, and made a list of potential songs. Doug showed interest in the project, and suggested that Scott Benes play drums. The band rehearsed for 7 weekends with Chris understudying the second guitar parts, and then went into Dr. CAW Studios on December 17, 1981. Recording was completed by January 1, 1982. Craig A. Williams manned the boards and Jordan and Chris assisted production through the final mix. The record was released in 1982 on the band's own label and has achieved a formidable cult status among hard rock collectors and enthusiasts."

Founded and led by singer Ian Stuart Donaldson in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, in 1976, relocating to Manchester in 1978. The band originally sported a punk look, but, at their label's urging, became skinheads during the second wave of skinheads in England. Skrewdriver became known for attracting violence at their shows and none of their Chiswick releases did very well in the UK charts. They broke up in 1979.

Donaldson re-formed the band in 1982 as an explicityly White Power National Socialist band, with an entirely new, and often-changing lineup. This new version of Skrewdriver became the musical arm of the British National Front and released as their debut album ""Hail The New Dawn"" in 1984 on the German Rock-O-Rama label. This release not only helped transform the label to a far-right position but effectively invented White Power rock and Skrewdriver quickly became a driving force behind the R.A.C (Rock Against Communism) movement.

In 1993 Ian Stuart died in a car accident, bringing an end to the band.

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Danzig morphed out of the goth punk band Samhain after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin. Rubin was interested in working with Glenn, but not with Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group. Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von and guitarist John Christ and for drums Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. The original line-up recorded band’s first four albums, but during the mid-90’s the group started to disintegrate with first Chuck Biscuits leaving the group and soon after John Christ and Eerie Von followed. At the time Glenn also came at odds with producer Rubin and his label and the two ended collaborations as well.

Following the line-up turmoil Glenn took distance from the blues driven heavy metal that Danzig had become known for and introduced strong industrial sound on “Danzig 5: Blackaciddevil”, a move that was not received well by fans or critics. After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band returned to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, but have not managed to recapture the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records had.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015. The ZFT produced numerous posthumous releases and remasters of the back catalog. The children inherited the ZFT and remain in the industry,  [a237886] the force behind [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/2843814-Dweezil-Zappa-Plays-Zappa] ""[i]Zappa Plays Zappa[/i]"" [/url] as well as an accomplished guitarist in his own right; [a296279], [a1635870] and the more reserved [a296276].

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

A  self-taught guitarist, Hendrix began his musical career backing such R&B greats as Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and B.B. King.

The album, and its 1968 successors - [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Axis-Bold-As-Love/master/24511]Axis: Bold As Love[/url] and the seminal blues-oriented developments of [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Electric-Ladyland/master/24535]Electric Ladyland[/url] - earned Hendrix international acclaim as a premier rock instrumentalist and innovator of his generation. A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

The King Diamond band was formed in 1985 by Danish vocalist King Diamond following the break-up of his previous band, [a=Mercyful Fate].  The original line-up consisted of Diamond, his former Mercyful Fate bandmates Michael Denner (guitar) and Timi Hansen (bass), and Swedes Mikkey Dee (drums) and Andy LaRoque (guitar).  This line-up lasted for two albums before Denner and Hansen departed, the first of many line-up changes for the band.  To date, LaRoque is the only musician besides King Diamond to appear on every King Diamond band release.

With the King Diamond band, Diamond traded the occult-based and blasphemous lyrics of Mercyful Fate for a gothic horror approach.  Almost all of the lyrics on King Diamond's albums revolve around a specific story.  Only the band's debut, ""Fatal Portrait,"" and 1995's ""Spider's Lullaby"" stray from this formula, although, even in those cases, several of the songs on the albums feature lyrics that are related to each other.  In 2003, Hungarian vocalist Livia Zita was brought onboard to provide female vocals.  It marked the first time that King Diamond worked with another vocalist on any of his projects (excluding any guest appearances he made on other artists' projects).  King and Livia were later married.

The group saw their commercial success reach its peak in the mid and late 1980's, and their second album, ""Abigail"" is considered a heavy metal classic.  The group was also a target for parents' and watchdog groups who objected to King Diamond's image and what they perceived to be questionable content (although the latter was mostly based on the King's work with Mercyful Fate and his personal connections to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan).  The band has continued to work steadily, although they have been on hold in recent years because of King Diamond's health issues, which include back surgery in 2007, and a triple-bypass in 2010."

Primal Fear split with Nuclear Blast in 2006 after Mat Sinner left his job as a label rep with the company in January.

Henny Wolter rejoined Primal Fear in 2007, replacing Tom Naumann for the second time. Naumann's departure has not been clarified. The band's other longtime guitarist, Stefan Leibing, departed in February 2008 to spend more time with his family.

Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly swords and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that ""these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that."" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan ""Death to false metal"".

Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as ""Metal Warriors"", ""Manowarriors"", ""Immortals"" or ""Brothers of Metal"".

""I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?"" - Joey DeMaio, during a 2006 interview with Rock Hard Magazine.

Fighting The World (the band's fifth release) was metal's first full-digital recording

The creation of Gods Of War was not devoid of obstacles. The band was forced to delay its release when, deep into the recording sessions, Logan suffered a devastating injuring after crashing on his prized dirtbike. Logan dislocated his elbow in the accident, an injury so severe it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career. But the guitarist fought back and after months of painful rehabilitation, he boasted he has never played his instrument better. 

During Manowar's career, the band have recorded 10 studio albums; two live albums; five DVDs and countless compilations.

Manowar's many innovations include:
* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers
* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles
* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra
* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and their own guitars as well
* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions)

Manowar created Magic Circle Music.

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

Drummer Bill Whyte would replace Burns soon after and on October 31st, 1983, the band unveiled it's new name ""HALLOWEEN"" and became knwon as ""Detroit's Heavy Metal Horror Show"", combining musical theatrics ala Alice Cooper with a heavier brand of metal in the vein of Judas Priest, Twisted Sister and Savatage.

Rick Craig and Bill Whyte would depart in the summer of 1989 and would be replaced by Billy Gray on lead guitar and drummer Tommy Stewart (future Godsmack, Lilian Axe and Lo-Pro) around September of 1989. This lineup recorded the ""Vicious Demo"" release and did several shows with Crimson Glory on their ""Transcendence"" tour.

Unfortunately this lineup would disband by the middle of 1990 and in would come guitarists Donny Allen and Tim Wright (formerly of Detroit thrash band Erebus) as well as drummer Bill ""BA!"" Adams. Tim Wright would be out of the band by roughly the end of 1990, although his contributions would still make the No One Gets Out album in 1991.

In 1993 Craig and Whyte returned to the band for a short lived reunion before the band broke up for the first time officially on October 31st, 1993 after a final farewell show at Harpos Concert Theatre in Detroit, MI.

The band has reunited with several different lineups and has issued several further studio recordings and continues to tour and record to this day."

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002.

They were active from 2001 to 2003 before breaking up, releasing two albums.

History
Stereomud released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. 
After extensive touring in support of that album, they went back into the studio, releasing Every Given Moment in April 2003. 

After participating in the Jagermeister Music Tour with P.E., Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, a mere 3 months after the release of Every Given Moment. 

They have performed a few select reunion shows since this, but for the most part, the band remains dormant to this day. Recently, it was rumored that Erik Rogers and Corey Lowery would reunite to reform the band, but the possibilities may not be true as they are focusing on their own bands. 

It is planned that a Stereomud DVD will be released at some point in the future. Erik Rogers changed band name to 'Dangerous New Machine' with a new lineup February 2009.

Band members:
    * Erik Rogers - vocalist (subsequently in Soundevice, Love Said No and Dangerous New Machine, currently in My Therapy)

Starting as a speed/thrash band that did not survive the '80s, Angel Dust were reformed around 1996-97 with a more modern power metal style. The reformation came about when the original rhythm section of Frank Banx and Dirk Assmuth had been playing in a cover band with guitarist Bernd Aufermann and Frank's younger brother Steven, who suggested reviving the Angel Dust name to record original songs that he and Aufermann had been working on.

Aufermann left the band in 2001 and was briefly replaced by American guitarist Richie Wilkison. Aufermann would return in 2004, but around a year later vocalist Dirk Thurisch decided to quit. After five years with Carsten Kaiser in place, but little in the way of serious activity, Thurisch made a brief return to Angel Dust before the band eventually came to a halt.

A second reunion was announced in September 2016.

The band's first two albums were reissued unofficially in very limited quantities in late 2002-2003. The reissues have no label or copyright info and have two bonus tracks each.

Not to be confused with Angel Dust (later Asmodina) from Darmstadt who released a demo in 1985.

255482,568033,4671716,US,ZAO,Parade Of Chaos,2002,37.75,10,['Album'],['Rock'],['Metalcore'],"Zao is a metalcore band from Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and one of the metalcore groups that rose in popularity at the end of the 90's. Founded in 1993 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

They were initially known for playing extremely complicated compositions with little or no repetition whatsoever. However in 2005 they received alot of attention, praise and criticism for their extended minimalist piece ""OV"" (Ipecac, 2005) which instead utilized repetition to the extreme.

Orthrelm began as a sort of continuation of Mick Barr's earlier guitar/drums duo (with Malcolm McDuffie) Crom-Tech (which itself was sort of a continuation of his short-lived guitar/bass/drums trio Or Rathol Nok) that had broken up, main difference being Orthrelm lacking the vocals. Mick had sent Josh a tape of some songs (later recorded as ""Iorxhscimtor"") he had worked on and wanted to put to rest, Josh answered and some time later Orthrelm was formed. During 2001 Orthrelm recorded nearly their entire output so far, both old pre-Orthrelm material composed solely by Barr and new collaborative material were recorded. Among these were the infamous ""Asristir Veildrioxe"" an album consisting of 99 short micro-compositions in barely 12 minutes. Also released was a split with Touchdown and these tracks could be the pinnacle of the earlier Barr/Blair compositions. During 2002-2004 they worked on composing ""OV"" initially influenced by middle-eastern music. They toured and performed alot during this time. Some acts they toured with include The Locust, Pig Destroyer, Growing and Zombi.

In early 2006 the band were forced to cancel their tour because one of the members was ill. Since then Orthrelm has been very quiet ""active though dormant for most of the time"" as they put it. But they say there's still plans to resurrect and write.

Brand New Sin released one self-titled album with the label Now or Never before signing with Century Media. They toured to support their first Century Media release, Recipe For Disaster with Black Label Society. In 2006, the band released their third studio album titled Tequila.

Brand New Sins first radio hit was the song ""My World""

The song ""Crank It Up"" debuted on WWE.com as a theme song for Big Show on WWE Wreckless Intent, but Big Show still used his old theme song until after the WWE vs ECW battle royal. During Big Show's time on ECW, Show used this theme during his entrance to the ring.

Brand New Sin performed at the 12th annual KRockathon (a one-day music festival presented by the Syracuse, New York radio station WKLL). It was held on July 21, 2007 at the Cayuga County Fair Speedway.

On January 9, 2008 Joe Altier parted ways with Brand New Sin to pursue other interests.

On March 6, 2009 Joe Sweet decided to focus on his family and his many personal endeavors. As the co-organizer of the annual Utica Music and Arts Fest and the proud father to be, Joe decided that the best move is to back out before recording vocal tracks for Brand New Sin's 4th full length album. The recording is due to hit the streets in June 2009 and Sweet will not be available to tour.

Joe Sweet had just left his other band, Nine Ball, when joining Brand New Sin. Recently, BNS did two songs with Joe Sweet called ""Know Yourself"" and ""Rusty Drain"" respectively. Both songs have been posted on Brand New Sin's Myspace for people to listen to.

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

Creeper started out as a recording project that incorporated Milkbone's hard hip-hop beats (mostly sampled loops with 808 kick drums), the heavy guitar riffs of Mike Clark, Mike Jensen's (a.k.a. Milkbone) vocals, and the guitar playing and vocals from long time friend Jimmie ""51"" Romero.

After making a 17 song demo in their home studio, Creeper put together the first Creeper record ""The Songs That Must Not Die..."" Creeper had also put together a complete live band with Michael Alvarado (Beowulf) on drums and Jason Benton on the bass. After playing locally with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, Cyco Miko, LIT, Alien Ant Farm, Sen Dog's SX-10, and many other local and known acts, Suicidal Tendencies started rehearsing and recording again, leaving Creeper without a guitarist. Soon after, Dave Nassie who replaced Adam Siegel in Infectious Grooves was the new guitar player for Creeper. Creeper played Los Angeles and Orange County for about another year before the band temporarily broke up due to personal issues.

Michael Alvarado and Mike Jensen decided to bring back Creeper with a fresh start. The new line up was Mike Jensen, Jason Benton on the bass guitar, Jose Nicholas on the keyboards, and Carl Burmiester on the guitar. The new Creeper was getting a bigger following, radio play, bigger and better shows and a hell of a lot tighter. The sound had changed from heavy guitar riffs and hip hop beats which they had been doing since 1994 to an unpredictable punk, rap, thrash, jazz, lounge, latin hardcore sound. In 1997 Creeper went in to the studio to record ""Lost Dog."" Creeper ""Lost Dog"" did relatively well worldwide and Creeper got offers from bigger labels.

Songs from ""The Song's That Must Not Die..."" can be found on Suicidal Tendencies compilation ""Friends and Family"" and ""Suicidal for Life"", but on the Australian version only. Songs from ""Lost Dog"" can be found on Infectious Grooves ""Borracho"" and ""Friends and Family 2."" In 2007 Creeper appeared on Louiche Mayorga's ""Welcome 2 Venice."" 

 Creeper is now in the studio with a new line up recording their third release ""Venice High Drop Out"" due out in 2013."

Nile was formed in 1993 by Karl Sanders (guitar, vocals), Chief Spires (bass, vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with death metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released ""Festivals Of Atonement"" as cassette / CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as [a=Obituary], [a=Deicide], and [a=Six Feet Under].

In 1996 they got a new guitarist (Dallas Toler-Wade), a deal with Visceral Productions, and released ""Ramses Bringer of War"". Shortly after, Relapse Records saw them play live and listened to their CDs. They offered them a deal, and Nile agreed. And so Nile recorded and released their full-length debut ""Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"" and after the release, they did an 8-month world tour. After their return in 1999, they began working on their next album; it was very tough to make it, and it took a year just to write the lyrics. Sanders spent every night composing, and finally in 2000 they released ""Black Seeds Of Vengeance"".

In 2002, the band returned to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) for the production of the new album ""In Their Darkened Shrines"". Again, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005’s ""Annihilation Of The Wicked"" with engineer Bob Moore and producer / mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Two years and a new record label later, NILE return with ""Ithyphallic"" (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility).

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album, entitled ""Those Whom the Gods Detest"". The album was released in November of the same year. On October 21, 2010, Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new permanent bassist for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On October 11, 2011, Goomba Music released ""Worship The Animal"", which is an alternately titled version of Nile's demo, which the band's original line-up recorded in 1994.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. On June 29th, 2012, Nile released their new album ""At The Gate Of Sethu"".

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing ""unforeseen circumstances beyond my control"". On July 24, 2015, it was announced that the band will be releasing its new album, entitled ""What Should Not Be Unearthed"", on August 28.
On February 13, 2017, Dallas Toler-Wade has decided to leave the band to focus on his own plans and recordings. Brian Kingsland took his place.

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

Brutality reformed twice after the initial split. The first time Brutality's record deal with Still Dead Productions fell through in early 2005 and as a result, the band split up in April 2005.

Vomitory was formed in Sweden in 1989 by Urban Gustafsson (guitar), Ronnie Olson (bass), and Tobias Gustafsson (drums). In 1990, they played their first gig in their hometown of Forshaga. After the gig, Ronnie decided to concentrate on vocals, so Bengt Sund joined the band on bass. Bengt's friend Ulf Dalegren joined the band on guitar in 1991, and the band was now ready to record some material.

In 1992, they released their first demo, which got them in contact with Witchhunt Records. This led to the release of the 7"" single, ""Moribund"". Shortly after, Bengt Sund was asked to leave, before being replaced by Thomas Bergqvist. Labels had begun showing interest, so the band recorded a five track promo CD in the hopes of getting a record deal, but nothing happened. In 1994, they released the demo ""Through Sepulchral Shadows"", and in 1995 they went on a small, but successful tour through Poland.

In 1996, they inked a deal with Fadeless Records and released their debut album, ""Raped in Their Own Blood"". Following the release of the album, both Thomas and Ronnie left the band and were replaced by Erik Rundqvist (bass) and Jussi Linna (vocals). ""Redemption"" followed in 1999, along with two European tours, a split 7"" EP with Murder Corporation, and the 10"" LP entitled ""Anniversary Picture Disc"". In 2000, the band signed to Metal Blade Records and released their third album, ""Revelation Nausea"". However, prior to recording the album, Jussi Linna had left the group. Thus, Erik Rundqvist handled both vocal and bass duties. 

""Blood Rapture"" was released in 2002, and was followed by their fifth album ""Primal Massacre"" in 2004. Guitarist Ulf Dalegren departed in 2005, with Peter Östlund stepping in shortly after. With this lineup, the band released ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize"" in 2007, ""Carnage Euphoria"" in 2009 and ""Opus Mortis VIII"" in 2011. 

In February 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding, playing their final show on December 27, 2013. In 2017, the band reunited for one show to honor an old friend. On March 23, 2018, Vomitory officially reunited to celebrate 30 years since the band's formation."

In 2003 Nödtveidt announced the comeback of Dissection and the renewed band eventually returned to the stage on October 30th, 2004 at the Arenan in Stockholm. Soon after the release of their third album “Reinkaos” on April 30th, 2006, Nödveidt announced the end of Dissection as he “had reached the limitations of music as a tool for expression and with Reinkaos they had managed to manifest a truly Satanic record and the work of Dissection had been done. Now it was time to move on to other realms of practice.” Their final concert was performed on June 24th, 2006 at Hovet, Stockholm. About two months later, on August 13th, 2006, Jon Nödtveidt committed suicide.

Music-wise, Dissection combined various styles of extreme metal with a strong melodic sensibility and a sinister/melancholic atmosphere. Despite often being considered death/black metal, the band themselves refused such categorization and typically referred to their music as Metal of Death, or Anti Cosmic Metal of Death.

Carnal Forge was formed in 1997 by Stefan Westerberg (drums) and Jari Kuusisto (guitar). They were soon joined by Johan Magnusson (guitar), Dennis Vestman (bass) and Jonas Kjellgren (vocals). It didn't take long before they had recorded their first, and only, demo tape entitled ""Sweet Bride"". It was sent to various labels and they were soon signed to Wrong Again Records. 

In 1998 their debut was released, it was called ""Who's Gonna Burn"". The band then 'disapeared' for two years. During that time they left Wrong Again Records and started looking for other labels. As the band had recorded their second album Dennis Vestman left the band but was quickly replaced by Jari's brother Petri Kuusisto. The album was called ""Firedemon"" and Century Media released it in 2000. 

After they were signed to Century Media they embarked on a European tour with The Haunted and Nile. As they began working on their third album Johan Magnusson left the band. Petri switched to guitar and the band then asked Lars Lindén (bass) to join. ""Please... Die!"" was released in 2001. In 2002 they recorded ""The More You Suffer"" and released it in 2003. It was followed by ""Aren't You Dead Yet"" in 2004."

Sikfuk began in Late 2001 in Columbia, SC, USA. Started out as 3 piece band spewing forth brutal guttural deathgrind. 6 song demo Maggots Gorelore was recorded and that brought quick interest to the band from United Guttural Records and they released the first Sikfuk album Gore Delicious in the summer of 2002. In 2003 the 3 song Fingercuffing the Beheaded demo was recorded. 2 of those 3 songs were used on a Russian label comp titled ""The United Colours of Gore"" and was released by Not like most Records. All 3 songs were later used in 2006 for a split cd for the repress of the Kretan Christian Corpse Mutilation CD (Kretan was Nik Blanton and Mark Rawls of Sikfuk) on Comatose Music. By mid 2005 both the bass player and drummer had left the band. A new drummer was added in mid 2005 and the band relocated to St.Paul, MN and in the fall of 2006 Teabagged At Birth was released on Goregiastic Records. In the fall of 2007 Sikfuk decided to go solo and use a drum machine. 2008 was spent writing new material for the first time as a one man project. In 2009 Sikfuk landed a deal with Comatose Records and released the album Shitfisted Superman... The Man of Stool that fall. Sikfuk went through a brief hiatus in late 2010 to late 2011 and then relocated to Madison, WI. 2012 was spent writing new music and reinventing the Sikfuk sound adding more influences of goregrind, grindcore and powerviolence to it's already whacked out version of guttural brutal death metal. In April of 2013 Pathologically Explicit Recordings released the Sikfuk/Demented Retarded split ""Miss Pavian...Bound, Gagged, Dunked."" In 2014 Sikfuk worked on material for another split. This time adding way more of a goregrind/pornogrind sound to the music and even adding in some pitch shifted vocals. In May of 2015 Splatter Zombie Records released the ""Fecal Fuck Stick Split"" with EFRO. 2015 also saw the end of Sikfuk being a one man band adding his wife, Loogie Lobber Lezlie, to do pitch shifted backing vocals, pig snorts, and whatever other nasty ass pornogore noises she can bark out. Sikfuk is currently working on new material for a full length album and that will hopefully be released late this year or early 2017."

FF was started by Dino Cazares (Guitars) and Raymond Herrera (Drums) when the band was initially called Ulceration. Burton C. Bell (Vocals) and Christian Olde Wolbers (Bass) were added later after the band switched the name to Fear Factory.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head, and Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers. Burton C. Bell left the band in late 2020. On February 21, 2023, the band announced that they have recruited Milo Silvestro as their vocalist. "

Formed by Jared Deaver (guitar), Sean McGrath (guitar), Ron Dorn (bass) Raul Varela (drums) and Jeremy Frye (vocals). Jeremy soon left the band and Jared and Sean then both took over vocals. In 1997 they recorded their first demo, ""Septic Vomit"". Shortly after Jared received throat cancer and was forced to leave the band. He was then replaced by Leon del Muerte. ""From Here to Colostomy"", the second demo, was released in 1999 which featured Sean handling both guitar and bass. Ron's replacement was Tom Persons of Enthroned but his stay was short as he left soon. Ross Sewage (bass, vocals) of Exhumed then took his place and eventually became a permanent replacement. Same year they also did a split 7"" EP with Cephalic Carnage. 

The band played several gigs and in 2000 they released their first full-length album, ""The Dead Shall Dead Remain"", along with the 7"" split with Engorged and shortly after the band then went on a tour with Nile and Incantation. In 2001 the compilation EP ""Choice Cuts"" was released. After the release they embarked on tours with the likes of Vader, Origin and Skinless. After the tour Leon del Muerte left the band but was quickly replaced by Andrew LaBarre. 

In 2002 they released ""Mondo Medicale"" which was an instant succes. It was followed by the EP ""Medical Waste"" same year and the split cd ""Dimentia Rex"" with Haemorrhage in 2003.

259856,12573,2779618,Germany,Borknagar,Empiricism,2001,50.03,10,['Album'],['Rock'],['Viking Metal'],"Progressive metal band from Bergen, Norway.

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

Formed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Los Natas put the second largest South American nation on the world's stoner rock map almost single-handedly. Coming together in the mid-90's, guitarist/vocalist Sergio Chotsourian, bassist Miguel Fernandez and drummer Walter Broide displayed a distinct Kyuss obsession on their 1996 debut Delmar, which was sung almost exclusively in Spanish. But subsequent releases such as 1999's Ciudad de Brahman and 2002's Corsario Negro (featuring new bassist Gonzalo Villagra) quickly expanded upon this oft-borrowed blueprint, adding sonic elements culled from space rock, psychedelia and even jazz, meshing and elevating them all to heights arguably never scaled south of the Equator. Not content to sit on their laurels, the group's 2003's Toba Trance delved into Indian music over the course of three songs spread over sixty-minutes.

CRAWLSPACE originated as a side project from the other bands that its current members were in at the time. As CRAWLSPACE rose, these bands declined. Adi Tejada's band SOMNAMBULIST had broken up, Danny Walker left [a2195342] due to ""political differences"" and the ambition to start a serious project, and Graham Clise parted ways with [a1076689] to pursue something new. Adi teamed up with lead guitarist Eric Gormley to form the framework of Crawlspace/Uphill Battle. 

The first Uphill Battle line-up consisted of Adi on guitar and vocals, Eric on lead guitar, Danny on drums and vocals and Graham on bass and vocals. The quartet began to write material together and in the span of a couple of months, they finished writing the songs for what would later be 'Demo #1.' The band then changed their name to Uphill Battle. 'Demo #1' was recorded in May, 1999.

Uphill Battle played their first show at the Pickle Patch June 7th, 1999. Three months later, they entered the studio and recorded the ""Writing in the Dark"" for a split 7"" with [a2247389] on[l252550]. In the summer of 2000, Graham left the group to play drums full time for the youth-crew punk band [a1268778]. Graham was replaced by Jehf Jones, former vocalist for [a1076689]. Eric left the band shortly after Jehf joined and was replaced by Jeff Capra, former guitarist for EMBASS, [a1642280], [a2911166], [a4389092], [a627082]and current guitarist of [a1310141].

Uphill Battle entered the studio in March, 2001 with producer Nick Rucker, and recorded the songs that would eventually comprise their Relapse debut. Shortly after the recording was complete Jehf announced that he was planning to move away and that Uphill Battle should start looking for a new bassist. Joe Gonzalez promptly joined the band. Relapse Records, upon hearing the band's new material, made Uphill Battle the newest members of the Relapse family.

Uphill Battle disbanded in 2006.

White Knuckle Trip has built a considerable fan base in several cities including: Milwaukee, Madison, South Bend, Peoria, Chicago, Detroit, and many other Midwestern cities.

They have frequented large venues such as The Metro in Chicago, and have made a home out of probably the largest venue in Wisconsin, The Rave in Milwaukee. White Knuckle Trip has played with such national acts as: Hed(pe), Sevendust, Coal Chamber, Machine Head, Earth Crisis, Nothingface, Downset, Factory 81, Relative Ash, Full Devil Jacket, Amen, Corrosion of Conformity, Godsmack, From Zero, Adema and many more.

Being a part of Milwaukee's elite performers, White Knuckle Trip have given back to the community by playing free shows to support a Breast Cancer Benefit as well as Racine's annual Food For Thought benefit in March 2002. They have performed for large crowds of dedicated followers as well as new faces on the Summerfest Lazer 103 Rock Stage.

White Knuckle Trip's positive attitude and spirituality bring a powerful blend of heavy alternative and metal together to create a unique sound that spawns emotion and angst within a sometimes dry genre. Their music is a creative escape from the heavy-metal cliches so prevalent today, but is still well grounded in what makes the new wave of heavy bands so popular in modern rock music.

White Knuckle Trip's fan base ranges from young to old and their live shows provide unmatched intensity and heart through true belief in their music. White Knuckle Trip carry the staying power and intelligence of an educated group of dedicated musicians.

They began in the garage of lead singer Jimmy Grant as he, and high school friend and drummer Everett Sailor, annoyed their Kissimmee neighbors with their loud and abstract music. One day however a neighbor from across the street, interested instead of disgusted in the odd noises resonating daily, introduced himself as Buddy Fischel to the already named duo Indorphine with an interest in joining forces. An experienced guitar player from Syracuse, NY, Fischel was welcomed into the band and their lineup was nearly complete. Local bassist and songwriter Dan Stewart entered the picture, and the band was then ready to begin forging ahead. Dan contributed several songs to the band which provided them with enough material to begin playing live. The first Indorphine concert occurred on May 5, 2001, at Midtown Tavern in Orlando, FL. After performing locally for several months, the band entered Crush Studios to record their first full-length album entitled 12 Lbs. During the recording of 12 Lbs. Indorphine met Adam Phillips, another New Yorker and guitar virtuoso, when their respective bands played a benefit show for the late Chuck Schuldiner. Phillips became one of Indorphine's earliest diehard local fans. He began following the band from show to show and became their guitar tech until Indorphine heard his extensive talent and offered to make him an official member just before the release of their debut record. Adam obliged and parted ways with his previous band to explore this new opportunity. After Dan Stewart was relieved of his duties due to private reasons, bassist and vocalist, and Indiana native, Tanner Keegan took a chance leaving the Orlando band Milka to explore his options with the experimental Indorphine; completing their classic lineup."

The band, was initially a side project consisting of Will ""Willverine"" Price, and Marc Mays who were room mates, that began experimenting during jam sessions. Both Marc and Will were involved in different projects at the time, but when they included J. Harman as the third man in their jam session, they being satisfied with the chemistry and sound, agreed to work on this project. During the November of 1994, Boiler, was born.

As they began producing demos, Boiler soon realized that the band was much more successful than they have ever anticipated. In light of the of the positive reception, the band, were inspired more than ever to continue on, and perfect their “dirtcore” sound, as they called it. Their work was not in vein, eventually attracting the interest of Mayhem Records, and thus signing a deal. This led to their first full length release “The New Professionals - Rules for Industrial Slammitude and Groovination” in April 1998.

Response to the CD was very positive, and the band saw a surge of support. Notably, within the aftermath of the first album, the band’s songs “Roswall” and “Frontin” were featured on the Beavis and Butthead “Do U” video game. Howard Stern was also known for playing clips of the song “Frontin” on his highly acclaimed radio show. In the year after the release, the trio, embarked on a massive touring schedule playing along side acts such as Crowbar, Backstreet Law, and Deist Requim. During this time the band began to further build a healthy fan-base. Furthermore, Boiler was also a part of the prestigious Milwaukee Metal Fest and The Cleveland World Series of Metal in 1998 and 1999, respectively. They served as an opening for major acts such as Bad Religion, Biohazard, Pro-Pain, Testament, Pissing Razors, Stuck Mojo, Dio, Blue Oyster Cult, etc. They during this time covered Pantera’s “Mouth of War” which found its way on the Pantera cover album, called Panther.

In January 2000, Marc decided to leave Boiler to pursue other ventures within his life. With J. and Will still dedicated making the band work, enlisted new member Brian Robarge, who filled in on the guitarist/vocalist duties.On January 17th, the new Boiler was formed, the band’s second reincarnation. Subsequently, Boiler, released the EP dubbed “YEE-HAW!!!” in June 2000 (which is noted with the distinction of being the last release with Marc on it). The album featured the band’s trademark groove laden “dirtcore”, and as an extra bonus included the band’s cover of “Mouth of War”, by Pantera.

In 2002, they released their final album “Cow Tipping in C Sharp” was released. This marked the end of the Boiler"

Founding members GOTTI and Rojo both felt at equals with their disturbing forethoughts of what is now Low gear.

Low gear's receptive channeling explores and exploits the genius in what some describe as mental sickness. Thus, claiming its final members, Goat and Minister Roach, was a predestined conscription. A 3-song demo was released in late 1999 and quickly spread from Dallas, to the web, to a mammoth number of silicon embodiments across the world. What's next?

Final Air is a Christian band that plays melodic, nu-metal music. The meaning of the band's name has to do with each individual personally. It relates to your final breath in life. Once you have reached that, you have no more chances of doing things on your own. No more choices. No more life.

Years went by, Goody joined the service, Jamie played in a band called Nasty Habits with his brother Jeff. Then through personnel changes, and Goody rejoining Jamie, Backstreet Law was formed.

Through the 90's, BSL toured up and down the East Coast, sharing the stage with many big-name alternative metal bands, and at one point hosted (and coordinated) an annual outdoor concert called SummerFest, allowing lots of local bands to open for them, essentially giving them the opportunity to play to a big party-ready crowd.

More years went by, with the band releasing four studio albums, ""Hockey Helmet"", ""Special Delivery"", ""Hollow"", and ""Frustrated"" along the way. More personnel changes occurred, and in 2006 the band decided to change their name to coincide with the new direction their music was taking.

Attica continued touring for nearly two years before taking a break to begin working on new material. They entered Audio Lab studios to demo three new songs: Libel, Killjoy, and High Diver. A month later the band's new demo was finished and ready to be released. The demo went over very well among fans and the media alike earning them a great amount of attention from Inverse-Music, East Coast Romper, Focus, and a host of other magazines and websites.

Later that year; the band headed into Zen Recording studios to start work on their 3rd full length album; Undone. The record included new mixes of Killjoy, Libel, and High Diver as well as a cover of REM’s End Of The World. Attica spent a little over four months finalizing what would be their most successful album to date. The album received nationwide attention in its opening weeks as the single Pushing Me impacted radio stations around the country.

In August of 2002 Attica joined the Inverse Tour, and traveled through December. Following that tour the band took on opening slots with Anthrax, and later Mudvayne. After a brief hiatus (2004-2006), Attica was offered several spots on local showcases as well as the 2007 Warped Tour, spawning a brief reunion before eventually going back on hiatus indefinitely in 2008.

Drummer Stephen Baucom and guitarist Jasan Stepp met while paratroopers in the military. They discussed forming a band, taking the name Margret Heater from a character in a story written years before. They soon recruited lead singer Duke Aipa to be their frontman.

Although not a member of the earliest incarnation of Margret Heater, Greg Plummer had played in a high school band called ""Uncle Lumpy"" with Stepp. Uncle Lumpy released one recording, an album called Chicken A La King.

With a deadly combination of slow-grooving hardcore riffs combined with singing and screaming melodies of two different vocalists, this crew regularly tears down venue after venue all over Northwestern Pennsylvania, Northeastern Ohio and parts of New York.

Formed during the winter of 2000, Dedloft spent many prior years as hard rock act ""Gutwrench"", establishing a local fan base before launching the current line-up. Anxious to get things rolling, Dedloft were soon steadily practicing, booking shows, and recording their first release by January of 2002.

Word of Dedloft's infectious sound spread rapidly throughout Erie County and surrounding areas as the band would go on to sell over 1000 copies of their debut E.P. within months of its original release. By the fall of 2002 Dedloft were ready to head back into Watchmen Studios and begin recording their sophomore effort, a three-song demo that sold 400 plus copies in less than eight weeks. The band later compiled these recording with studio sessions recorded in early 2003 to form what is now their full-length L.P. Burned.

Burned is twelve tracks of energetic hard rock that has helped to establish the band as one of Erie's leading musical talents. Tracks from the album receive airplay on Edinboro University's 88.9 F.M., Gannon University's FM 90 and other popular rock stations within the area. The songs are heavy and driving but maintain a sense of pop-accessibility that allows for Dedloft to draw fans from many different genres of alternative music. The added flavor of having an electronic keyboardist in the band, allows Dedloft to dabble with eerie tones and samples that add depth and mood to their songs and performances. Burned has gone on to sell a respectable 800 copies over the last 6 months with virtually no distribution (circa 12/03).

Apart from having a solid full-length album under their belts, Dedloft has made a name for themselves by having an unrelenting work ethic. The band promotes, books, finances, and often runs sound for their live musical endeavors. The band remains devoted to their fans by always putting on explosive performances that are accepting of all walks of life. This positive attitude behind their aggressive music has made for a strong and steadily growing base of loyal fans. The band has already had the privilege of sharing the stage with such national acts as Mushroomhead, Pro-Pain, Dope, Slitheryn, Run-Devil-Run and A Love for Enemies.

Other achievements for Dedloft include winning Planet Radio 93.9F.M./Budweiser Battle of the Bands contest at Sherlock's Erie, PA in early 2003. The win came after several heart-felt performances that beat out 17 other local talents and attracted sell-out crowds. Dave Richards of The Erie Daily Times quoted a judge of the contest, Sia Michels, as saying, ""It was fun to come back home after so long and come to Sherlock's, where I used to hang out. Just to see a huge turnout like this is impressive. It's a cold, snowy Wednesday night, and the place is just packed."" Sia Michels is an Erie native and current executive editor of Spin, a national music magazine. These large crowds that have impressed such music figures as even Michels, are a regular occurrence for Dedloft.

Recently, Dedloft's fan base has only continued to grow. It's not uncommon to roll up to a Dedloft show and see fans sporting Dedloft windbreakers, hoodies, T-shirts, and using they're patented can coozies or spinning Dedloft yo-yos. In the music industry, name recognition is an important aspect of survival. Few bands in Erie County, PA are more of a household name than Dedloft. With this type of local success many bands often become ""big-headed,"" but the modest and straightforward members of Dedloft rise above scene rivalry and remain committed to their music and their local music scene.

During the past few months, Dedloft have begun work on a new release at Diecaster Studios in Erie, PA. The members are all very excited about the recording and have begun to perform some of the new tracks live to the pleasure of many anxious fans. Expect to hear more great music coming your way from this motivated crew as they continue to tour through the Erie and surrounding region."

This dynamic group was formed in 1997 and rhythmically transfuses explosive rock with the steadiness and groove of hip-hop, funk, and metal creating their unique style and sound derived from years of playing music and writingsongs. The band drew influences ranging from artists such as Rage Against The Machine, Pink Floyd, and the late 2 Pac Shakur. With his lyrically unorthodox style, Mario ""Showtime"" Guadan serves as the band's mouthpiece breaking all the rules and making no apologies for it. He demonstrates eyebrow-raising skills as both an intelligent rapper and as a seasoned vocalist. ""Showtime"" leaves no mind un-stimulated as he spits flawless raps about pain, love, dreams, hope, addiction, and even life on Mars. Guitarist Neil Fox lays down his guitar rhythms with aggressive and consistent melodic content and is no stranger to the term ""unorthodox""; his 8-string guitar custom made by Conklin just might be the reason. Seasoned veteran Bassist, Rob Baird has toured the United States in the past with reggae group Shockshine and is the solid backbone of the group; laying down phat bass lines and a powerful groove. Drummer, Dave Fulkerson has performed with reggae legend Eek-a-mouse; as he sets the foundation with solid beats; adding funk and reggae roots while incorporating imagination into their signature style. 

Drop Logic has performed with artists such as Alien Ant Farm, Coolio, Living Colour, Delinquent Habits and Phunk Junkees at top venues, including the Galaxy Theater, the world famous Whisky A'Go Go, Dragonfly, The Glass House, and different Camel/Budweiser events.

""the HELIO manifesto

(EST. 1996) HELIO have been a constant force to be reckoned with since their emergence onto the heavy music scene in Northeast Tennessee. They are a six-piece (voice, guitars, drums, bass, and noise) outfit known as much for their musically diverse sound as their incendiary live performances. HELIO never fails to grasp, conquer, and destroy the senses of listeners, audiences and critics alike.

Although HELIO have been unfairly pigeon-holed into different musical categories, the band prefers to remain uncategorizable. Drawing influences ranging from punk and hardcore to death metal and industrial, they assimilate genres together seamlessly, creating a mixture potentially more destructive than napalm. HELIO spits in the face of adversity and through combined dysfunctions remain defiantly radical in thought and fiercely independent in spirit.

Their first full length recording ""Perfect Mistake"" was released independently in 2000. Although, soundwise, they have matured since this recording, the energy of the music is still present in HELIO today. If anything, the group is more focused, fully capable of annihilating eardrums beyond the new millenium. HELIO are constantly evolving and participating in different musical projects, opening minds and breaking down every barrier in their way. They have shared the stage with national acts such as Lollipop Lust Kill, The Pietasters, the Step Kings, and Jepetto as well as the notorious 2 Live Crew. They also recently played two dates on the 2002 vans warped tour and shared stages with acts such as Beloved, Hopesfall, the Halo Friendlies and Stretch Armstrong.

HELIO have just released their new album(the first in almost 3 years)entitled ""...until i wake up bleeding..."" recorded at the legendary Austin Enterprise (Mass.) with producer Steve Austin of Today Is The Day fame. The album is a drastic change, both musically and emotionally, from previous releases. However, this harsh transition is absolutely necessary to the evolution of the band and thus far is their most profound and accomplished work to date. Clocking in at just over 54 minutes with absolutely no pauses between tracks, the album plays like a fractured and jagged concept album, custom made to play over and over again at maximum volume with repeated themes, subliminal messages and disturbing interludes firmly intact. You can check out 3 songs from the new album at www.mp3.com/helio.

Just like a brutal interstate accident...they demand your attention.

Like the sound of helpless animals being butchered...you can't get them out of your head.

As pleasant as a punch in the face...

THIS IS HELIO.

You have been warned!"""

You can attribute this diverse sound to the band members meeting in a high school music class and keeping their horizons broad ever since.

The members of Cheva have endured the agony of defeat too many times. What haven't they encountered? Only one of the most disturbing probabilities an artist will encounter in their long road to recognition. What might we ask? The fact that Cheva has been playing the same style of music for four long years, and only now is this genre of music getting the recognition it deserves. With the music history behind this band, one might think that recognition would be inevitable.

Although not a widely known fact, Cheva vocalist Santos once played drums in the early incarnation of Coal Chamber. With opening slots for Testament, Spineshank, Incubus, Snot, Drown, new Capital recording artist Zebrahead, Six Feet Under, and new Sony music recording artist Dial-7. With all the new up and coming artists from Orange County, Cheva definitely has the drive and dedication with potential to leave their stain in Orange County, then the world!

The pride, passion, joy, and pain we endure, the life shaping experiences which define who we are, are expressed unfiltered through our music. Constantly fed by our influences, our musical style continues evolving into something bigger than just a Hip-Hop/Rock/Reggae hybrid. It represents the direction of culture itself. Boundaries are being erased, as the world becomes smaller by the minute.

Supporting and being supported by such acts as the KottonMouthKings,Capitol eye, Shuvel, Insolence, Fencekiller, Cukoosnest, and the Shapeshifters just to name a few, the impressions we've made and the fans we have gained have made knecbone even hungrier to spread the message further.

After his departure from Insolence and Maverick/Warner Records, LIFTED blasted out of San Jose California in 2001. They have been booking tours and playing shows ever since. These four close-knit friends and family members came together in the hopes of transforming the music scene today, by concentrating on catchy hooks, memorable verses, and being close and loyal to their fans. Through LIFTED these guys are able to touch the world on a spiritual level through their music while bringing their message to the forefront of the open-minded. Their unique blend of reggae, punk and rock music along with catchy melodies and choruses incorporated into a touch of hip hop, is brilliantly utilized to balance out their signature sound. Their goal is to write forever music; members Derek aka Positive D (Vocals) Freddy Vega (guitar), Mad Mando (drums), and Drew Down (bass) work with great passion on making that happen time and time again. This passion has created what their music has evolved into today: a new driving force of four gifted, aggressive friends ready to take on the world with the intention of spreading their universal language of music. After receiving local, national and international recognition following their debut album, LIFTED is concentrating on spreading their message nonstop around the world. With their latest release and by far their best, “FREEDOM” LIFTED brings new musical motivation and talent to the table, proving once again that they are a force to be reckoned with. While staying completely grounded, some are dubbing Lifted’s new sound as “The Future of Bay Area Music”. Each member clearly brings their own individual contribution and personal influences to the stage while managing to pour out a synergistic musical brotherhood, especially with the energy served up in their live performances. The name? Uncomplicated, but significant was thought of way back, when drummer Mando, who also formed Insolence in 1995 (once signed to Maverick / Warner Bros) was seeking a side project from his former band. Unknown then that this would become a full time deal for these comrades, the group wanted the name to be simple, but effective, and therefore chose the name LIFTED. To them LIFTED encompasses many meanings. Foremost, it means to reach out and spread their love of music to everyone, everywhere. Their ultimate mission is to get those who listen “LIFTED”."

The instrumental trio, though having no formal vocalist at the time, wrote their first set and some rough lyrics. They had an idea of what their front man should sound like. After months of auditioning over 20 likely candidates, they still had no luck. Though some stayed longer than others, the band was still not feeling what they had previously envisioned. At this point Bruce decided to call his old friend Steven Paul. Steve, the former front man and driving force behind Feyd Rautha accepted the invitation.
After their first practice they knew that the chemisry they had been seeking had finally arrived. Sessions began immediately, and shows began in early '99 around the Youngstown music scene.
During the summer of 2000 the band began tracks on its first full length album. The album, though their finest work to date, was on a collision course with time. The ill-fated tracks were put on hold, and never released due to Lesnaks departure from the band. He was accepted into The University of Arizona Conservatory of Recording Arts, and moved shortly after his notification. Nates departure left a hole in the band they thought would never be filled.

The search for a replacement seven-string player ensued. Though a few people had come and gone none could replace the element Nate had brought to the band. After many disappointing try outs and dead end leads they nearly called it quits. To quote Behind the Music ""they almost lost it all.""
But after a while Mike and Steve decided to start working on some new material. They decided to depart from their earlier heavy Rap-Core style to a more groove oriented style with straight forward vocals. After a period of writing they brought Bruce back in to the mix to form the band that performs today."

Since the formation of Crooked in the winter of 1998, the band has remained focused and hard at work. While their original three-track recording was circulating through computers and cities all over the world, the band was constantly playing shows and writing new and improved material. A year and a half after the formation of the band, they had already secured an interview with the highly-rated Farmclub.com TV show at Universal Studios. This interview helped spawn a buzz with the listeners, who voted Crooked the 2nd best-unsigned metal band in the country, and 5th overall styles of music, and received on-air recognition from millions of viewers by host Matt Pinfield(MTV, VH-1).

Returning to the studio just a year after the demo's release, Crooked recorded their self-titled full-length album at Trident Studios in Pacheco, CA with Vile frontman Juan Urteaga(Skinlab, 36 Crazyfists) producing. Consisting of 11 songs, the CD's combination of unique aggressive guitar riffs and catchy hooks layered with creepy industrial sounds and unforgettable vocal melodies sparked an instant connection to any listener. With their energetic and entertaining live performances and commanding stage presence, they have been hailed as a ""Must-see live band!"" by Los Angeles-based Rock City Magazine.

Crooked's fan base began growing at an uncontrollable pace. The overwhelming buzz about them has caught the attention of many in the music industry, including former Fear Factory guitarist Dino Cazares and Professional Murder Music frontman, Roman Marisak. The two decided to take on producing and engineering roles on Crooked's current EP, which was recently recorded at Plan-A studios in Van Nuys, CA. The mastering was handled by Eddy Schreyer (Korn, Slipknot, System of a Down, Tool, Coal Chamber, Fear Factory) who had taken an interest in Crooked from previous releases.

Commonly described as ""the next big thing"" by many fans and critics alike, Crooked has proven themselves as a band not to be taken lightly, having shared the stage with the likes of Staind, Powerman 5000, Sevendust, Kittie, Dope, (Hed)pe, Nonpoint, Spineshank, Otep, Twiztid, RA, and Ill Nino at such notable venues as the Fitchburg Municipal Airport, Wallace Civic Center, Whisky-a-GoGo, Roxy, Key Club, Galaxy Theatre, Troubadour, and the legendary Fillmore Theatre.

Formed in 1995 in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Head of Lies spent two years writing and developing their sound, and playing shows around Oklahoma and Kansas.

Early in 1997, they decided that it was time to commit some tracks to a recording. Using little more than an 8-track digital recorder and some descent microphones, Javier recorded the bands first demo, ""The Missing Link"" in the band's living room. Head of Lies fully produced the entire demo, including designing and creating all of the artwork for the CD.

In early 1998, realizing that their opportunities were limited in Oklahoma, Head of Lies decided to relocate. Portland seemed an ideal choice.

Arriving in late 1998, the band immediately started visiting local clubs and checking out music shows, both large and small. Deciding that their first demo was not representative of their current sound, Head of Lies got to work on a new EP.

Finished in early August 1999, ""Trapped Ugly"" was again fully recorded and produced by the band. It has a much more professional sound to it.

At this time, Head of Lies continued to write new material and play shows around the Portland area pursuing a career in the music industry.
It was not until 2002 that they released their studio album Clay And Needles. After this, no further information was received from the band."

Sacramento is proud to present a band that consists of five suburban-bred white boys whose influence range from Led Zepplin to N.W.A., a little NOFX, and Sade. This combination was bound to eventually create the sound of a band called Contents Under Pressure. Josh (guitar/vocals), Steve (vocals), and Drew (drums), friends since grade school, are rounded up with the strong bass grooves provided by Jeremiah, who Josh was lucky enough to meet while working at a record store one summer. Since officially forming in January of 2000, Contents Under Pressure has been writing music, recording, and playing shows throughout Sacramento and surrounding areas. Soon after the release their first CD ""5 Premium Cuts"" in early August 2000, the band recruited turntable/sample guru DJ Chris. With DJ Chris on board the band looks forward to the further evolution of its' sound. The band's first single ""Throw Your Hands,"" from the Contents Under Pressure debut disc was also featured on Sacramento radio station 98 Rock's local compilation CD Sacramento Rocks VII, also released in 2000. Besides ""Throw Your Hands"", which the band describes as more of a hip-hop party song, the Contents Under Pressure debut also features the song ""Creation."" ""Creation"" is a song on which Josh and Steve's lyrical collaboration explores some of the deeper questions that are commonly asked about life. Also featured on the debut is the song, ""Hit the Floor."" On this song, Steve vents his frustrations with the local hip-hop scene, through a brilliant autobiographical account of a night at a local hip-hop show, in which someone pulling a gun resulted in a violent end of the show. Other tracks to check out are ""Stay true to the Game"" and ""Nothing to Say"". These songs help to showcase the band's hard driving guitar grooves, and conscious hip-hop vocals that convey a heartfelt underground feel. In March of 2001 Contents Under Pressure was one of five local Sacramento bands to be nominated for a SAMMIE award in the music category of best Rap/Hip-hop group. A SAMMIE is music award given by the local music community, and magazine Sacramento News & Review honoring achievements of local Sacramento artists.

Coming up with the backbone of the song that would be known as Fight, the thought of starting a real band became apparent. Still, the need for a vocalist and drummer stood in the way of writing more songs. After school one day, Alan was walking through the halls looking for a ride home or something to do when he saw an old acquaintance: Jeremy. Not having talked to Jeremy in over a year, Alan asked Jeremy if he wanted to jam. Jeremy played guitar and Alan played bass. Just for kicks, Jeremy picked up the mic and Alan switched to guitar. He began to play a rough version of Fight and Jeremy just freestyled and screamed along. Strangely, it sounded good. Realizing their vocalist had been found, Jeremy called his little brother, Steve, to lay down some beats. Now the band began to take shape. The next day, the four of them played all together for the first time. The band had formed. For a month or so, they played as a foursome, trying out a keyboardist here, a dj there. A keyboardist was added, but a keyboard alone didn't offer enough options for the music to expand. Enter DJ Prophet. Prophet dj'ed, sampled, and played keyboards; all the things Hearsay was looking for. That completed the current lineup of Jeremy on vocals, Chris on guitar, Alan on bass, Steve on drums, and DJ Prophet on keyboards, samples, and turntables.
Although Hearsay TAO is young, the band is growing very quickly. Even though they are still in high school, they have opened up for national acts, such as P.O.D., Guano Apes, Clutch, and some of the area's largest local bands, like Fringe, Innercorse, Workhorse Movement, Forge, and more. They will be recording an ep soon that will be available on this site and local record stores.

Hearsay's musical intensity is only matched by a stage show, full of kung fu, spooky interludes, and band members losing it on stage. If you haven't seen them yet, you're missing out on some phat shit that allows you to take out your aggressions among (or on) friends. "

The common bond they all share is as strong as the rock from which they carve their fierce yet melodic compositions.

The first incarnation of the band (then known as Trustfall) oozed from the sidewalks of Boston in December 1998. Local and regional gigs followed and the band gained praise from local critics as well as many internet fanzines. The band's reputation began to grow and enabled them to secure gigs all over New England, as well as New York and Pennsylvania.

In August 2000, the band gained a new singer and a second guitarist. With this new line-up, No December came to be what it is today: Ryan Potts-Vocals, Matt Raftery-Drums, Zachary Weber-Guitar, Andy K.-Bass and Steve Cronin-Guitar. The new line-up debuted less than a month later at the Continental in NYC. Regional gigs played since have proven that the band's new more melodic sound has been accepted by the old fans and has won over many new converts. In December 2000, the band released their infamous, independently produced, and now out of print ""four song EP"". This release went on to be one of the highest selling internet mail order titles in the Wonderdrug Distribution catalog to date.

What sets No December apart from other bands in their genre is that their songs are reality based, extremely melodic, and memorable. In each song, singer Ryan Potts carries the listener through a heart felt story of love, trust, betrayal, or sorrow that people can not only relate to, but truly feel. His melodies are infectious, and have no boundaries of range. As the band constantly strives to push the limits of heavy melodic music, they pour their hearts without reserve into their melodic and aggressive compositions. It is for this reason that the bands live performances fail to disappoint.

After the departure of vocalist Ryan Potts in May 2003, the band recruited vocalist TJ DeMonte who is a longtime friend of Steve and Matt's as well as their former bandmate in Sugarmilk (Hartford CT). TJ brought a unique and powerful presence. His melodies are haunting and infectious and are the perfect compliment to the bands instrumentation.

No December has developed a loyal fan base by touring regionally throughout the Northeast and spreading their sound over the internet and radio. The band has just released a new full length record entitled ""In the Essence of Innocence"" which was recorded by producer Jim Foster of Nullset. The production work on the record is excellent, and perfectly complements the band's style. The record was released on February 5, 2002 and features the band's latest material as well as re-recorded versions of the songs previously released on their four song EP.

In May of 2011, No December announced its return, with the return of Ryan Potts on vocals and Andrew Carcerano taking over on guitar.

No December is ready to spearhead music in the 21st century. Their latest release and a rigorous performance schedule will cement their reputation as one of New England's premier loud rock experiences."

The origin of this group is with two coworkers, who shared an interest in progressive music. Ted Thomas and Patrick McFarland originally became friends in 1998 at an Austin Texas computer Company. They shared a love of progressive music, but it would take some more time before any ideas of a band surfaced. The next year Ted met Mick Peters at (of all places) a ProjecKt Three concert. Mick revealed that he was learning to play the stick. In 2000 Ted finally got a drum set, and contacted Mick. Patrick joined on keyboards, and they began jamming as a trio. Still, they needed a guitarist. In 2001 Joe Funk's band Two Sheds (with whom they had a friendly relationship) broke up. They were more than happy to bring him into the group.
2002 was an eventful year. They picked the name, and recorded a demo. They received an invitation to play the ""Cattleprog"" festival, but Patrick had decided to pursue other musical avenues (namely Copperdown). After placing an ad, they found keyboardist Thad Miller."

Since the departure of bassist [a=Sasaki Hisashi] in 2004, Tatsuya proceeds playing solo with only a drum-kit as [a=Ruins Alone]. Formed in 1985, the group was intended to be a power trio; after a handful of rehearsals as a trio, the band abandoned the guitar and chose to move forward as a two-piece.

Ruins produce a unique fusion of punk and progressive/noise rock, with elements of jazz fusion, math rock and zeuhl, with all material composed and written in a score form by Tatsuya Yoshida. French band [a=Magma (6)] was one of the group's most important influence, such as Ruins' original lyrics were mainly written in an invented language similar to [i]Kobaïan[/i] language, invented by [a=Christian Vander] of Magma.

On their first recordings, Ruins teamed up with NYC experimental sax-icon [a=John Zorn], who would later release their albums on [l=Tzadik]. Ruins have collaborated with several other musicians, including prominent avant-garde figure [a=Derek Bailey], auteur guitarist/multi-instrumentalist [a=Keiji Haino] and Ground Zero alumnus [a=Kazuhisa Uchihashi].

After the last bassist a=Sasaki Hisashi] left the band, Yoshida went on a 'Bassist Wanter Tour' in 2005, performing his material solo with a task to recruit a new companion for the project. Since then, he decided to pursue a solo unit as [b][a=Ruins Alone][/b]. For instance, he was invited to perform at All Tomorrow's Parties 2010, curated by [a=Matt Groening].

CHAOS CODE were originally a Baltimore, Maryland-based band that formed in 1997 and included Orion Sound Studios founder Mike Potter, bassist Phil Rous, flautist/guitarist Cliff Phelps, keyboardist Marty Saletta and drummer Mike Farmer. Farmer left the band early to found the prog-metal band ENCOMPASS. This was quickly followed by the exit of Potter, and following the band's debut release, they disbanded. Saletta went on to join the space rock band DARK AETHER PROJECT, while Phelps soon reformed CHAOS CODE with former CEREBRUS EFFECT drummer Patrick Gaffney and AVERTED VISION bassist Gary Curtis. The reformed band's second album, ""The Tragedy of Leaps and Bounds"" released in 2002, followed by their most recent studio release ""Propaganda"" in 2005.

The band's music ranges from symphonic to heavy rock to jazz/fusion, and is characterized by strident brass, and biting, sometimes apocalyptic lyrics. Heavy use of mellotron and flute provide a base of 70's-inspired symphonic sound into which the band infuses 80's-influenced post-punk lyrical and percussion sensibilities, and mystic multi-part epics with a decidedly modern tone. The sound spans many moods and can be compared at times to KING CRIMSON, early SALEM HILL, and mid-career JETHRO TULL at times.

CHAOS CODE are a must-have band on the archives due to their complex progressive arrangements, heavy use of keyboards and symphonic instrumentation, and borderline RIO-inspired lyrics."

It is very much forward-looking and contemporary featuring elements that stray into the realm of post-rock, world music, ambient music, math rock, space/psychedelic rock and contemporary hard rock."

They toured extensively and released the album [m=406634], a seminal piece of late ’60s music. Shortly afterwards, the band split to reform again suffering continuous personnel changes for a period of two and a half years (early 1970-mid 1972), releasing three more studio albums and one recorded live, with Robert Fripp as the only remaining member.

The new King Crimson that evolved in July 1972 (featuring ex-[a=Yes] drummer [a=Bill Bruford], ex-[a=Family (6)] and later [a=Asia (2)] bassist/vocalist [a=John Wetton] and other more transitory members) marked a turn toward a heavier progressive sound, with experimental and fusion overtones, climaxing in unique semi-improvisatory live performances. This core line-up carried on until mid-1974, when Fripp broke up the band (as he thought) for good.

In mid-1981, after a full 7 years, a newly-formed band including Robert Fripp, with [a=Adrian Belew] on vocals and guitar, [a=Tony Levin] on bass and Chapman Stick, and Bill Bruford on acoustic and electronic drums, changed its name from [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Discipline+(6)]Discipline[/url] to King Crimson.

In the hands of DGM, the King Crimson back catalogue (with most late additions available only on FLAC/MP3 format rather than on CD) grew enormously, making it one of the biggest for any rock group ever.

The next reincarnation of the band, jokingly dubbed the ""double duo"", omitted Bill Bruford and Tony Levin.

Centered around [a29855] (guitar) and [a254007] (bass), Ash Ra Tempel were rooted in a succession of beat and blues bands, including the Bluebirds, The Bomb Proofs, Bad Joe and [a207837]. The latter were transformed entirely when [a10360] from [a10343] met up with them, and formed Ash Ra Tempel. 

The trio of Göttsching / Enke / Schulze decided to abandon conventional composition and songwriting in favour of free-form improvising and developing a new musical language. As such, they became notorious for jams that could exceed 30 minutes (some such recordings can be found on [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1406291-The-Private-Tapes]The Private Tapes[/url] releases). Ash Ra Tempel went to Hamburg in March 1971 to record their debut, with the aid of top engineer [a40135]. A Krautrock twist on the space-rock music as pioneered by Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, with elements of both yet devoid of songs. One track per side: the power-drive storming ""Amboss"" and the shimmering timeless ""Traummaschine"". A yin-and-yang type concept that was followed on further albums. 

Schulze departed after the band's debut, with lots of other musicians passing through the group for their second album Schwingungen. The record had psychedelic blues numbers on one side, and a deep space trip on the other. The same concept appearing on the similarly balanced Seven Up collaboration with acid guru [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/21068-Dr-Timothy-Leary]Timothy Leary[/url]. Other related ""super-sessions"" were born out of this so-called [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1970698-The-Cosmic-Couriers]Cosmic Couriers[/url] collaboration idea included albums with [a256782], [a256792] and [a222379]. Schulze returned for the band's 4th album Join Inn, in 1973.

Hartmut soon left the band and abandoned music altogether, leaving Göttsching to keep the band-name going, with the duo project Starring Rosi, the cosmic guitar album Inventions For Electric Guitar, and the album New Age Of Earth, after which Ash Ra Tempel were re-branded as [a49639]. A later incarnation of the band was called [a5947028]. The members were [a29855], [a549], [a761608] and [a340847]. When Göttsching died in December 2022, the Ash Ra projects died with him."

After a landmark appearance at the Monterey Pop festival, their debut album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Are-You-Experienced/master/24497]Are You Experienced[/url] was released in September 1967. The album, and its 1968 successors - [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Axis-Bold-As-Love/master/24511]Axis: Bold As Love[/url] and the seminal blues-oriented developments of [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Electric-Ladyland/master/24535]Electric Ladyland[/url] - earned Hendrix international acclaim as a premier rock instrumentalist and innovator of his generation. A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

Biography:

On July 15th, 1998, Rob Morrison and Dave Warshaw moved to San Diego from Seattle and Los Angeles, respectively. On August 1st, 1998, Braden Diotte moved to San Diego, also from Los Angeles. On August 2nd, 1998, together with Dylan Scharf, a San Diego native, Tarantula Hawk was born. Over the next four months, a six-song set of music was written chronologically from start to finish. It was a ""concept"" that was written to illustrate the lifecycle of the Tarantula Hawk, but also illustrated the progression of a band getting comfortable with their own sound. On February 23rd, 1999, what would become Tarantula Hawk’s “Self-Titled Debut Album” was recorded. On March 1st, 1999, Rob Morrison left Tarantula Hawk to raise his son back in Seattle. The remaining band members were unsatisfied with the sound of Tarantula Hawk’s existing music without the attributes of Rob’s bass and noise accompaniment, and were not interested in trying to find anyone to replace him. Instead, each band member took on an auxiliary instrument and new songs were conceived.

The line-up became:
Dave Warshaw: drums, guitar, sampler
Dylan Scharf: keyboard, guitar
Braden Diotte: bass guitar, sampler/keys

Over the next four years Tarantula Hawk solidified itself as a force to be reckoned with within the underground music community, performing alongside such underground heavyweights as Neurosis, Crash Worship, High On Fire, Dystopia and The Locust. But a follow-up to their first album had yet to become a reality. Faced with the challenge of a second album, Tarantula Hawk quickly recognized that it wouldn’t be worth doing if they were to simply recreate their first album over again. There thus became a need for Tarantula Hawk to not only grow individually as musicians, but also to grow together as a band. And these things take time...

Finally, after one year of intense writing and arranging, Tarantula Hawk completed their second album in mid-2002. Although the album remained aesthetically congruent with their previous effort (opting for no album or song titles; artwork by Kevin Ross), this album leads the listener into a deeper chasm of interpretive and creative perception by combining the ""otherworldly"" musical imagery of their first album with a much more familiar element: human emotion. Using a darker palette, this album explores a cumulative void within the players, expressing emotions that, for them, are best conveyed using the medium of music."

Together with his brother, [a=Epic Soundtracks], [a=Nikki Sudden] formed what was to become [a=Swell Maps], releasing 4 singles and 2 albums on Rough Trade (UK) between 1977 and their break up in 1980. All these releases hit #1 in the UK Independent Charts. Swell Maps are remembered, particularly by similarly minded US based bands such as Sonic Youth, as pioneering exponents of the 'DIY Punk' school.
Sudden then began a solo career making two albums 'Waiting On Egypt' and 'The Bible Belt' before joining up with Birmingham guitarist, Dave Kusworth. The pair formed the Jacobites in 1983, going on to make two albums, 'Jacobites' and 'Robespierre’s Velvet Basement', the latter reaching No. 1 in the German Independent Charts. This tied in with their first German tour which lead to Sudden relocating there. 
When the Jacobites split in 1986, Sudden returned to his solo career with Creation Records, releasing five solo albums over the next five years: 'Texas', 'Dead Men Tell No Tales', 'Kiss You Kidnapped Charabanc' (with Rowland S. Howard), 'Groove' and a compilation, 'Back To The Coast'.
1990 found Sudden in Athens, Georgia, where sessions with [a=Peter Buck], [a=Mike Mills] and [a=Bill Berry (2)] from R.E.M. became the album 'The Jewel Thief' — later reissued as 'Liquor, Guns & Ammo'.
Kusworth and Sudden reformed The Jacobites in 1993, releasing three albums, 'Howling Good Times', 'Old Scarlett' and 'God Save Us Poor Sinners'. Their two original albums were reissued, as was a further compilation of rare tracks, 'Hawks Get Religion'. The band also released a limited edition, vinyl-only album, 'Kiss Of Life', in Germany, and a Spanish CD, 'Heart Of Hearts'.
In 1995, sessions in Chicago with members of the Chamber Strings and The Rosehips led to his seventh solo release 'Seven Lives Later'. This album featured musicians from The Jet Boys, The True Spirit, The Fatal Shore, Band Of Outsiders, Once Upon A Time, Vermooste Vløten, The Flaming Stars, Sonic Youth, Voodoo Witch, and The Jacobites.
Into the 2000's Sudden continued to tour extensively, playing around 100 shows per year, half with his backing band 'The Last Bandits' and half solo.
Nikki, with the Last Bandits, recorded his ninth solo release, 'Treasure Island', in England during summer 2002. Special guests include Ian McLagan (Small Faces, Faces), Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Anthony Thistlethwaite (Waterboys), Dave Kusworth (Jacobites) and Darrell Bath (Dogs D’Amour / Crybabys). The 'Treasure Island' release date was in 2004.
A retrospective, 'The Last Bandit (The Best Of Nikki Sudden)' was released by Glitterhouse Records in Europe, Wagging Dog Records in England, and Bomp Records in America, and features remastered and edited versions of  Sudden's most popular solo work.
Sudden's death in New York followed a number of solo performances in the USA after which a short European tour by The Jacobites had been scheduled. The first of these dates, on 29th March 2006 at London's '12 Bar Club', took place but was transformed into a tribute to Nikki Sudden's memory and featured a number of musicians with whom he had played.

[a=Frank Zappa] teamed with gigging R&B group 'The Soul Giants' in 1964. The band included vocalist [a=Ray Collins], bassist [a=Roy Estrada] and drummer [a=Jimmy Carl Black]. Zappa emerged as their creative leader and the band became 'The Mothers' (as in mother-f**kers = good musicians). After signing to [l=Verve Records] this was changed to 'The Mothers Of Invention' at the insistence of the label. Until Zappa founded his own label the appendage was usually added in mock deference and the band were usually referred to as 'The Mothers'.

Guitarist [a=Elliot Ingber] then joined and, for much of their seminal 1960's albums, the group also included woodwind player [a=Bunk Gardner], saxophonist [a=Motorhead Sherwood], keyboardist [a=Don Preston], multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian Underwood] and additional drummers [a=Billy Mundi] and [a=Art Tripp]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Freak Out!"" (1966), ""Absolutely Free"" and ""We're Only In It For The Money"" (1967), ""Cruising With Ruben & the Jets"" (1968) and ""Uncle Meat"" (1969).
During Zappa's jazz/classical rock period of 1969-1970, his works were augmented by violinists [a=Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris] and [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], percussionist [a=Ruth Underwood] and drummers [a=Aynsley Dunbar] and [a=John Guerin]. Most of these artists appeared on ""Uncle Meat"", ""Hot Rats"", ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"" and ""Burnt Weeny Sandwich"". 

From 1970-72, Zappa formed a new line-up with former [a48408] members [a=Flo & Eddie] and bassist [a=Jim Pons]. Preston, Underwood and Dunbar remained in the line-up, along with additional keyboardist [a=George Duke]. This line-up was disbanded, after Zappa was pushed from the stage by a fan in 1972. (He could not tour for the next year). Two more jazz rock albums, ""Waka Jawaka"" and ""The Grand Wazoo"", were recorded with much of the previous jazz-rock group including Preston, Ian and Ruth Underwood, Dunbar, Ponty, Guerin and Duke. Trumpeter [a=Sal Marquez] was also added. Zappa and the band went back to vocal rock songs with jazz elements in 1973 on ""Over-Nite Sensation"", then 1974's ""Apostrophe"" and 1975's ""One Size Fits All"". Much of the same band remained, along with new members [a2636463] (trombone), [a=Tom Fowler] (bass) and [a=Napoleon M. Brock] (saxophone). In 1975 Zappa called a halt to this backing band. By the late '70s an entirely new support band was formed, with only occasional participation from past members, including a re-appearance of [a=Captain Beefheart]. Beginning in the 80's, past 'Mothers' members Collins, Black, Gardner, Sherwood, Preston, Tom and Bruce Fowler occasionally played in a mock Zappa band, 'The Grandmothers'. In 1985 Zappa adroitly used 'The Mothers Of Prevention' in his assault on American censorship aspects of the music industry.

They did manage to land a deal and record an album's worth of material in Hollywood, but the album didn't come out at the time, after the commercial death of the 45. This unreleased material, like the single, combined sloppy garage band rock with self-consciously silly lyrics, like a garage group providing the soundtrack for a Z-grade horror-science fiction film.
Most of the Driving Stupid left Hollywood at the end of the summer of 1966 to return to college. The single, plus 17 unreleased tracks from their 1966 adventures, were issued in 2002 by Sundazed on Horror Asparagus Stories.

In his teenage years, he dabbled in music and did some modeling before a brief stint at University Of Texas. Eager to begin a career in Hip-Hop, he traveled to Florida, where he began working for Lou Pearlman.  It was there that he met Rich Cronin and Brian ""Brizz"" Gillis to form LFO.

LFO worked under Trans Continental Records/Logic Records releasing the singles Step By Step, (Sex U Up) The Way You Like It, Paul Revere, and If I Can't Have You while touring the world and opening for LL Cool J. Brizz left the group and was replaced by vocalist Harold ""Devin"" Lima. Shortly after, a radio DJ in Washington DC played the b-side to an LFO demo tape and their song ""Summer Girls"" became a chart-topping, platinum selling hit. Their debut album on Arista Records followed, releasing the hit singles Girl On TV, I Don't Wanna Kiss You Goodnight, and West Side Story.  Their Hip-Hop/R&B/Pop sound reached a wide fan base and the album sold over two and a half million copies.  They toured with Britney Spears, headlined Nickelodeon's All That Music Tour, made countless TV appearances, and had a cameo in the film Longshot. 

LFO's second album, Life Is Good, was released on J Records and found a hit with the single ""Every Other Time."" J Records stopped promoting the album shortly after.  Due to the lack of support from J Records and the changing landscape of pop music, LFO went on hiatus. 

Brad was often involved in the business side of LFO, which served as a stepping stone for him to start One Eleven Records.  The label offers many critically acclaimed albums by artists such as Rookie of the Year, Kiernan McMullan, and Devin Lima & the Cadbury Diesel. One of the first projects on the label was Brad's own solo album, entitled Amiland, released under the alias Sari.  

In 2009, LFO reunited for their Boys of Summer tour, playing venues that allowed them to arrange meet and greets with many of the groups' fans. After the tour, Brad and Devin collaborated on a a trip-hop project called The Xiles.  They demoed a handful of songs on their now-defunct YouTube channel and social media platforms. They quietly released a two-track holiday EP titled Hip Hop Christmas. It was re-released more broadly through LFO's website in 2018 with artwork and liner notes.  In 2010, LFO's Rich Cronin passed away from complications that stemmed from leukemia. 

In addition to running One Eleven Records, Brad found his calling working in the church, where his serves as Director of Operations & Music for a church in Celebration, Florida.

In 2016, 98 Degrees invited Brad and Devin to join them on stage for a TRL montage that they had as part of their show. During 98 Degrees' show in New York, Brad and Devin took the stage as LFO''s ""Summer Girls"" played. The crowd's overwhelming reaction prompted a tour manager to ask if Brad and Devin wanted to tour again. They initially turned the offer down, but after further consideration, they agreed to do it as a way to honor Rich Cronin and what LFO had achieved. 

The following year Brad and Devin released a new LFO single titled ""Perfect 10"" and embarked on a highly successful summer tour. They had scheduled dates for a new leg of the tour and booked the travel when Devin was diagnosed with stage 4 adrenal cancer. The tour was put on hold and he passed away a little over a year later. 

In 2019, Fischetti began hosting the Pop 2000 Tour, which features artists such as O-Town, Aaron Carter, and Ryan Cabrera as a way to honor Rich, Devin, and the LFO legacy. He takes the stage with O-Town to perform an LFO medley, which is constantly a highlight of the evening."

Sean McCarthy's first notable band appearance was in 1994 as guitarist for Milkmoney, seemingly a forerunner to the rock sub-genre of slowcore that gained popularity as the decade progressed. His brother Dan drummed for Dagobah, whose sound was an instrumentally heavy marriage of progressive rock and hardcore. By 1996, Sean founded The Television Set with Tina McCarthy (at the time Tina Helms) making her debut on bass, and this band eventually transformed into Helms when Dan replaced their drummer. There was one name stop along the way as The Swimmer. This moniker was dumped when a major label band released a record under a similar name. The Swimmer eventually became the title of their 2000 debut album on Kimchee Records, released following an EP shared with Victory at Sea. A second full-length, McCarthy, had a November 2002 release.

The Helms experience often consists of equal amounts delicacy and power. The band expertly veers from softer hypnotic passages into precipitous cacophony, all the while maintaining total navigational control. Accompanying these sonic vestments is what appears on first listen to be somewhat inconsequential lyric imagery using the ephemera of modern-day culture. Closer attention can lead one to the big picture truths such fables portend. Helms' musical narrative, although marinated in that post-something aural tradition, is original and always compelling."

The group has played with a diverse range of acts such as Beck, the Boredoms, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, Faith No More, Jad Fair, and Sun City Girls.
Befuddled attempts to label the band bring comparisons to Frank Zappa, Pere Ubu, and Captain Beefheart, but they somehow fall short of the carnival of sights, smells and sounds that is Three Day Stubble. Brut cologne, pyroflatulance, dijiridoos, trombone, platform shoes, trumpet, drool, bizarre keyboards, and teeny tiny drumkit swirl in a thick stew of guitars peppered with Donald's inimitable vocal stylings.
Three Day Stubble shows the glory and horror of white American culture turned inward upon itself, and the incestual expulsive ramifications of our democratic free society. Three Day Stubble's hobby is showing the struggle of backward egos from a relatively tame society, that would rather turn away from looking at their problems and delude themselves while acting out the eccentric behavior brought about by such ignorance. Stubble exposes this ""bubble life,"" never acknowledged by society, through music, dancing, and other entertainment. These guys are making way to allow and encourage the acceptance of individual expression and creativity, no matter how secret or personal.
The band refers to its music as 'nerd rock,' but that fails to capture the depth and scope of Three Day Stubble's strangeness. The impression begins with the band's attire, such as it is: eye -bendingly bad combinations of thrift store relics from the 70's that make David Lindley look like a GQ model. The nerd reference might strike closer with the musicians' earnestly goofy expressions. Still these guys make Bill Murray's ultimate ""Saturday Night Live"" nerd, Todd de la Muca, seem socially adept.
Musically Three Day Stubble is similarly unique. Try to imagine a hybrid of Captain Beefheart's advanced rythmic/harmonic weaves, the naivete and inadvertant dadaisms of the Shaggs, and the ingratiating enthusiasm of, say, Kukla, Fran and Ollie. Still not close."

He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone.

Known as ""Van the Man"" by his fans, Morrison started his musical career as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, penning their seminal 1964 hit ""Gloria"". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career. (In 1966 he moved to the USA, first to New York City. In 1968 he lived 9 months in Cambridge near Boston. Early Autumn 1968, he recorded Astral Weeks in New York, then moving to Woodstock. In the spring of 1971 he moved to California, settling in the leafy Marin County town of Fairfax, where he built his own Caledonia Studios. Morrison has moved house a lot. By 1977 he's living in Brentwood near Los Angeles, later it's Sausalito, ... Morrison would revisit Ireland and the UK, e.g. buying a house in Bath, England.)

Van Morrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2000, Morrison ranked #25 on American cable music channel VH1's list of its 100 greatest artists of rock and roll, and in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Van Morrison 42nd on their list of The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Paste Magazine ranked him 20th in their list of 100 Greatest Living Songwriters in 2006 and Q Magazine ranked him 22nd on their list of 100 Greatest Singers in April 2007."

93980,1111949,1809997,USA & Europe,Humble Pie,Back On Track,2002,0.0,9,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Arena Rock', 'Classic Rock']","Steve Marriott formed Humble Pie in 1968 with Greg Ridley, Peter Frampton and Jerry Shirley. Their debut single ""Natural Born Bugie"" became a  hit in the UK Singles Chart and was  followed by the album As Safe As Yesterday Is, which rose to number sixteen in the UK album charts. Their second album, Town and Country was released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of USA. This album featured a more acoustic sound and songs written by all four members.

During 1970 Humble Pie switched to A&M Records who released  the album Humble Pie, later that year which alternated between progressive rock and hard rock. In 1971 A&M released Rock On, and a simultaneous release of a Humble Pie concert recorded at the Fillmore East New York, entitled Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore. Rock On and Performance both went gold and the loud and epic ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" was an FM radio hit in the USA, propelling the album up the charts. 

Frampton left after Rockin' the Fillmore was recorded and was replaced by Dave ""Clem"" Clempson. Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasizing Marriott's blues and soul roots. They recorded the album Smokin', along with two singles ""Hot 'n' Nasty"" and ""30 Days in the Hole"". It was the band's most commercially successful record and reached #6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. A&M then realeased Lost and Found which combined two previous  albums as one. Looking for a more authentic R&B sound, Marriott hired three female backing singers, The Blackberries and the more focused Thunderbox was released in 1974 and Street Rats a year later. In 1975, joined by keyboardist Tim Hinkley, Humble Pie played a Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.

During 1979 Steve Marriott revived Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley, adding Bobby Tench vocalist and guitarist from The Jeff Beck Group and American bassist Anthony ""Sooty"" Jones. Fool for a pretty face proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records. They recorded the album On to Victory which was released in 1980 . Humble Pie toured USA as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill and recorded the album Go for the Throat. At the beginning of this tour Marriott crushed his hand, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a duodenal ulcer forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates. Soon afterwards this line up disbanded.

Drummer Jerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1989 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley, Shirley was the only original performing member. The band began performing concerts and was based in Cleveland, Ohio USA. This time the line up included vocalist Charlie Huhn, who also played lead and rhythm guitar. While Huhn and Shirley were the only permanent members of the group several other musicians appeared from time to time including Wally Stocker formerly of Rod Stewart's band and Cleveland guitarist Alan Greene. They developed a strong reputation as a live act in USA but never released any official studio recordings. They  appeared in the line-up at the Woodstock Festival's 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was broadcast live on national television in the United States and other countries. 

During 1991 when it had appeared that a reunion featuring Frampton and Marriott would happen, Shirley put Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley on hold. After Marriott's death Shirley revived his band which dissolved in 1999. He re-formed Humble Pie again in 2001 with a line up including the original bass player Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench and a new rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell. They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album Back on Track, which comprised new songs and was released by Sanctuary in 2002. A brief tour of UK and Germany with Company of Snakes followed. 

Humble Pie appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the London Astoria during 2001. The concert featured a one of re-union line up of Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley. 

Shirley's 2001 version of the band dissolved in 2002 when Greg Ridley fell ill."
30724,77693,393718,US,Santana,Shaman,2002,75.45,16,"['Album', 'Enhanced']",['Rock'],"['Blues Rock', 'Classic Rock']","American latin-rock group, formed in the late 1960s, led by guitarist [a=Carlos Santana]. They first came to a wider public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. This initial exposure made their first eponymous self-titled album a hit at the time, followed by the next two releases ""Abraxas"" (1970) and ""Santana III"" (1971) all with Columbia, the first record company that signed the band. 

""Caravanserai"" from 1972 marked the start of a new, more Jazz oriented chapter in Santana's career, as the band now moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. ""Welcome"" from 1973 and the 1974 ""Borboletta"" and ""Lotus"" releases (the latter a triple live album) are most remarkable from that period. 

Over the next decades, lineup changes were common, the music at times evolved more commercially and Pop oriented although never loosing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor for their 1992's ""Milagro"" album and the subsequent releases, until Clive Davis signed the group to Arista in 1998, with whom they achieved their greatest commercial and critical success: Santana won a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000 for the 1999 ""Supernatural"" album (which also earned them their first No. 1 hit ""Smooth""). 

In 1994, Santana played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after the band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored. In 2016 they released [m986309], a studio album that reunites the early ’70s lineup and signifies the first time in 45 years – since 1971’s multi-platinum classic Santana III – that the quintet has recorded together. Santana again played at Bethel New York for the Woodstock 50th anniversary.

The 2010 released collection of classic rock covers ""Guitar Heaven"" turned out to be their last album for Arista. ""Shape Shifter"", the band's 2012 album, was released on their Sony-distributed imprint Starfaith. With the 2014 release of ""Corazón"", Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on. Santana has signed with Concord since 2018 and released the Narada Michael Walden-produced EP ""In Search of the Mona Lisa"" and the full-length album ""Africa Speaks"" produced by Rick Rubin in 2019."

Biography:

On July 15th, 1998, Rob Morrison and Dave Warshaw moved to San Diego from Seattle and Los Angeles, respectively. On August 1st, 1998, Braden Diotte moved to San Diego, also from Los Angeles. On August 2nd, 1998, together with Dylan Scharf, a San Diego native, Tarantula Hawk was born. Over the next four months, a six-song set of music was written chronologically from start to finish. It was a ""concept"" that was written to illustrate the lifecycle of the Tarantula Hawk, but also illustrated the progression of a band getting comfortable with their own sound. On February 23rd, 1999, what would become Tarantula Hawk’s “Self-Titled Debut Album” was recorded. On March 1st, 1999, Rob Morrison left Tarantula Hawk to raise his son back in Seattle. The remaining band members were unsatisfied with the sound of Tarantula Hawk’s existing music without the attributes of Rob’s bass and noise accompaniment, and were not interested in trying to find anyone to replace him. Instead, each band member took on an auxiliary instrument and new songs were conceived.

The line-up became:
Dave Warshaw: drums, guitar, sampler
Dylan Scharf: keyboard, guitar
Braden Diotte: bass guitar, sampler/keys

Over the next four years Tarantula Hawk solidified itself as a force to be reckoned with within the underground music community, performing alongside such underground heavyweights as Neurosis, Crash Worship, High On Fire, Dystopia and The Locust. But a follow-up to their first album had yet to become a reality. Faced with the challenge of a second album, Tarantula Hawk quickly recognized that it wouldn’t be worth doing if they were to simply recreate their first album over again. There thus became a need for Tarantula Hawk to not only grow individually as musicians, but also to grow together as a band. And these things take time...

Finally, after one year of intense writing and arranging, Tarantula Hawk completed their second album in mid-2002. Although the album remained aesthetically congruent with their previous effort (opting for no album or song titles; artwork by Kevin Ross), this album leads the listener into a deeper chasm of interpretive and creative perception by combining the ""otherworldly"" musical imagery of their first album with a much more familiar element: human emotion. Using a darker palette, this album explores a cumulative void within the players, expressing emotions that, for them, are best conveyed using the medium of music."

Singer/guitarist John Tran (stage name Johnee Trash/John E. Trash), singer/guitarist Ian ""Slur"" Cone, and drummer Bob ""Stress"" Herco met while classmates at El Modena High School in Orange, and formed Home Grown shortly after graduating. Adding singer/bassist Adam ""Adumb"" Lohrbach (who had attended Estancia High School in nearby Costa Mesa), they released their debut 7"" EP [i]Smoking Is Cool[/i] in 1994 on Insta-Noise Records. Their first full-length album, [i]That's Business[/i], was released in 1995 on local label Liberation Records. It was given an overseas release in Europe and Sweden in 1996 by Burning Heart Records, who also released their EP [i]Wusappaning?![/i] the same year (a U.S. release of the EP came in 1998 on Cargo Music/Grilled Cheese). The band's early sound was heavily influenced by ska-punk, leading to their inclusion on a number of punk- and ska-themed compilations.

Home Grown signed to major label Outpost Recordings, who released their second album, [i]Act Your Age[/i] (1998). A new recording of the [i]That's Business[/i] song ""Surfer Girl"" was released as the album's single. Cone left the band after the album's release, and was replaced by Justin Poyser. That December, Herco had surgery to remove a brain tumor. He underwent rehabilitation, was able to tour, and played on the 1999 EP [i]EP Phone Home[/i], released on Fueled By Ramen. However, he did not play on Home Grown's 2000 split EP with [a=Limbeck] on Utility Records, titled [i]Connection[/i] (Tran played drums on one track, while Poyser played on the other two). He left the band that September, citing complications from his surgery. Darren Reynolds of [a=Longfellow] was recruited to fill in for a tour that began the following month. A few dates into the tour, Poyser quit the group over personal differences, reducing them to a trio. Reynolds' membership became permanent by early 2001, but Outpost Recordings folded, leaving the band without a recording contract.

In June 2001 Home Grown signed with Drive Thru Records, who released their 2002 album [i]Kings Of Pop[/i], which found them leaning fully into a pop punk sound. Shortly after its release, guitarist Dan Hammond (of This Camero) joined the band to play on that summer's Warped Tour, eventually becoming a full time member. [i]Kings Of Pop[/i] was supported by a single and music video for ""You're Not Alone"" and additional videos for ""Kiss Me, Diss Me"" and ""I Love You, Not"". The EP [i]When It All Comes Down[/i] followed in 2004, showing the band maturing musically and lyrically. Lohrbach left Home Grown in April 2005, going on to co-found [a=New Years Day]. Home Grown continued as a live act, bringing in bassist Ted Vega, but went on indefinite hiatus in 2006.

Knockout has put out a few recordings themselves and have recently released a 9-song CD on Mr. Good Records titled, ""Driven to Distraction"". After their first release, they toured heavily with many local bands, mainly 5o4plan, and made very good friends along the way, such as Fall Out Boy. They even introduced Fall Out Boy to Sean O'Keefe who later recorded and produced their break-through album, ""Take This To Your Grave"" Where they even name-dropped KO in the ""thank you"" section as ""their brothers in metal."" Then in October 2002, they release their full length CD ""Searching for Solid Ground"" which contains 13 tracks that'll keep you rocking until that unwanted pregnancy is aborted. ""Searching for Solid Ground"" was released by their new label they signed with, Fearless Records.

Then later in July '02, Knockout lost a crucial member when TJ decided to quit the band, and go to pursue other projects. No fear though, the Chicago pop-punkers added one of their original members in Chris Tag, the bassist. After the new addition, Knockout toured like no tomorrow going countlessly around the US, with bands like Near Miss, Anti-Freeze, and yet again 5o4plan. But as the months went by, interturmoil between the band came out about the music and the writing. To make things worse Chris Tag quit again, so the band brought in John Regan to replace him at the four strings. With new members the band tried to patch things up, but to no avail. Band member's began quitting over arguments over the music and De'Mar and John sided and quit. Without a half the band, Jeff brought in his friend Spencer Johnson to play bass and Mark Rhoades, who was the former drummer of another Windy City band, Starstruck.

3589494,0,9404121,US,The Corevares,The Corevares,2002,38.58,13,['Album'],['Rock'],['Punk'],"The Corevares were an old-school Rustbelt power-pop punk band formed in Toledo, Ohio in early 1997. Like a lot of local bands at the time, The Corevares came together from bits and pieces of earlier, less-well-known outfits, including Black Belt Jones, [a3559469], [a3589491] and Grand Mal.

The band originally consisted of Lead Guitarist Aaron Urbanski, Bassist Jimmy “Jazz” Izbinski, Lead Singer/Guitarist Mic Graves and Drummer Jay “Scrap” Nevers. With their hooky original tunes, sloppily entertaining, high-energy performances and willingness to play anywhere to anyone, The Corevares rapidly became established on the local scene and formed a tight bond with their “Brother Band” [a3589472], as well as Detroit’s [a1763412] (which Featured Ken Haas later of Reverend Guitar fame), and Columbus Ohio’s [a2557238].

The Corevares signed with local label [l140208] and began recording their CD debut in late 1997. They continued to play dozens of gigs around Toledo and the Tri-State area, and rose in popularity throughout 1998. The band also continued to work on their CD, though production delays and band infighting doomed the project to be shelved until it was later salvaged by Graves.

In late 1999, singer Mic Graves departed The United States for a job that took him to Tokyo, Japan. Singer/Guitarist Ken Haas of Culture Bandits stepped in as a replacement, but the new configuration was short-lived as the then-current lineup ultimately split into the Punk-a-billy Four On the Floor, and the Kid Rock-inspired Metal Rap outfit, [a2121896].

The original Corevares lineup reunited with Graves for one wild show in December 2001, but then went silent again until late 2002, when former Lazy American Workers drummer Kev stepped in for the reluctant Scrap. Days after the shocking, untimely death of Graves' hero, Joe Strummer (whom he'd met in Japan the year before) The Corevares played a triumphant tribute-themed show in downtown Toledo, featuring a nearly-spontaneous cover of The Clash’s “White Riot”. 
Days later, the rejuvenated lineup went into the studio to record new material that Graves and Urbanski had written in the interim. The sessions, which were high and manic with the juices of inspiration flowing like never before, continued intermittently through the summer of 2003 and 2004, along with a few more reunion concerts. However, production delays related to a singer and primary songwriter living on the other side of the planet, some unforgivable gross negligence by the Audiomatrix studio in Toledo, and more ugly studio infighting led to the 'Unfortunate Sons' CD being delayed until 2006.

Although singer Mic Graves finally returned to resettle in the Toledo area a short while later, one or two band members unfortunately became increasingly reluctant to participate in any more reunions, and the more mature second studio effort from The Corevares was left to gather dust in cardboard boxes.

In 2010, inspired by the new Toledo Hockey Team, The Walleye, the Unfortunate Sons-era lineup reformed and teamed up with The Cherub Ballroom studio in Toledo to record an unofficial fight song for The Walleye titled “Home Ice.” The tune was a reworking of an earlier instrumental by Aaron and Jimmy with new lyrics by Mic Graves. Since that time, Kev and Mic have continued to work together in [a4625618], a folky traditional ‘beer band,’ featuring veteran Lead Guitarist/Cherub Ballroom purveyor [a4589281] and others. Urbanski and Izbinski, who were very active in the local music scene in the immediate post-Corevares era seem to have largely retired.

Like earlier punk rock heroes in other places and eras, The Corevares came along at a time when punk music was on the upswing in their part of middle America, and they left a mark on their local scene. Years have passed and people have seemingly forgotten, but the music survives. It remains to be seen whether The Corevares have any future, but the band members can be proud of what they accomplished while the brotherhood lasted."

The band played their first show on Mother's Day in 1993 and after a few lineup changes, were composed of Rubio Cisneros on drums, Mitch on bass, Tony Avitia on guitar, and Butch Klotz on vocals. Shortly after releasing their first demo, Mitch left the Houston area to get married. He was replaced by Jeff, before Rubio took over the bass role. Damon DeLaPaz filled in the drum position, and this lineup recording the self titled 1994 demo, along with the group's first EP, Elementary School Love, that same year. Ativia then left the group to start I-45 and after a few temporary guitarists, Chris LaForge of I-End Result picked up as their official guitarist. This lineup remained stable during their most active period in the mid to late 90s. Touring Houston, Dallas, and Austin, 30 Foot Fall's popularity grew; they would later become openers for larger bands such as Screeching Weasel and Sum-41 among others.

In 1995, on Fuzzgun Records, they released their first studio album Divided We Stand. In 1996 they also released their second EP, Junior High Sucked. After hearing a demo, Bob Becker of Fearless Records signed 30 Foot Fall to a record deal and in 1997 produced their next album Acme-143.

The band toured extensively alongside other notable bands such as Bigwig and Diesel Boy. They self released the EP Cartoons in 1998. Two of the three songs from Cartoons were included on their next album. At this time, DeLaPaz received a record deal offer with MCA Records for his other band Fenix*TX and moved to California. Brian Davis of Middlefinger was brought in to replace him.

In 1999, the band released their most successful album, Ever Revolving, Never Evolving, on Nitro Records. The release was followed by numerous shows including a tour with The Vandals.[2] Despite being at the height of their popularity, 30footFALL went on hiatus after the conclusion of their 1999 tour, citing the need to spend more time with family. Chris LaForge left the band at this time to seek other musical ventures. Jason Davis, brother of drummer Brian Davis) and formerly of Middlefinger, was brought on to play guitar when they resumed playing locally in spring of 2000. This line-up recorded The Doppler Effect in 2002. At this time, 30footFALL chose not to tour for the new album. Instead, the band chose to play occasional Houston/Dallas/Austin shows and their annual 30footFALL Christmas show at Fitzgerald's in Houston, TX. In 2003, with Chris LaForge back in the band, they released 10yearsandstillFALLING, a live album which documents their ten years as a band.

At their 2005 Christmas Show, Klotz announced that he would be moving to Virginia, ending his 12 years in the Houston punk scene.

On December 25, 2010, at their 16th annual Christmas Show, the band self-released their Jesus, Elvis, and Richard Petty EP, which was their first studio release since 2002's The Doppler Effect. In 2012, 30footFALL were featured in When We Ruled H-Town, which documents Houston punk bands and their rise to popularity in the 1990s.

Chris LaForge passed away on May 29th, 2017. He was replaced by Skeleton Dick guitarist Chris Vasquez. In October, 30footFALL released Champion Song, the final recording to feature LaForge on guitar.

Jason Davis left the band in 2023, returning 30footFALL to a four piece. The group released their first EP in 13 years, National Treasure...And Other LaForgeries in March 2024."

The original members performed on the first several releases and supported early records with many tours along the US east coast between 1997-2001, with subsequent releases featuring various artists and touring musicians. Notable was Tim Sostak, who was a roadie on many Fux tours from 1998-1999. Sostak took over as bass player after West left the band in early 2000. The Fux performed to a sold-out show at the renowned Fireside Bowl with Anti-Flag in 1999, in addition to many famous, now defunct venues, such as CBGB's in NYC. The Fux were also known for being an early staple act at Lehigh Valley, PA venues during the era of the independent music renaissance centered around the venues, Lehigh University, Second Avenue in Bethlehem, PA, and the Arch Street Hotel in Catasauqua, PA in the late 1990's-early 2000's. Many musicians that played and toured with the Fux also performed with acclaimed acts, such as drummer, David Ferrara, who toured with the Fux in the summer of 1998 throughout the southern US, and is known for touring with the iconic Herman and the Hermits. Johnny Loftus, from the well-known Catasauqua, PA band, the Clap, played bass with the Fux in 2000 during a southern US tour, moonlighting with the Fux while also playing with his band, the Clap, on the same tour. The Clap and the Fux played locally on the same bill often and collaborated on many short tours throughout the northeast and mid-west. The Fux also went on to tour in the United Kingdom and Europe in 2001. Matt Roman remained the Fux lead singer and guitarist throughout the tenure of the band that continued to perform through 2019 with various iterations of musicians."

They released three EPs before losing their keyboardist/backing vocalist, then signed to Kung Fu Records and released two studio albums with additional lineup changes before breaking up in 2005. The band was re-launched in 2015 by some of the original members and has since released one studio album on Alternative Tentacles.

Tsunami Bomb was formed in 1998 by bassist Dominic Davi and singer Kristin McRory (both ex-[a=Headboard]), with keyboardist/backing vocalist Oobliette Sparks and guitarist Tim Chaddick. Gabe Lindeman played drums with them but could not commit to joining the band permanently. McRory and Chaddick left later that year, and by early 1999 the lineup was rounded out with the addition of singer Emily Whitehurst (aka Agent M) and guitarist Brian Plink (both ex-[a=Plinky]), with drummer Robert Read. Their first release was the 'B-Movie Queens' split EP with Plinky (Plinky's only release). Read was replaced by Lindeman, and this lineup released two EPs, 'Mayhem On The High Seas' (1999) and 'The Invasion From Within!' (2001). Plink left and was replaced by Mike Griffen, while Sparks left and was not replaced.

Tsunami Bomb signed to Kung Fu Records and released their first album, 'The Ultimate Escape' (2002). Davi was asked to leave the band (he went on to [a=Love Equals Death]) and was replaced by Matt McKenzie. This lineup released 'The Definitive Act' (2004). Griffen left and was replaced by Jay Northington, but Tsunami Bomb broke up in 2005. Whitehurst and McKenzie formed [a=The Action Design], while Lindeman and Northington formed [a=Nothington].

In 2015, Davi, Sparks, Lindeman, and Plink re-formed Tsunami Bomb with new singer Kate Jacobi to support the release of 'Trust No One', a compilation of their early EPs. Plink left in 2016, and Chris LaForge filled in until permanent guitarist Andy Pohl joined. The new lineup began releasing new material, and signed to Alternative Tentacles for a new studio album, 'The Spine That Binds' (2019)."

17479,58431,392808,US,Bad Religion,The Process Of Belief,2002,36.75,14,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Punk', 'Melodic Hardcore']","Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

Sammy had made a name for himself in the local hard-core scene as a promoter and was looking to start his own band when he heard that a group of musicians were seeking a vocalist.

Punk band from Boston, MA, formed in 1996 by Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar) and Mike McColgan (vocals).  The band is known for its Oi!/punk sound, its frequent covers of Irish standards, and lyrics which often focus on unions and working class ethics and concerns.  In 1998, the band signed to [l=Hellcat Records], a label run by members of [a=Rancid] and connected to [l=Epitaph Records].  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.  The split was amicable and McColgan would return to music a few years later, fronting the [a=Street Dogs].  He was replaced by Al Barr.  Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old [a=Woody Guthrie] poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".  It remains perhaps their best-known song.

In 2007, the Dropkick Murphys formed their own record label, Born & Bred Records, to release their material.

The band was formed in South Jersey around the nucleus of Ryan Ogren on lead vocals and guitar and Matt Emburgia on lead and rhythm guitars. The two had been playing in various bands together since the 8th grade and adopted the name Don't Look Down when the in early '98 around the same time bassist Jesse Rendell joined the fold. The members had become regulars at local punk shows, having been exposed to the music years earlier through their involvement in the surf scene and shared the common goal of making this band their life, no matter how difficult a task this might represent. 

By late 2000 the band had toured around the entire country a couple of times and was ready to go back into the studio to record their new material. The result was a four song demo that while admittedly ""lo-fi"" showed enormous growth in their writing and their ability to self produce their own music. It was this demo that prompted New York based indie record label Iguana Records to sign the band. "

Bio from defunct website  (http://www.lifeisabuse.com/nigel/)  :

Biography:

Our story begins with 6 young men who were all college buddies, and members of the fraternity ALPHA KI COCK. The fraternity already had a reputation as being the WORST at Stanford University before these guys enrolled, and when they finally did, the whole campus was reeking of testosterone, stale beer, and dirt weed. One day our heroes decided to head down to Spring Break in Palms Springs, for some pre-summer party action. On their way home, they got lost in the desert, searching for a gas station. This is where their cosmic encounter began that put them on their path today. Call it Kismet, call is psycho kinesis,. all that is known is that meeting Rick the Desert Dick changed their lives forever. They now had a purpose, a reason to exist.

Soon after, the dudes dropped out of college and moved to the not so peaceful streets of San Francisco. After a few years saving money by doing “odd jobs” aka working for crooked pimps and political leaders, our boys of summer were able to acquire musical instruments, and with time and patience, they learned to master them as well. And soon that cosmic light was shining and three words fell from the lips of god, NIGEL PEPPER COCK.

And so begins their illustrious career wreaking havoc on the Western Hemisphere. Just one year after attaining their mystical powers, the name Nigel Pepper Cock has gained infamy the world over. Nigel’s first release “Fresh White Reeboks Kickin’ Your Ass”, has swept across the nation like a wildfire.. out of control!! With a major multi-album record deal with the extreme punk and metal label LIFE IS ABUSE, orders for the newest full length “The New Way” have been pouring in. Our heroes returned from a tour of the greater United States and have been preaching the gospel of Rick, the Desert Dick to all the lonely aching souls in America. Lock up your children, NIGEL is HERE!!"

For the last five years they have performed live as often as possible creating their fanbase. Their crowds grew steadily and they began packing clubs with people who had been searching for this ingenious form of melodic-hardcore. They released their self-produced debut demo in February of 1999 and sold hundreds of copies at their shows. Since then their fan base has grown rapidly as their words spread quickly through the fed up youths across the country. Their explosive live show caught the attention of Michigan-based Medea Records and they were quickly signed. Label backing seemed to be all the band needed to move forward. With a much more mature sound the band released their debut album, (the lessons of life's brutality become) Guides to Action, for the label in July of 2002, meeting with much praise from fans of punk and metal alike. The album went on to chart very well on the radio and i-defy found themselves ranked amongst high-profile bands on much bigger labels. As a result, they found themselves sharing the stage with bands like Dead to Fall and Fordirelifesake, exposing their music to a multitude of fans. More recently, i-defy contributed a song to the second volume of the 'Too Legit for the Pit' compilations, released worldwide on Radical Records in summer 2004"
165426,217246,1431104,US,Reel Big Fish,Cheer Up!,2002,62.45,18,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Ska', 'Punk']","A ska-punk band from Huntington Beach, California. Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

3828965,0,8177193,US,Jank 1000,Bruised But Not Beaten,2002,0.0,12,"['AAC', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Pop Punk'],"Jank 1000 was a suburban pop punk band originally formed in late 1998, in the suburbs of Omaha, NE. The band's original lineup consisted of [a=Matty Lewis] on lead vocals and guitar, bassist Danny Isgro and drummer Jake Horrocks. The band were known for their combined catchy, hook filled songs with clever and intelligent lyrics.

Jank 1000 initially started as a garage band in 1997 called ""Formula One"". Lewis and his two previous bandmates (Mike Haddock and Chris Bowen) played primarily at frat parties and street dances, almost always for free. However, with his bassist and drummer heading for college that summer, Lewis looked to regroup. He hooked up with Bellevue University students Jake Harrocks and Danny Isgro in the fall of 1998 and Jank 1000 was officially born. The three began writing songs and playing various house parties until their public debut on December 27th, 1998. When asked about the meaning of the band's name, Lewis stated in an interview from 1999 ""It doesn't mean anything really. Most people feel it is what kids say after their skateboard runs have been stopped by the cops. They say, 'Man…that's Jank!"" It basiclly means whatever you want it to mean. Nonsense really. It's just a fun, made-up word""

Jank 1000's self-made debut EP entitled ""[r=8176924]"" was entrenched on the Homers® Local music top 10 upon it's release in October of 1999. The first single from the EP, entitled Misty 540° (referring to a difficult snowboarding/skateboarding move) became an instant hit on local alternative radio stations KIWR and KTNP, receiving extensive radio airplay.  The trio quickly gained a small following and became the front runners in the Nebraska punk scene. Often described as ""Raw, poppy- punk rock on speed"", Jank 1000 were known to hit an almost unthinkable 6th gear with their audiences. Their squeeky-clean image, anti-drug stance and no cursing policy assured them of audiences far beyond the norm for typical punk music. Lewis stated in a 1999 interview, ""It's all about getting up on stage and feeling the music. We just grab out instruments and play as hard and as fast as we can. That's pretty much it"".

In the year 2000, after the release of their first independent full-length CD ""[r=8176990]"", Jank 1000 gained recognition from The Album Network as a Regional Best Seller. Both of the band's releases continued to spend several months atop the local album chart in Omaha. The band quickly built a strong following, and immediately became a force in the Omaha-area punk scene.The band continued touring and energizing crowds with their powerful live shows, playing with major national bands such as [a=The Ataris], [a=ALL], [a=Rx Bandits], [a=The Hippos], [a=The Impossibles], [a=Sugarcult], and [a=Catch 22], and touring around the Midwest area.

In 2001, Jank 1000 grabbed the attention of Singerman Entertainment whose roster included [a=Zebrahead], [a=The Misfits], [a=Motörhead], and [a=Dokken]. After replacing Horrocks with Albert Kurniawan, Jank 1000 soon broke out of the Midwest and made their way to take on the Southern California punk scene. The band quickly gained popularity from fans in So-Cal, Neveda, and Arizona after playing clubs and venues to warm reviews. The band even played selective spots on the 2002 Vans Warped Tour. In May of 2002, booked, funded, and supported entirely by themselves, Jank 1000 embarked on a national tour hitting 14 states spanning from LA to NY.

Shortly afterwards the band took a couple months off to write new material and re-write old songs for their second LP ""[r=8177193]"". Unfortunately due to the strains of writing, producing and recording the new material the band split up in 2003 and the three members went their sepeate ways, leaving Jank 1000 officially extinct.

Albert Kurniawan went on to play and sing in the Omaha based band Go! Motion and since 2005, [a=Matty Lewis] has been enjoying a successful career with [a=Zebrahead]."

Originally a crossover band, their early recordings combined elements of both hardcore punk and metal. The band was formed by guitarist and vocalist Bill Reeves, formerly of the bands Suburban Nightmare and Miscarriage, and Jerry “DJ” Lawrence, previously of death metal group Skeletal Earth. They recruited bassist Charles Paul Jordan following the breakup of his punk band, Coup d’ Etat. After Random Conflict’s first show, Charles Paul was replaced on bass by Dave Nichols.

In late 1988, the trio released their debut seven-song cassette, Defying the Megadread, a crude, yet powerful 2-track, reel-to-reel recording of signature songs like “Cyanide Nazi Race” and “Grave Desires.” Early copies of this EP included a cover of the song “Halloween” as an uncredited bonus track.  

Random Conflict went through significant lineup changes over the next several months. They added Steve Shoemaker as a second guitar player, Larry Horgan replaced Dave on bass and Jay Stephens replaced Jerry on drums. By the summer of 1990, the four-piece released the Psychotronic Mecca cassette, six songs of doomy, fuzzed out trash metal including the popular “Atrocity Manifesto.” The group made two failed attempts at a follow up in 1990 (The Gay Street Demos and The Sock Tape), but only the song “The Process of Chronological Disruption” was released as part of the Angry Kids Unite! 1991 compilation cassette on Peer Pressure Productions. Larry left the band in 1990 and was replaced on bass by Rob Moore, and in the spring of 1991, drummer Ray York was added to the band as Jay and Steve left to form the band Scoff.

In August 1991, the new Random Conflict lineup released Shadows of Existence, a three song 7” record on Peer Pressure Productions. A year later those songs would appear as bonus tracks on the CD version of Internal Visions, a straight-ahead metal album also on Peer Pressure Productions. Internal Visions featured remakes of a few older songs as well as new material like the feminist “Object,” the haunting instrumental “Seconds Underwater” and the Kiss inspired “Brainwashed.”  

Creative and personal tensions between Rob and Ray following the Internal Visions tour culminated in a fistfight between the two leaving Ray hospitalized. Bill and Rob tried unsuccessfully to find a new drummer over the next several months, but eventually they agreed to abandon Random Conflict in the summer of 1993.

In the spring of 1996 Bill met Brian Murphree, who had been playing bass with Jerry in the band Mozaik. Jerry suggested that he and Bill reform Random Conflict for a few shows with Brian filling in on bass. The reunion of the band was so popular that the trio quickly focused on writing new songs, and by August they released the Blown Fuse cassette, quickly followed by a split 7” record with the Birmingham, Alabama band, Anti-Crisis, on Pun Crock Records. The cassette When We Do Right No One Remembers, When We Do Wrong No One Forgets followed two years later.

In September 1999, Random Conflict released their second CD, New World Order, a street punk/Oi! influenced album that included fan favorites like “10%,” the nostalgic “1987” and the foreboding, “New World Order.” They began work on the follow up album Annihilation Generation in 2002. However, Jerry’s waning interest in music, Bill’s commitments to other bands Deathcamp Experiment and Riot City Carnival and Brian’s involvement in Daikaju delayed the official release of Annihilation Generation until 2007. Early copies of the album were released as a split CD with the Knoxville, Tennessee based band U.S. Police State, while additional pressings did not include U.S. Police State.

With the approaching 20th anniversary of the band, Bill, Brian and Jerry began revisiting Random Conflict songs from the late 80s and early 90s like “Bloodlust,” “Alone” and “Mr. Slaughter.” In late 2008, they released the Invisible City CD on Stick Man Records, a new recording of ten early era songs and a few contemporary compositions like “Scum,” “No Communication,” “Madness” and “Insanity.”

By late 2010, Jerry left the band for good, and he was replaced on drums by Adam Jackson. Following the breakup of Adam and Bill’s other band, Blood Red Baby Blue, Adam soon lost enthusiasm for Random Conflict and by May 2012, Fist of the North Star’s former drummer Edwin Coombs joined the group.

In January 2013, the new lineup released a four-song split 7” record with Edwin’s other band, The Commonwealth of American Natives on Shit Starter Records. August 2013 marks the 25th anniversary of Random Conflict and the release of their new twelve song LP/CD, Tradition is the Enemy, on No Profit Records. 

Tradition is the Enemy is musically raw, aggressive and rebellious, yet easily accessible and masterfully produced. The songs are heavily influenced by 80s American hardcore (Black Flag and Minor Threat), early 80s U.K. punk and metal (Motörhead and Discharge) and contemporary punk (Propagandi and Leftöver Crack), but presented in a way that is fresh and uncontrived. The lyrics tear down the façade of modern culture, exposing evil and corruption, while offering hope and calling for unity. This isn’t a record you’ll hear on the radio or in a car commercial on TV. This is punk rock as it is meant to be…iconoclastic. Many critics have written punk rock’s obituary, and who can blame them? Most contemporary acts tend to be more interested in corporate sponsorships than writing and recording music that will stand the test of time. But the flame still burns in North Alabama with the punk rock stalwarts, Random Conflict!

MU330's lineup has changed frequently, but the foundations of the band remained intact — Potthast, Diebold, Bell, and Moll.

The band is self-described as ""psycho ska"" and are known for their lively performances and a general ethic of fun and optimism. At the shows spectators encouraged to do the power skank, where fans hold their arms straight out in front of them and jog in place. They have been known to break out chainsaws and other wacky devices during their shows, proclaiming themselves the ""Kings of Rock and Roll"".

Their lyrics cover many topics, from racism to love songs to testicular cancer. Their lyrics, as well as the band, has matured since their inception in 1994. In their debut album they had songs like Danska, Stuff, and Fleeba (about a smelly girlfriend, being horny, and being fat, respectively) to newer more mature themes. They also changed their sound from a farther out, more experimental ska songs to a more mainstream sound.

Singer Dan Potthast has also released solo work."

The Brooklyn Dodgers moved to L A, and Ebbets Field became The Ebbets Apartments. These were the Boys of Summer. Now, in the New Millenium we have Dem Brooklyn Bums! Formed in early 1997 by ""Broccoli"" Rob Cittadino, Dem Brooklyn Bums already boasts a solid reputation. With their second CD - ""Step up to the Plate"" - debuting on the CMJ Charts at #17; and opening for major acts all over the country such as Royal Crown Revue, Save Ferris, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and even Shaquille O'Neil; Dem Bums are poised to be bigger than U.S. Steel!

Inspired by his early experiences as a bassist in every kind of band from heavy metal to what would be the forerunner of Dem Brooklyn Bums, Captain Sticky Big Band (a spoof on old classics), ""Broccoli"" Rob discovered he had the vocal talents, music savvy, wacky humor, and boundless energy to start what would become the most original and audience-pleasing band this country's seen in ages! However, this isn't your plain old garden-variety swing. Even though the meticulous jazz chops would tell you otherwise; you don't see your average swing cats playing at 480 BPM, crowd-surfing with their upright bass, or writing tunes such as ""Switchblade Mambo"", ""Wifebeata Boogie"", ""Slap Ya' Round"" and ""Boozin' and Crozin' "". But don't call the local authorities just yet; ""Broccoli"" Rob says, ""Hey, this is just a parody. We love mom, apple pie, and the regular Joe who wants to go out with his girl, rip up the dance floor, and have the best time they've had in years!""

Joining in this mad frenzy is Rob's buddy from his teen metal days; Rich ""Dusty Chopmeat"" Zukor on drums; who's motto is ""beef before sleep"". Rich recruited Dave ""The Carnasie Kid"" Levitt from music school to cover trombone duties. From there we have, Timmy ""Pimento"" Clemente on guitar and backing vocals, Bernhard ""Gunter Ginter"" Ullrich on tenor and baritone sax, and Paulie ""Pierogies"" Brandenburg on trumpet. Not just riding the party train; Dem Bums also love to get involved in their community, and have played at several charity events. Currently, they are touring all over the US again, and will be seen at many clubs and festivals throughout the spring and summer of 2000. The main thing to remember, says Rich ""Dusty Chopmeat"": ""It doesn't matter if you can't swing dance, just grab someone and jump!""

The band started to play out in New York and immediately started to gain attention from music fans. Besides being more than capable musicians, Dem Bums are known for their high-energy show, which has affected the stingiest of audiences. These guys mix musical influences together ranging from Rock, Ska, Swing, Punk, Latin, and many others. The line-up consists of ""Broccoli Rob ""Cittadino on lead vocals and upright bass, Timmy ""Pimento"" Clemente on guitar, Rich ""Dusty Chopmeat"" Zukor on drums, Paulie ""Pierogies"" Brandenburg on trumpet, Bernhard ""Gunter Von Ginter"" Ullrich on tenor sax, and Dave ""Canarsie Kid"" Levitt on trombone. Together, these guys have been across the US numerous times and have three recordings to their credit. They played in front of 60.000 people for the millennium bash in Portland, Oregon as well as appearances at many festivals throughout the rest of the states. While enjoying these great experiences, Dem Bums often thought about recreating the same frenzy overseas in Europe in the new millenium.

The band started in 1996, as a side project of [a2681677] members in São Paulo, Brazil. The band's lyrics were focused on ""Third World struggles"" and animal liberation issues. Their sound was described as a mix of Earth Crisis metal mosh with death metal elements. The band had three singers, like their North American counterpart, Path of Resistance. Point Of No Return's first CD, ""Centelha"" (Sparks), was released by Liberation Records (BR) and Catalyst Records (US). The band toured Europe twice, in 2000 and 2002, and toured Argentina in 2001. After a seven months break and a supposed ""last show"" in Argentina, the band came back with a new album in 2002, ""Liberdade Imposta, Liberdade Conquistada"". The songs were more deep and melancholic, but also with a strong influence from bands like Cro-Mags, Judge and Napalm Death. The lyrics, this time completely in Portuguese, dealt about political and social issues. 

Point of No Return played its last show in 2006, and reunited in 2024 at ""Verdurada"" show in Brazil."

Anyways, at that time in Seattle, music was leaning toward the ""metal"" side of the equation and Chad and Eagle wanted to start a band that was reminiscent of their influences.  Bands like Hot Water Music, 88 Fingers Louie, Turning Point and Bane could be considered there ""core"" influences but they also had much broader musical tastes, from Split Lip to Bad Brains.

After working on a few songs in their cramped Capital Hill apartment they recruited Ross Swanes (Guitar) and Chris Jahn (Guitar) and rounded out the line up with Chris' younger brother Matt Jahn on bass. Taking the name Stay Gold they practiced, played some shows, had some fun, recorded a demo, and had some more fun.  Matt decided to go to Europe to play the bag pipes (not kidding), it's a bit more complex than that but he went traveling.   Stay Gold liked having two Jahns in the band so they got Cam Jahn, the middle brother of the three to play bass.

From that point Stay Gold was pretty solid:  Aram/Anchor records put Stay Gold’s s/t 7""/CDep, a few short west coast tours commenced…good times. Then Indecision signed the boys of gold to do a few records.  So out came the 7”/CDep, ""Caught up in the Moment"", and the full length CD ""Pills and Advice"" with the vinyl of that record coming out on the European label Years From Now Records.

Now the details get fuzzy…more tours, and more chaos, Chris quit and moved to New York and Paul Betinson joined Stay Gold on guitar to do a U.S. tour.  Stay Gold played what was to be their last show on August 18, 2002 at Hell’s Kitchen in Tacoma, Washington with Champion, Terror, and Allegiance.

In 1997, vocalist J.R. Hayes, guitarist Scott Hull and drummer John Evans formed the band Pig Destroyer (previously known as Cop Destroyer). As soon as the band formed, they started rehearsing. It didn't take long before the trio released a self-titled demo, and participated on a split with Orchid.

In 1998, Pig Destroyer toured the East Coast with other bands, including Drop Dead, Converge, Kid Dynamite, and Isis. Later that year they parted ways with drummer John Evans, who was then replaced by Brian Harvey. They also started to play more shows and released an album, ""Explosions in Ward 6,"" which brought them out of the underground to be known as one of the better Grindcore bands. The band continued to tour with bands like Discordance Axis, Phobia, Daybreak, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Disassociate. They also played at the 2000 March Metal Meltdown. 

In July 2000, the band signed with Relapse, and recorded a split 7"" with Isis. It sold out in a month. They later recorded and released ""38 Counts Of Battery,"" which included the remastered ""Explosions In Ward 6"" album, tracks from the Isis and Orchid splits and their demo from 1997. 

In 2001, they released ""Prowler in the yard"" which is the most extreme album they've made to date. The album got them even more fame, and the band is now of the leading Grindcore bands. 

In 2004 they released the compilation album, ""Painter of Dead Girls."""

The latest buzz band to emerge from Orlando's Jeff Hanson Management & Promotions, the company behind Creed, has just signed a deal with Epic Records. It is also building a hometown radio buzz with ""Unopened Door,"" the simmering single from its eponymously produced demo. Singer-songwriter Dave Glenn, a veteran of the Orlando scene, calls Downstem's sound ""heavy rock with soul."" It's flavored with the no-nonsense style of musicians who have made the rounds in other bands. Charlton is an alumnus of Virgos, an Orlando band that recently opened for Creed. Guitarist Mike Lynchard once played with Skrape, a local band signed to RCA.

Originally former as ""The Continentals, in 1962, soon changing their names to ""The Fabulous Continentals"".

Consisting mainly of Moses Lake High School music students, the Continentals configuration was constantly being shaped by graduation, college, the army draft and parents. When the final combination of Mike Balzotti on keyboards, Mardi Sheridan on guitar, Bob Gallaway on drums and Chuck Warren on bass arrived, a true band was born! Eight years of intense effort and creativity took the group with a new name ""The Bards"" to every **dance hall, armory, radio station and recording studio in the Northwest.

The height of their success was in 1967, following the release of ""Never Too Much Love"", with Mardi Sheridan leaving soon after, to go to San Francisco and join the ""movement"" there.
Mardi Sheridan returned to the group after ""Never Too Much Love"" had pretty much run its course. The Bards regrouped around their original English poet and minstrel theme and decided they would literally put poetry to music.
This new direction resulted in their second single, ""The Owl & The Pussy-Cat"", based on a poem by Edward Lear.

Over the course of 8 years they had recording contracts with Piccadilly, Jerden, Parrot, Mercury, Together and Capitol Records. Of a half dozen or so records, two others received significant local air play --""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"" written by Danny O'Keefe and a Jimmy Webb tune called ""Tunesmith"". 

The band disbanded in 1969, due to the strain of recording their full length debut, containing all original songs inspired from the words of other more famous ""bards"" like T.S. Elliot and others. 

In the end, after the completion of the album, their producer, Curt Boetcher offered to come back to the Northwest and sign with the group. Mardi Sheridan and Mike Balzotti were delighted with the opportunity to continue our growth with our Hollywood mentor. However, Chuck Warren and Bob Gallaway were more interested in returning to our old money making circuit and preserving our autonomy. That decision was the end of The Bards. Mike and Mardi left the group on that turn of events and ultimately moved to L.A. to pursue their writing and recording careers. Bob and Chuck regrouped and carried on with the name for a time before disbanding.

Mardi and Mike brought in Michael Langdon, a local Seattle singer song-writer extraordinaire and continued for a year or so, recording and regrouping toward a new recording / performing tour group.

Michael Balzotti and Michael Langdon got back together as a duo called ""The Michaels"", playing local Seattle clubs at night, while going to college in the daytime. Mardi Sheridan and Bob Gallaway also got respective groups together for a time, but these efforts were relatively short-lived.

Today, Mardi Sheridan is still active in many aspects of the entertainment business in Seattle; Chuck Warren is a manager at Lad Irrigation in Moses Lake; and Mike Balzotti is busy creating web sites, music and conducting business in the real estate field in Scottsdale Arizona. Bob Gallaway passed away in 1994 in Spokane.

The last time all 4 Bards were together was the occasion of Mike's 40'th birthday in 1987, with the 3 surviving members reuniting, once again, in 2002.

The Remains formed in 1964 at Boston University, where all four members were first-year students living in the same dorm in Kenmore Square. Singer-guitarist Barry Tashian and keyboardist Bill Briggs were from Westport, Connecticut, drummer Chip Damiani from Wolcott, Connecticut, and bassist Vern Miller from Livingston, New Jersey. They began playing r&b and rock'n'roll covers, as well as some Tashian originals, at The Rathskeller, a tavern across the square from their dorm. Soon, fans were lining up from Kenmore Square to Fenway Park to see them, and management had to clear out a disused basement to accommodate the crowds

The band became a popular live act throughout New England, and, after signing with Epic Records, enjoyed local hits with a catchy, swinging Tashian original, ""Why Do I Cry"", and their hard-driving version of the Bo Diddley/Willie Dixon classic ""Diddy Wah Diddy"". In 1965 the Remains relocated to New York City - where they appeared on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' - and then, after about a year, moved on to California. They recorded an album, The Remains, appeared on NBC TV's 'Hullabaloo', and released the soulful, hard-rocking single ""Don't Look Back"".[3]

In 1966 came the opportunity which might have broken the band nationally, but proved instead to be their last hurrah: they were offered a three-week stint as an opening act for the Beatles, on what would turn out to be the fab four's final tour. Immediately before the tour, drummer Chip Damiani quit the band, to be replaced by future Mountain drummer N.D. Smart. Said Tashian in a 2012 interview: ""We had always been the four of us and we’d played hundreds and hundreds of gigs as the four of us and all of a sudden this big tour comes up and boom! We have to play it with a new drummer who didn’t have the same feel that Chip had. I mean he was a fine drummer but it wasn’t the same band. I just felt like the flame was burning down without our original drummer.""[2]

The band broke up in late 1966, and Epic released their self-titled debut album to little fanfare"

Providing England with their revival of the 1960s, the trio released a number of EPs on various labels before Alopecia Records funded their 1997 debut album, The Surfisticated Sounds of the Waistcoats. Following the 10"" EP Beat Party With the Waistcoats two years later, Larsen Records released the Waistcoats' second full-length, EXPLOSION, in early 2000. They also managed to release a number of CD's, Stark Raving Mod! and All The Rage. Through the years the sound has become a bit more (not much however) polished. Their last (vinyl) album was a conceptual work called We Are The Doctors, in Jack Outhuis' words: ""It was our Village Green Preservation Society/Ogden's Nu Gone Flake album"". In 2014 the group threw a 20th anniversay party in EMG Faktors in Groningen. 
Through the years the group has been touring extensively through Europe, The U.S.A. and Great Britain. Highlights were Liverpool's Cavern, but also a gig in Austin, Texas.

Together with his brother, [a=Epic Soundtracks], [a=Nikki Sudden] formed what was to become [a=Swell Maps], releasing 4 singles and 2 albums on Rough Trade (UK) between 1977 and their break up in 1980. All these releases hit #1 in the UK Independent Charts. Swell Maps are remembered, particularly by similarly minded US based bands such as Sonic Youth, as pioneering exponents of the 'DIY Punk' school.
Sudden then began a solo career making two albums 'Waiting On Egypt' and 'The Bible Belt' before joining up with Birmingham guitarist, Dave Kusworth. The pair formed the Jacobites in 1983, going on to make two albums, 'Jacobites' and 'Robespierre’s Velvet Basement', the latter reaching No. 1 in the German Independent Charts. This tied in with their first German tour which lead to Sudden relocating there. 
When the Jacobites split in 1986, Sudden returned to his solo career with Creation Records, releasing five solo albums over the next five years: 'Texas', 'Dead Men Tell No Tales', 'Kiss You Kidnapped Charabanc' (with Rowland S. Howard), 'Groove' and a compilation, 'Back To The Coast'.
1990 found Sudden in Athens, Georgia, where sessions with [a=Peter Buck], [a=Mike Mills] and [a=Bill Berry (2)] from R.E.M. became the album 'The Jewel Thief' — later reissued as 'Liquor, Guns & Ammo'.
Kusworth and Sudden reformed The Jacobites in 1993, releasing three albums, 'Howling Good Times', 'Old Scarlett' and 'God Save Us Poor Sinners'. Their two original albums were reissued, as was a further compilation of rare tracks, 'Hawks Get Religion'. The band also released a limited edition, vinyl-only album, 'Kiss Of Life', in Germany, and a Spanish CD, 'Heart Of Hearts'.
In 1995, sessions in Chicago with members of the Chamber Strings and The Rosehips led to his seventh solo release 'Seven Lives Later'. This album featured musicians from The Jet Boys, The True Spirit, The Fatal Shore, Band Of Outsiders, Once Upon A Time, Vermooste Vløten, The Flaming Stars, Sonic Youth, Voodoo Witch, and The Jacobites.
Into the 2000's Sudden continued to tour extensively, playing around 100 shows per year, half with his backing band 'The Last Bandits' and half solo.
Nikki, with the Last Bandits, recorded his ninth solo release, 'Treasure Island', in England during summer 2002. Special guests include Ian McLagan (Small Faces, Faces), Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Anthony Thistlethwaite (Waterboys), Dave Kusworth (Jacobites) and Darrell Bath (Dogs D’Amour / Crybabys). The 'Treasure Island' release date was in 2004.
A retrospective, 'The Last Bandit (The Best Of Nikki Sudden)' was released by Glitterhouse Records in Europe, Wagging Dog Records in England, and Bomp Records in America, and features remastered and edited versions of  Sudden's most popular solo work.
Sudden's death in New York followed a number of solo performances in the USA after which a short European tour by The Jacobites had been scheduled. The first of these dates, on 29th March 2006 at London's '12 Bar Club', took place but was transformed into a tribute to Nikki Sudden's memory and featured a number of musicians with whom he had played.

Eventually, Brown returned to Michigan and in 1998, he met up with guitarist and singer Jud Branam; together, they formed Corndaddy with drummer Will Stewart and bassist Jerry Hancock. The group released a self-titled debut album in 2000, with a follow-up, Better Days, hitting the racks in 2002.

Richard Youngs is a British musician with a prolific and diverse output, including many collaborations. Based in Glasgow since the early 1990s, his extensive back catalogue of solo and collaborative work formally begins with Advent, first issued in 1990. He plays many instruments, most commonly choosing the guitar, but he has been known to use a wide variety of other instruments including the shakuhachi, accordion, theremin, dulcimer, a home-made synthesizer (common on early recordings) and even a motorway bridge. He also released an album which was entirely a cappella.

For many years, live performances were very occasional and almost always in Glasgow; he has stated publicly that he finds live performance ""incredibly nerve-racking: stomach cramps, tension headaches..."". However, in recent years, he has performed more regularly (including a tour of New Zealand in 2010 and a UK tour in support of Damon and Naomi in 2011) and many of his recent shows have been predominantly vocal - he told The Wire (issue 284) ""I went to a laptop concert and decided I was going to sing""."

Born on September 19, 1936 in New York City, New York.
Died on October 7, 2011 in Tiburon, California.

David Hess began his career when he recorded the original version of the Otis Blackwell composition ""All Shook Up"" under the stage name David Hill in 1956. The song became a Number 1 hit for Elvis Presley a year later and Hess became a songwriter at Shalimar Music. 

David went on to compose ""Start Movin'"" for Sal Mineo and ""Rockin' Shoes"" for the Ames Brothers. He continued to write songs for Elvis throughout the '50s and '60s, (including the Presley hit ""I Got Stung"" that was later covered by The Beatles). Other Hess tunes performed by The King include ""Come Along,"" and ""Make Me Know You're Mine"" (first performed by Conway Twitty). ""Your Hand, Your Heart, Your Love"" became a 60s hit when it was performed by Andy Williams. 

In 1963 David wrote and recorded ""Speedy Gonzalez,"" which became a number one single for Pat Boone, selling more than eight million copies worldwide. David then recorded two solo albums for Kapp Records, again topping the charts, this time with a Top Ten folk hit called ""Two Brothers."" 

After a career as a record company executive, including becoming head of A&R at Mercury Records (where he co-wrote the Grammy award winning 1970 rock opera ‘The Naked Carmen’) in New York and working with PolyGram Records’ German affiliate in the 1970s, Hess took on the role of actor, writer, director and producer in the movie industry. 

Writing the English language shooting scripts for such German directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Reinhard Hauff, Peter Schamoni,… and directing the 1980 slasher “To All A Good Night” were only a few of his many accomplishments. 

Most will remember him as Krug Stillo, an unrepentant serial killer and leader of a gang in Wes Craven's classic 1972 cult shocker “The Last House On The Left” (inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s ‘The Virgin Spring’), as well as portraying the villains in Ruggero Deodato’s “House on the Edge of the Park” (1980) and Wes Craven’s “Swamp Thing” (1982). Other movie roles include ’21 Hours At Munich’, ‘Hitch-Hike’, ‘White Star’, ‘Body Count’ and ‘Zodiac Killer’. David Hess also appeared regularly on the TV screen with appearances in shows such as ‘Knight Rider’, ‘The A-Team’, ‘The Fall Guy’ & ‘Royal Pains’. 

Throughout his film career Hess' love for music never waned. He continued to produce music, including several albums (""Caught Up In The Moment"" and ""Live & Unplugged in Hollywood, 2002.""). Some of his music can also be heard on more recent soundtracks, such as ‘Cabin Fever’ (2002) and ‘Manhunt’ (2008). Hess also composed the soundtrack for Wes Craven's classic 1972 cult shocker “The Last House On The Left” in collaboration with Steve Chapin (Let Time Go Lightly).

He passed away at the age of 75, just two years after his role in the 2009 horror epic “Smash Cut” starring Sasha Grey."

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

For many years down in his cellar, Jeff played that boogie-woogie fast and slow, and performed long Gene Krupa / Cozy Cole style solos on his drums. During 1956 and 1957 he bought every single rock & roll, rockabilly and rhythm & blues record he could afford.

Based in Northampton, Massachusetts, Jeff played in various recording bands for 12 years (including Al Anderson's Wildweeds) before writing, singing and performing his own songs, mostly in the 50's rock & roll style. He fronted two bands, The Contenders, then later Jeff Potter & The Rhythm Agents. He also plays the piano with New York rockabillys The Lustre Kings.

From 1998 to 2002 Jeff and Betsy-Dawn Williams played in a band called American Roadhouse together featuring a mix of rock & roll, R&B and rockabilly. In 2003 he played at the Rockin' Fifties Fest in Green Bay, Wisconsin, with The Lustre Kings. His recordings have been released by Nervous, Fury, Dynamite and Raucous Records. Jeff still plays his drums in the cellar.

The album ""Rhythm Riot"" is really incredible, it has the ingredients of many styles of American roots music, ranging from boogie woogie to rock 'n' roll to rockabilly to rhythm & blues. A magician on the piano, a wizzard on the drums and a good songwriter as well, all songs are self-penned originals. The album hits off with a steady boogie woogie rhythm on a song titled ""Don't Stop Now"", switching to rockabilly on ""The Party"" with great piano and guitar breaks (think Freddy 'Fingers' Lee).

The best is yet to come, the title song ""Rhythm Riot"" is something else. Pounding drums (Sandy Nelson style), complete with solo, and a twangy guitar (Duane Eddy style), this is a Jeff Potter original that will raise the hairs in your neck. As easy as pie, Jeff switches over to the blues on the touchy ""How Come"", and back to rock 'n' roll on ""I Don't Wanna Go"". The album is packed with American roots music with a lot of variety, energy and skill. You just gotta love it. At the end of the CD there's also a hidden bluesy track which sounds a bit like a John Lee Hooker jam session."

Raised by his grandparents in Reading, MA, Simon Stokes was seen by his peers as a loner or solitary child. By the age of ten he had become a sleepwalker. His grandfather would often take Stokes to see the Harry D. Stokes Orchestra, which was his introduction to music. In his teenage years, Stokes became influenced by the blues, often listening to a local DJ named Sid Symphony and attending all-night concerts. Stokes saw Big Mama Thornton and Hank Ballard among countless others, each having an impact on him. After entering a local songwriting contest and winning the top prize, Stokes ventured to Los Angeles in his early 20s. Beginning in 1965, Stokes recorded a number of 45s under names such as the Flower Children and Heathen Angels. At the same time, Stokes became a staff writer at Elektra Records. Forming a band called the Nighthawks, Stokes and MC5 signed to Elektra on the same day.

In 1973, Stokes released his debut album, Incredible Simon Stokes & the Black Whip Thrill Band on Spindizzy Records, described by some as a psychedelic blues record in the vein of Captain Beefhart. The album's cover was reportedly the first banned album cover in the United States. Featuring S&M scenes as well as females being whipped, the controversy created a cult following for the musician, especially among biker groups. In 1977, Buzzard of Love was released. After this album, Stokes basically went underground, releasing no material for nearly two decades. In 1996, he returned to music circles by releasing Right to Fly which he did with '60s counter-culture icon Timothy Leary. In 2002, Stokes released a country-rock album titled Honky. Featuring members of the Bellrays and Wayne Kramer, the album's sound was compared to outlaw singers such as Waylon Jennings and David Allan Coe."

Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends [a=Gram Parsons] and [a=Chris Hillman] (both former members of [a=The Byrds]), the group underwent many personnel changes. 

The original group featured Parsons and Hillman as primary vocalists, guitarists and composers with [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow] (pedal steel guitar), [a=Chris Ethridge] (bass) and a rotating series of drummers. [a=Michael Clarke] (also a former member of The Byrds) was eventually added as permanent drummer, while Ethridge was replaced by guitarist [a=Bernie Leadon] after Hillman switched to bass following the first album.

Following the second album Burrito Deluxe, Gram Parsons was succeeded as frontman by [a=Rick Roberts] for one studio album and a live album. The group then splintered; Chris Hillman and [a=Al Perkins] (Kleinow's replacement) joined [a=Manassas], Bernie Leadon founded [a=Eagles], and later additions [a=Byron Berline], [a=Roger Bush] and [a=Kenny Wertz] formed [a=Country Gazette]. Following a 1973 European tour with new members, Rick Roberts dissolved the band and began a solo career, before forming [a=Firefall] with Michael Clarke. 

After original members Kleinow and Ethridge reformed the band in the mid-1970s with new players (including more former members of The Byrds, [a=Gene Parsons] and [a=Skip Battin]), a more Nashville-centered incarnation of the band led by [a=Gib Guilbeau] and [a=John Beland] eventually emerged, recording & touring through the 1980s as [a=Burrito Brothers].

Pete Kleinow began using the Flying Burritos Bros name again in the mid 1980s, eventually being joined by Gib and John.  Through numerous incarnations (nearly all with Beland at the helm), the band released albums and toured throughout the 1980s and '90s. The latter day Flying Burrito Brothers CDs, produced by Beland, did feature an impressive line-up of guests, including [a=Merle Haggard], [a=Buck Owens], [a=Waylon Jennings], [a=Alison Krauss], [a=Ricky Skaggs], [a=Charles Louvin], and others. The band's final two CDs, [m=1168733] and [r=5398239] received solid critical reviews, but Beland called it quits for the band in 2000, finally ending the band. He embarked upon a successful career as a record producer, The trademark for Flying Burrito Brothers' name was acquired by Chris Hillman in the 2010s.

Kleinow's 2000s spin-off band [a=Burrito Deluxe] featured [a=Carlton Moody (2)] on lead vocals and [a=Garth Hudson] from [a=The Band] on keyboards. The band scored no chart success, relying solely on live appearances in Europe. Kleinow left the band due to illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to any of the actual Flying Burrito Brothers members, past or present, although the band carried on until 2010 when it became [a=The Burritos], and then in 2014 [a=The Burrito Brothers]. A band calling itself The Burrito Brothers continues to tour and release music. 

Key band members included: [a=Gram Parsons], [a=Chris Hillman], [a=Sneaky Pete Kleinow], [a=Chris Ethridge], [a=Michael Clarke], [a=Rick Roberts], and [a=Bernie Leadon]."

Stuart was personally given permission to use the band's name by Johnny Cash himself.

He was also honored by the Man in Black with an invitation to record songs at Cash's own home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Two other iconic music legends, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, were also early believers who were instrumental in helping Stuart get his start.

With the release of their critically acclaimed debut CD""Walk Alone"" in 1999, the Bastard Sons quickly proved they were no novelty act. With strong songwriting and great musicianship, the Sons' quickly jumped to the forefront of the growing Alternative Country Scene. No stranger to the road, their constant touring and hard work have built the band a loyal grass roots following both in the States and abroad.

Whether performing in front of thousands at a Festival in the US or Europe, or playing all night in a Texas dance hall, for Stuart it’s all about respect. ""The Bastard Sons never were, and never will be, a Johnny Cash tribute band.""  It's always been about honoring the musical ideals of our heroes, and paying respect to the originality, integrity, and independence that made those artists who they are. Our goal was always to find our own road, and to continue to keep the sounds and traditions of American Roots Music alive.

Stuart and the Bastard Sons have released 5 outstanding CD’s: Walk Alone, Distance Between, Mile Markers, Bend in the Road, and their latest New Old Story. Their music has been featured in Film, Television, and compilation CD's around the world."

Fans will cheer the band’s return the way families celebrate a long-awaited reunion. The Midwestern guitar rock unit is back with “Black Dirt Blue Sky,” their first collection of new recordings in 10 years.
The music radiates a spirit of renewal, like a John Deere tractor turning over a patch of rich soil. And the musicians pack more passion into the material than a team of horses in their prime, eager to work. The recordings show how much bandmates Edward David Anderson, Matt Anderson, Scott Tipping and John Ganser are happy to play new songs together after a decade-long hiatus.
“These tunes and this lineup are by far the best this band has ever sounded,” lead vocalist and songwriter Edward David Anderson said.
“Black Dirt Blue Sky” is loaded with moments that coax smiles and recall good memories. “Carefree Kids” inspires nostalgia, while “Alejandro Escovedo” is both a wry ode to the mystery of dreams and a nod to the iconic rocker. The band’s experience touring the USA and recording a series of timeless alt-country records in the early aughts informs the present-day energy of tunes like “Little Wren” and the music shines with beauty and joy, like light at the end of a long tunnel.
“It's a story of redemption and perseverance, of second chances,” Anderson said. “The pandemic even tried to foil it, but we wouldn't have it. We hunkered down and put this beautiful recording together in home studios throughout Illinois and beyond.”
BTF were darlings of radio stations like Chicago’s WXRT-FM in the early 2000s. Grammy Award-winning producer Steve Berlin of Los Lobos produced their 2010 album, “Good To Be.” Johnny Hickman of Cracker compared them to Wilco. The music rings with crisp guitar tones, tight harmonies and pointed lyrics. Anderson and Tipping (The Mighty Blue Kings) create the core vibe with skillful guitar work. Anderson’s brother, Matt, plays bass with new guy Ganser (The Something Brothers) on drums. From the hard driving “House of Cards” to the country ballad “Truck Stop Shower,” the songs on “Black Dirt Blue Sky” make the new sound familiar and the familiar sound new.
Anderson has released four acclaimed solo albums in recent years and performed extensively throughout the country. Since the band stopped recording and touring together in 2011, bandmates have overcome great losses to make joyous music together again.
“Hearing some of those older tunes I had written and cared so deeply about made me want to play them again, but it was the new material that really excited me.” Anderson said. I had a strong urge to make music with my brother again. So we called our old pal and touring guitar player, brought in the drummer that I had been playing with the previous five years, and Backyard Tire Fire was reborn.” 
“Black Dirt Blue Sky” is produced by EDA and was independently released Sept 10, 2021 by Anderson’s Black Dirt Records in conjunction with the Royal Potato Family label. Backyard Tire Fire performed at Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, IL, Alternating Currents in Davenport, IA and Black Dirt Music Festival in Bloomington, IL in 2021 and plans to play select dates and festival plays in 2022 and beyond.

269915,0,859824,US,The Charlie Daniels Band,Redneck Fiddlin' Man,2002,48.1,12,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Country Rock', 'Southern Rock']","The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with [a=Charlie Daniels] joined by [a=Barry Barnes] (guitar), [a=Mark Fitzgerald] (bass), [a=Fred Edwards] and [a=Gary Allen] (drums), and [a=Taz DiGregorio] (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."
