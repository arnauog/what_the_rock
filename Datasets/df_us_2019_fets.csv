But such a characterization would miss the mark. Neal is more curious than distracted, more inquisitive than restless. In his mastery of rock, funk, folk, blues, jazz, and even musical theatre, he embodies the modern pop artist: an intrepid tourist of styles.

After releasing four albums independently, Neal created his 2016 Wampus debut, The Mayor of Estes Park, by raising every bar, from songwriting to performance to arrangements. From existential funk to plaintive wit to loopy joy, he grabbed with hooks and grooves, pranks and koans. Swinging from the mainstream to the fringe, he was earnestly sincere one minute and brutally sardonic the next.

Then, in an epoch of budding cultural collapse, he issued the bittersweet and unsparing follow-up, Mistakes of Memory. Relying on his mastery of musical theatre and zeal for classic prog, Neal crafted a narrative of longing and disconnection, a timeless pop curio that recalled nothing so much as the adventurousness of ‘70s rock. Yet the funky and mordant “Claudius,” a parable of American leadership circa 2020, placed Mistakes firmly in the glare of its moment and positioned Neal as an artist to watch amid chaos and change.

Now, in the wake of a pandemic that waxes and wanes but never quite vacates, Neal delivers the provocative and bitingly personal I’ll See You When I See You,  an obliquely passionate salvo that feels alien yet warmly familiar. On one level, it maps the dissolution of a (virtual? long-distance?) romantic entanglement. On another, it explores the mystery and dread framing the global perception of Russian culture.

As always, Neal refracts the depth and diversity of his influences: Leonard Cohen, Pink Floyd, ELO, Stevie Wonder, Steely Dan, and Stephen Sondheim.

“All my albums touch on religion, sex, age, and hope,” he says. “I treat them all like musicals.”

I’ll See You When I See You comes out May 20, 2022.

Ofege was largely influenced by the guitar solos of Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Francis Rossi, and the criss-cross rhythms of Osibisa. At home, they were influenced by the music of ‘BLO’ (Berkley Jones, Laolu Akins and Mike Odumosu), ‘Monomono’ (led by Joni Haastrup), The Funkees, and Ofo The Black Company. Comband Razor said ""It's clear that for Ofege, songs were largely incidental, little more than excuses to launch into insane, distorted guitar solos. It's also very clear that they smoked a lot of weed."" Their first album was recorded while the band members were still in high school (average age of 16), Ofege’s debut album ""Try And Love"" was originally recorded and released in 1973 and overdubbed by Berkley Jones' guitar. Due to their vibrant combo of sweet harmonies, hooks & fuzz, they would become one of the most legendary Nigerian groups of all time, with impressive sales and national stardom.
However, with only four albums released until 1978 and no recognition outside Nigeria, Ofege’s short career would only be rediscovered with the turn of the century.

""The Last Of The Origins"" is a great funk-rock record with a rather psychedelic approach. The rhythm section is attractive and complex and has African inspirations. The lyrics aren’t particlulary inspired, but the drive is incredible, and they draw attention to instrumental parts wherever they can. The psychedelic organ takes care of the mind-losing groove, while fuzz guitars soar and improvise. The 60s influenced vocals can be reminiscent of the Stones, or just leave themselves flooding with the psychedelic drive. 

It took some years before other albums appeared since some band members still had to finish university.

The Brooklyn-born Sands' husky, soulful voice first attracted the attention of Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller's Blue Cat label in 1965, and upon signing with the company she entered the studio with the songwriting/production team of Chip Taylor and Al Gorgoni to record her debut single, ""Take Me for a Little While."" Prior to the record's release, a test pressing was smuggled to executives at Chess Records, where Chicago soul singer Jackie Ross immediately cut her own version of the song; just as Sands' rendition of ""Take Me for a Little While"" cracked the R&B charts, Chess' marketing muscle assured that Ross' cover began receiving the lion's share of radio airplay, leaving the original in the dust. (Ross, it should be noted, was initially unaware that the test pressing had been stolen and left Chess soon after.) The ensuing litigation severely hobbled Sands' fledgling career, and her follow-up, 1966's superb ""I Can't Let Go,"" was lost in the mire; a year later, the song became a major international hit for the Hollies. Moving to the Cameo label, in 1967 Sands resurfaced with the Taylor-penned ""Angel of the Morning""; despite heavy early airplay, within weeks of the single's release Cameo went bankrupt, allowing Merilee Rush's recording of the song to top the pop charts a few months later. In 1969 Sands finally notched a hit of her own with ""Any Way That You Want Me,"" also issuing an LP of the same name. She spent the majority of the following decade focusing primarily on songwriting, however, and after completing the 1979 RCA album Suspended Animation retired from performing altogether. In 1996, Sands joined Taylor onstage during a gig in Los Angeles, the impromptu reunion proving so successful that they agreed to re-ignite their collaboration; the album Women in Prison, distinguished by a far more rootsy feel than her blue-eyed soul near-hits of the 1960s, followed in 1999.

Despite this, the band still performed at the exclusively Christian music festivals Greenbelt and Cornerstone, and had their music (albeit against their wishes) distributed through Christian bookstores. The group formed in 1989 and broke up in early 1993.

Chagall Guevara reunited twice. In 1994, a track titled ""Treasure of the Broken Land"" appeared on the Mark Heard tribute album ""Strong Hand of Love and the Orphans of God"" double-CD, which were sold mainly through Christian bookstores and similar outlets. The band reunited again in Nashville at a private industry party in October, 2005.

In 2020, Chagall Guevara successfully funded a [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thelastamen/chagall-guevara-the-last-amen]Kickstarter campaign[/url].

They changed their name to The Matches in 2002 and released 3 studio albums before going on hiatus in 2009. They have reunited every few years since, celebrating the 10-year anniversaries of each of their albums with performances and deluxe vinyl reissues.

The Locals were formed by high school students [a=Matt Esposito] (lead guitar, backing vocals), Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals), Matt Whalen (drums, percussion), and Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar). [a=Miles Hurwitz] became their manager in 2000 and played a major role in guiding their career, including acting as co-writer and producer. Esposito left after graduating and was replaced by Jon Devoto. As The Locals, the band released a 6-song demo and 3-song EP, and built up a following in the East Bay. In 2002, threatened with a copyright infringement lawsuit by [a=Yvonne Doll And The Locals], they changed their name to The Matches.

The Matches recorded and self-released their first album, [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] (2003). They signed to Epitaph Records, who re-mixed and re-released it the following year. Their second album, [i]Decomposer[/i] (2006) took their music in a more idiosyncratic direction with contributions from nine different record producers. It reached no. 18 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. Extensive worldwide touring followed over the next two years. Their third album, [i]A Band In Hope[/i], was released in March 2008 and found them shifting further away from pop-punk. It reached no. 179 on the [i]Billboard[/i] 200. San Souci left the band that July and was replaced by Dylan Rowe.

The Matches announced a hiatus in July 2009. Shortly thereafter, they self-released the digital album [i]The Matches Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title? Or Not Needed?[/i], a collection of demos and unreleased tracks. Devoto started [a=Bird By Bird], while Harris started [a=Maniac (19)], then [a=Fortress Social Club].

In 2014 the lineup of Harris, San Souci, Whalen, and Devoto reconvened to re-release [i]E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals[/i] as a deluxe 2-LP set. A string of reunion shows resulted in the digital live album [i]10YearsEVDKTL[/i]. A new single, ""Life Of A Match / Crucial Comeback"", followed in 2015. The following year they re-released [i]Decomposer[/i], also as a deluxe 2-LP set, and again played a series of shows resulting in a digital live album, [i]Recomposer[/i]. They repeated this pattern again in 2018, reissuing [i]A Band In Hope[/i] as a deluxe 2-LP set followed by a series of shows and the digital live album [i]Aband1nh0pe[/i]."

In 2010, after returning from a European tour with [a1581575], Peter Dreimanis  approached Leah Fay after hearing her sing with art/folk group Mothers of Brides at a bar in Toronto. Dreimanis and Fay began to record demos together, and soon formed July Talk with Josh Warburton, Danny Miles, and Eamon McGrath. Eight months later, McGrath left the band to focus on his own material and was replaced by Ian Docherty. 

In 2014 July Talk was nominated for Breakthrough Group of the Year at the 2014 Juno Awards in Canada.  In 2015, they won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year for their self-titled debut album [m631209], beginning a series of wins in this category that continued with their sophomore release [m1055646] in 2017 and their third album [m1770176] in 2021. [m1055646] also garnered Recording Engineer of the Year honours from the 2017 Junos.

While their debut release features a heavy blues rock sound, July Talk's sound has expanded to incorporate elements of synth rock, disco, and 80s post-punk and experimental influences.  

In 2020, July Talk parted ways with their original management team, moving to  [l124211] under a management-only deal and remaining under distribution with  [l627593] (now Majestic Silk) for their third release [m1770176].  

In 2021, Dreimanis and Goldstein announced the launch of Danuta, a production company for creating music videos and other art projects.  To date, the company has produced videos for the likes of Jasmyn Burke, Lou Canon and ""After This"", the lead single for July Talk's fourth album.

2021 also marked the debut of percussionist Dani Nash joining the live lineup of the band.  In 2022, the band promotional images and bio were updated to reflect Nash as an official sixth member of the group, with songwriting credits attributed to her for the fourth album.  2022 also marked a full transition by the band to  [l124211] for management and distribution, marking the end of their relationship with  [l627593]Majestic Silk."

The group formed in 1976 in Queens, New York with vocalist/keyboardist Peter Zaremba, guitarist Keith Streng, bassist Jan Marek Pakulski, and drummer Bill Milhizer and aimed to return rock & roll to the simplicity and unself-consciousness of the '50s and early '60s. (The group was often joined on-stage and in the studio by sax player [a=Gordon Spaeth], who passed on in 2005.) The group fit nicely into New York's punk and new wave scene, and an early single, ""American Beat,"" attracted the attention of independent label Red Star and, in time, I.R.S. The group's debut EP, Up-Front, was released in 1980 and was followed by their first full-length album, Roman Gods, and Blast Off!, an unreleased studio album recorded for Red Star in 1978. 1983 produced Hexbreaker, widely regarded as the Fleshtones' finest album. The band continued to record through the '80s and released Powerstance in 1992 and Beautiful Light in 1994. (Powerstance also marked the debut of new Fleshtones bassist Ken Fox, who replaced Pakulski in the lineup and has been with the group ever since.) While the group's popularity dipped under the radar in the last half of the '90s, in 2003 the group bounded back when they were signed to the potent indie label Yep Roc Records and released one of their best albums, Do You Swing? An equally solid follow-up, Beachhead, was issued in 2005 and was produced in part by Detroit garage rock kingpin [a=Jim Diamond (2)]. Fleshtones side projects include Keith Streng's band [a=Full Time Men], which featured R.E.M. guitarist [a=Peter Buck], and [a=Peter Zaremba's Love Delegation]. In 2008, more than 30 years after the group formed, they released Take a Good Look, proving their ability to be just as raucous as they were in the good ol' days."

He became further discouraged from the industry after being kicked out his first band because of his lack of vocal ability. As a college student, he began to struggle with manic depression, anxiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. After spending days in bed at a time and flunking out of school, he found himself too afraid to ask for help for fear of the judgement of others. In November of 2015, he attempted suicide. Segura penned the lyrics to Let It Burn on a napkin from his hospital bed, a song that would be released on the band’s debut E.P. Caroline. That experience gave him the drive to finally take his pursuit of music seriously with a strong desire to write music that would help combat mental illness stigma and help others struggling to know they are not alone. After many attempts at getting a band together the final lineup was completed with Jake Segura on vocals, Matt Duffney and Kooper Hanosky on guitar, Wonitta on Bass, and Tyler Nichols on drums. The band name Citizen Soldier is the band’s attempt to personify the battles waged inside and the band’s goal to shine a light on the everyday struggles of those who feel overlooked and unappreciated. New to the Salt Lake City scene in early 2017, Citizen Soldier is in its infancy but working relentlessly to make a name for themselves.
Since Citizen Soldier’s debut in 2017, the Salt Lake City-based music group has been all about honoring those who fight battles every day that others dismiss or judge them for. Those battling mental illness, abuse, stigmatization, and being ostracised have embraced their music as a representation of their own stories and struggles. As the community has grown and word has spread, many have found a refuge of survivors to share in their pain."

Helvetia's first record, ""The Clever North Wind"" (2006), was released on The Static Cult Label and distributed by Up Records. Their first national exposure was achieved by touring with Built To Spill. Helvetia is produced/performed by Jason Albertini and sustained by a rotating live line-up, which has included C. Dove Amber, Jim Roth and Scott Plouf. Their third release, ""Headless Machine of the Heart"" (2008) was recorded entirely on a 4-track tape machine. Helvetia continues to release music through The Static Cult Label (which is helmed by Duster-mate Clay Parton). The name Helvetia is the female personification of Switzerland, the childhood home of Jason Albertini.

From another info page:

Helvetia (pronounced “hel-vee-shuh"") is the project of Jason Albertini, a previous member of UP Records band Duster and current bassist of Built To Spill. The band consists of former Duster bandmate Dove Amber, along with Zeke Howard, formerly of Love As Laughter (Glacial Pace, Sub Pop, UP Records), Samantha Stidham, and Jim Roth, also of Built To Spill. Having grown up in Basel, Switzerland, Albertini chose the name ‘Helvetia’ — the female personification of Switzerland — because of its lyrical and poetic sound. Between 2006 and 2011, Helvetia put out seven releases on The Static Cult Label, run by Duster’s Clay Parton, and toured with bands like Built To Spill and Meat Puppets. After running monitors and performing other roadie duties for Built To Spill for years, Albertini officially joined the band in 2012.

Known for recording most of Helvetia’s albums himself on a 4-track (except for 2008’s The Acrobats, recorded at the Seattle-based studio of Built To Spill’s Jim Roth), Albertini’s songs are raw, experimental, and psych-tinged. 2012’s Nothing In Rambling, the band’s first release for Joyful Noise Recordings, featured some of their most focused and inspired tracks to date. Shortly after its release, Albertini started recording new material that was deemed lost after a computer meltdown, but was eventually recovered and released as A Dot Running For the Dust - The Lost Sessions in early 2015. It will be followed by Helvetia’s new album, Dromomania, due out October 2nd on Joyful Noise.

“Dromomania” evokes the simplicity of ‘70s Kinks, combined with a good dose of Captain Beefheart and the randomness of The Residents. Third-wave hardcore influences meld with elements of Neu-like trance rock; Meat Puppets and Elevator to Hell come together on tracks like “Bermuda” and “Radio Shower.” Dromomania is a condition of wandering with no notice of intent nor memory of getting to where you’re going — just when you think you can get comfortable, you’re transported to a different place with a different set of ideals. Dromomania is a vague sense of feeling and dreams a-plenty."

After cutting his teeth with solo project genCAB, and long-running industrial Aesthetic Perfection, Pity sparked to life when David Dutton (guitar, vocals, synthesizers) and sister-in-law Natalie Rakes (bass, vocals) started jamming Dutton’s yet-unnamed new material and loud sonic flow ensued. Rakes, having plied the depths of Los Angeles with The Midnight Shakes and her solo work as Natalie Nylon, including being featured on American Horror Story, now anchors a guitar maelstrom with haunting echos and saturated low-end bass to get lost in.

With the final addition of the veteran production ear of Jeff Zeigler (Nothing, War On Drugs, Kurt Vile), their new EP, Everlasting Sunday, will leave you feeling nostalgic for the romantic post-apocalyptic future you’ve never had. It’s out for preorder September 29th 2017, and releases on Halloween 2017."

Carrie Carter, Mitchella Phipps, and Paulina Vazquez  met in Whitesburg, KY, and started playing music in early 2018, around the time they were converging to create East Kentucky’s first Girls Rock Camp, Girls Rock Whitesburg—a part of the Girls Rock Camp Alliance, an international membership network of youth-centered arts and social justice organizations. Bringing together their respective musical backgrounds in classical, punk, Appalachian old-time, folk, and Mexican Folklorico dance, when they started playing together they found they had a naturally matched energy and were continually excited with what they created. Through their powerful, playful and brash co-written songs, the trio take the listener through twisting punk, classic rock, and surf-rock inspired riffs and beats, self-described as ""contraceptive rock,"" With the release of their eponymous debut, they will tour Cincinnati, Lexington, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, ending with a hometown show at the Whitesburg venue Summit City. https://slutpill.bandcamp.com/ 

Individual Bios

Mitchella Phipps
Mitchella Phipps (she/they) was born and dazed in Letcher County, Kentucky. She got her first guitar at age 6, but had been dragging her father’s instruments through the house long before then. Other than the basics (taught by her father), she is a self-taught guitarist and multi-instrumentalist. Some of her earliest musical memories include her parent’s stereo system and  lots of rock ‘n’ roll on vinyl. Mitchella studied Sociology and Gender Studies at Morehead State University but longed to be home. Upon returning, with a plan to create change in her community, she began the dearest of her work with co-creating and coordinating Girls Rock Whitesburg. Other than her organizing work, she has also been a musical instructor for several after-school and summer youth programs including Junior Appalachian Musicians (JAMS), Passing the Pick & Bow (WMMT), and the world-renowned Cowan Creek Mountain Music School. Her art has been recognized and supported by the Kentucky Foundation for Women. While off-stage, she spends her time nestled in a holler past county maintenance with partner Tanya B. Turner and boxer Louie Armstrong. Mitchella is into movie quotes, puns, and intersectional feminism, which often fuels the songwriting and sound that is Slut Pill.

Paulina Vazquez
Paulina is originally from Omaha, Nebraska—a city known for its vibrant music scene. She’s lived in various cities, always immersing herself in the music scenes and bashfully playing at open mics. She landed in Whitesburg, KY in 2015. She’s classically trained in piano, voice, and dance, and picked up her first guitar at age 12, falling in love with playing music in her childhood bedroom and recording covers and originals on Pro-Tools. She’s grown up around the importance of community involvement, while weaving together art and social justice. She grew up dancing traditional Mexican folk dance at her aunt’s Latin-American Museum. She is a member of Cornbread & Tortillas, a collective of Latin-American and Appalachian artists who build community through art, culture, dance, and community outreach. 



Carrie Wells Carter
Carrie was born and raised in Red Bush, Kentucky, to a musical and artistic family. She grew up learning and playing traditional old-time fiddle and continues to play and teach fiddle lessons in Whitesburg. She lives with her partner Matthew, their toddler, Ophelia, and part-time with Matthew’s daughter, Teagun. The pair are continuing musical and artistic traditions with their children and are constantly balancing all their band practices in their home. Aside from music, Carrie also spends time painting, quilting, and mothering in the mountains of east Kentucky.

And well…that’s not inaccurate (this is the genre that gave us nearly half-hour opuses about giant, weaponized cyborg Armadillos and the struggle between reason and sentiment as personified by Greek gods). But Great Wide Nothing turns many of these tropes on their head, infusing prog with emotional immediacy and the vital energy of the rock underground. This gritty, decidedly more down-to-earth approach yields something more akin to a kind of retrofuturist punk than the fantastical escapism & esoteric musings of the genre’s 70’s forebears.

A staple of the Atlanta music scene, Great Wide Nothing - comprising bassist/frontman and primary songwriter Daniel Graham, keyboardist Dylan Porper and drummer Jeff Matthews - has spent nearly a decade in the trenches, gradually amassing a cult following with their expansive, wide-screen arrangements and pop-friendly hooks, counterbalanced by bombastic, balls-out musicianship and earnest, often existential and socio-politically minded lyrics.

In 2000, Lisa Mathews had a baby and decided to put Love Riot on the shelf, wanting to create music for the little one taking all her attention Mikel Gehl and his wife had a son a year after, and the two founded Milkshake, a rock band for kids. Millkshake went on to release 5 award-winning albums for kids. 2010's Great Day received a Gramy nomination for ""Best Musical Recording For Children"".

Jonathan Russell is most known for his amazing talents as the vocalist in his own band, Stands With Fists. Stands With Fists has had a lot of independent success as well doing several huge events such as Knot Fest & KFMA’s Fall Ball just to name a few. Jacob reached out to Jonathan back in July, with an idea and concept never before seen or done in Tucson. A fusion of hardcore passionate hip hop lyrics, blended with high energy, aggressive metal tones and rhythms. The one thing missing was a band to make it all come together. Using his deep connections in the Tucson metal scene, Jonathan reached out to a young talented group of musicians to finalize this new super group. Guitarists Lawrence McIntyre & Jesse Espich team up with drummer James Ringstrom, and bassist Alex Parra to provide a unique, yet marketable sound to accompany Jonathan’s wide vocal range and dynamic melodies, as well as Jacob’s gritty yet clever rhymes and distinct voice. Their debut single “Strength Through Struggle” has done amazing numbers, and is available on all major digital music outlets. The band released their follow up single and very first music video “Voices” on their YouTube channel Friday January 15, 2016. The band then followed up with their first studio recorded EP “Sex Is Power”, which made an immediate impact charting as high as #8 on Itunes for new releases for the Rock Genre, and stayed at #1 on Amazon for new alternative metal release for the first 2 weeks. Be on the lookout for their debut album “Sex Money Power” under the home umbrella RuffLife Recordz coming out this Summer 2016."

At age 20 Bobby studied studio engineering at Dick Grove School of Music in Los Angeles but never finished the course. As he recalls, “It was 1985 and there were new advances in music happening at the time. It was the time for synths and drum machines and midi and I was learning how to mic clarinets for crying out loud!” Anxious to get his music career started he jumped at the chance when he got offered to help form a band with his high school buddy Paul ‘Pablo’ Thomas. “Paul encouraged me to become a lyricist because he knew I loved literature and that I wrote. Later when the band was forming he pushed me to become the front man when other singers auditioning all flaked out.“ The project evolved into the Post-Punk Goth band Life After Death, who recorded a 4-song EP and made a video for one of the songs “Isn’t It Time,” which can now be viewed on YouTube.

Life After Death broke up in 1987 and in 1988 Bobby formed the group Spellbound with Paul ’Pablo’ Thomas . “We were getting better at writing songs and now could write music we were really into and grew up listening to. Basically Funk and Soul.” Spellbound went on to record a large musical catalog through the duo’s grass roots boutique label Selfish Recordings and in 2018 Spellbound released their 12th album “The Main Hustle.” A significant career event took place in 2008 when Bobby was able to invest in his own recording facility, Tripsville Studio. Bobby got back in touch with his roots as a studio engineer and began working on many projects from Tripsville. Later that same year he released his 1st self titled solo album “Bobby Moon.”

Today Bobby continues to write, record and produce with Spellbound, his solo project and anything musical that catches his fancy! In March 2018 Bobby started his own pod cast on RadioTitans.com called “Raw N Rawkin With Bobby Moon.” The show is an hour (or so) Podcast about the SoCal music scene including interviews with local bands and touring acts rolling through town. Sharing views and opinions on new albums, live shows and all things musical.

She contributed to the band’s critically-acclaimed release Receivers and completed several U.S. and European tours before leaving the band in July 2009. Noveller has toured supporting Xiu Xiu, the Jesus Lizard, Man Forever, and Emeralds. Lipstate is currently working with Carla Bozulich (Evangelista) on an improvised duo release for No Fun Productions.

In 2008, Lipstate performed as part of the Underground at the Abrons performance series at the Abrons Arts Center on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. That December, she played at the Un Son Par Là, Music of Today festival in Nîmes, France.

Along with 199 other guitar players, Lipstate performed in Chatham’s “A Crimson Grail” for 200 guitars which debuted at Lincoln Center’s Damrosch Park in August 2009. That October, the Manhattan New Music Project and the X Initiative co-presented a performance on the rooftop of the X Initiative where Lipstate debuted a new hand-painted 16mm film loop during a live set. In November, Lipstate performed with musician/choreographer Nancy Garcia in the premiere of Garcia’s program “Be The Climb” at The Kitchen, and opened several dates for the Jesus Lizard on their European and U.S. reunion tour. Lipstate debuted her improvised guitar duo with Carla Bozulich at NYC’s The Stone in February of this year. In March 2010, Noveller toured the U.S. supporting Xiu Xiu.

No Fun Productions released her debut LP Paint on the Shadows in April 2009. Following the release, Lipstate performed at No Fun Fest at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

Since forming in 2015, they've kept themselves busy — being personally requested to join the lineup of the 2017 Vans Warped Tour by founder Kevin Lyman, making a cameo appearance on the CW's The Originals (playing a queer werewolf-witch wedding, no less!), gaining ""Debut of the Year"" praise from Alternative Press, embarking on several national tours around America, and signing to Take This To Heart Records in 2019.
 
""Sarah and the Safe Word exists in two worlds, each a century apart. The first is set behind a haze of cigarette smoke in a speakeasy’s back room, where daring storytelling of swashbucklers and a hot rod-racing demon only complements an already theatrical stage show.

Pop infused dance numbers such as DamnLove offer a stark contrast to the melodic stylings of a song like ""Poison,"" which showcases Rubix's production abilities.

Self taught to play a variety of instruments, Rubix creates his own production soundscapes entirely by himself, often times playing every instrument in the song. Combined with his unique song writing talents, Rubix presents himself as one of the most versatile musicians out of Arizona. Others have taken notice, as Rubix has played massive events such as the 2015 Super Bowl Block Party in Phoenix and the Tucson Hip Hop Festival.

They are based in Kill Devil Hills, NC.

Founding members Dawn Moraga (guitar and vocals) and Tim Lusk (guitar) found each other (at a local computer repair shop owned by Tim) by chance while sharing a conversation about music. Realizing that they had so much in common (similar tastes in music, musician friends), this turned out to be the catalyst for their band’s formation. In late 2018, Lusk and Moraga added musicians and friends from the local scene to complete their lineup: Dana Quinn (on drums and vocals), and John Bliven (on bass). “We hit it off during our first practice. It's hard to explain, other than, we didn't want it to end,” says Cor De Lux’s Moraga. Their music, a mixture of post-punk and shoegaze, has earned their sound the tongue-in-cheek nickname referred to by friends and members of the band alike, as, a kind of… ‘Shoe-Gazi,’ (as it resembles a cross between shoegaze and the music of Dischord post-punk band, Fugazi). 

The band's debut album, Dream Life, was recorded and mixed in late 2019 over multiple sessions. It was mastered at Black Belt Mastering (by Levi Seitz). Just prior to completing its production at the pressing plant, Gotta Groove Records in Cleveland, Ohio, the band received word that Gotta Groove had to temporarily halt work due to the beginnings of the pandemic (mid-March, 2020). Fast-forward to July 2020, and the production for their debut was completed and released as an autographed variant on Milky Clear vinyl via a specialty seller, and as a non-autographed version in both Milky Clear and black vinyl, on the band's Bandcamp.

Growing up in Philadelphia on a steady diet of R&B, hip-hop, rock, blues, and soul music, Gilfillian gravitated to records that ignited his mind while making his body move. For him, listening to the towering icons of his musician father’s era—Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, The Temptations—was just as formative and exciting as discovering the new sounds of his own generation, and the beats and rhymes made by rising rap stars like Wu-Tang Clan, Kanye West, Notorious B.I.G., and Jay-Z inspired him in new ways. He began to recognize a connective thread in the sounds he loved best: from the golden throwbacks sampled by the hip-hop beat makers to the raw, emotional vocal deliveries of the Motown greats, for Gilfillian the key ingredient seemed to be the “soul”—not simply the genre, but the feeling and vibe.

Following his electrifying 2016 debut EP with upbeat singles like “High” and “Troublemaker” in 2018, Gilfillian signed to Capitol Records and hit the road––performing with the likes of Anderson East, Keith Urban, Gladys Knight, Kaleo, The Fray, Mavis Staples, and more. In early 2019, Gilfillian traveled to Africa to find healing and inspiration before headlining a tour in Scandinavia and opening for Brothers Osborne on their spring tour."

Two years later, Radio 4 released their second album, this time produced by the duo known as [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DFA,+The]DFA[/url]. This album was licensed by City Slang for distribution overseas.

From this album came the [r=208761] remix 12"", which set the band in a more club-oriented direction, carrying the already dance-rock sound further into dance realms. Subsequent work has included more club-friendly remixes and further distribution world-wide.

Coolzey stepped into the public eye around 2005 with a demo album and a series of exploratory DIY tours with rapper/comedian and friend Schaffer the Darklord. Interest spread quickly and Coolzey found himself touring alongside hip-hop legends from Brand Nubian and Jurassic 5 as well as punk rock heroes like Dead Milkmen. Coolzey’s first album ‘The Honey’ was released in 2010 and second official full-length ‘Hit Factory’ in 2013. In these albums as well as in a number of EPs, collaborations and side projects, he finds his niche as a songwriter, navigating hip-hop, rock, punk and pop in the spirit of genre defying influences such as Ween, Beck, The Beastie Boys and Outkast.

Coolzey’s love for multiple genres can also be evidenced in his record label Public School Records, which curates music from grimy underground hip-hop like Copywrite to the art pop of Belly Belt."

-ALTERNATIVE PRESS MAGAZINE

Through a career that spanned five full-length releases with his band Fat Opie, a struggle with a long-term illness and a career as a children’s book author and fine artist, Scott Mickelson has persevered. In 2015, Mickelson released his debut full-length Flickering which made the Grammy Ballot in two categories, “Best Folk Album” and “Best Roots Music Performance”. He now tours internationally. In addition, Mickelson  has made his name as a top record producer in the Bay Area with such projects as the critically acclaimed “Blanket The Homeless” and “After The Fire” compilations.
Mickelson appears in numerous publications both nationally and locally including NPR Radio, Jimmy Lloyd Show (NBC), Huffington Post, CBS Morning Show, No Depression, Paste, Glide Magazine, PopMatters, TheBayBridged, Alternative Press Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle, SF Weekly, and with the Folk Alliance. He also gained national recognition after winning a band search contest sponsored by MTV/7-Up with a prize of $15,000 and a song in the feature film Along The Way.
In the nineties, Fat Opie was managed by the legendary manager Elliot Roberts/Lookout Management (Neil Young, Tom Petty). While under contract in LA he had the opportunity to work side by side with Grammy arranger Jimmy Haskell (Steely Dan, Chicago, Simon & Garfunkel). At age seventeen he signed his first record deal with DSM Productions in NYC while playing infamous clubs like CBGB's. His colorful earlier years in NY included playing with Dave Van Ronk and receiving career guidance from Sid Bernstein (Beatles promoter).
Born and raised in Massachusetts, Mickelson has lived in the Bay Area since the 80’s. In San Francisco, Mickelson can be seen performing at the top venues including The Fillmore and Great American Music Hall. When not on tour, Mickelson produces from his Marin studio.
Mickelson’s second full-length record A Wondrous Life was released in May of 2018. Unlike Flickering which featured more than twenty of the best musicians in the Bay Area, A Wondrous Life is truly a solo effort. On it, he was not only the producer and engineer, but also performed nearly all the tracks except drums/horns. A Wondrous Life leans more towards an Alt-Rock sound and is his finest work to date. His forthcoming full-length Drowning In An Inflatable Pool is set for release August 15th.
Mickelson has opened for acts that include David Bromberg Quintet, Matt Nathanson, Larry Campbell and Terese Williams (Grammy producer), Jim Lauderdale (Grammy artist), Griffin House, Nick Lowe, Dr. John, Smashmouth, Jonathan Richman, Peter Case and Rob Hotchkiss (from Train, Grammy artist).

Mickelson offers fervently emotive vocals and melodic precision that reminds the ears of Steve Earle and Todd Snider. -GLIDE MAGAZINE

The combination of great hooks, a dynamic live show, and near constant coast-to-coast touring with bands such as Nada Surf, Motion City Soundtrack, The Get Up Kids, At the Drive-In and Fall Out Boy caught the attention of major and indie labels alike and in 1999 the band signed with Epic/550 Records, who re-released UFB’s second of three Ed Rose (The Get Up Kids, Touché Amore, The Appleseed Cast) produced albums, This Will Be Laughing Week. 

In 2018, news that a reunited Ultimate Fakebook were secretly working on new material started to get around, and the band was asked to join punk legends the Descendents on their North American tour. The energy and buzz the band felt from those shows has resulted in UFB's most personal and celebratory album to date - a record that will be released in early 2020."

The first single from that album was ""Desolate"", and a music video was released on YouTube on March 18, 2010.

The first single from that album, ""Live Today"" was released on Mediaskare Record's YouTube on July 22, 2011.

The group signed to Hopeless Records in 2014 and released their first full-length for the label, ""Free"", on June 12, 2015. In 2016, the band was rejoined by lead guitarist and original member Alex Blackwell IV after Blake Hardman departed. They released their fourth full-length ""RARE"" on June 16, 2017, which marked a radical change in sound, departing from their melodic hardcore sound in favor for an indie rock and shoegaze direction. The band has also since announced that they would not be performing any of their previous work live due to this. "

Five of the singles released by 999 between 1978 and 1981 charted within the Top 75 in the UK Singles Chart, with one further single released by 999 in 1978, Homicide, charting within the Top 40. In addition, as a result of extensive touring in the United States in the early 1980s, the band's third and fourth studio albums: The Biggest Prize in Sport and Concrete, each charted on the U.S. Billboard 200.

Despite having formed in 1976, 999 have only experienced two permanent changes to their original line-up and has continued to record and play live to the present day, leading AllMusic to describe the band as ""one of the longest-lived groups of the punk era."""

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

After an exhausting drive in a broken-down hearse, the brothers Renfield were shocked to discover that the America they had dreamed of visiting was much different than the place they had seen in horror films and E.C. Comics. There was no zombie plague as ""Day of the Dead"" had lead them to believe, Dr. Phibes was a fictional character and Ed Wood had died long before their young lives even began! Furthermore, the Renfields found their most beloved music scene in dire shape.

Transylvania, being what it is, new music releases are about 15 years behind. As a result, the Renfields find an America full of ""Nu-Metal"" and poppy MTV pseudo-punk rock bands. But where were their beloved punk rock heroes?

A trip to a New York cemetery would reveal the awful truth. It was there, standing at the graves of the dead Ramones that the teenage heroes decided to take a stand... Actually, it was more like a shovel! And with that shovel the brothers Renfield exhumed the corpses of the Ramones and expedited them back to the dark mountains of Transylvania.

Some quick work with a bone saw, a pair of rib spreaders and a few syringes of a life giving Reagent (not to mention a whole lot of pain and blood!) and each Renfield was given an impromptu heart transplant!

Now armed with the re-animated hearts of Rock and Roll's fallen heroes, the Renfields will resurrect the dead music scene with the horror of Transylvanian Pogo Punk!

The band was initially founded as a trio featuring vocalist Ben Weasel (also playing bass at the time), guitarist Jughead, and drummer Steve Cheese.  The group first called itself All-Night Garage Sale, but changed their name to Screeching Weasel after bassist Vinnie Bovine joined in December 1986.  Bovine would be fired in January 1988.  It would be the first of a number of line up changes that would affect the group's rhythm section throughout its lifespan.  Bassist Danny Vapid (initially called ""Sewercap"") joined the group in 1989.  The band split at the end of that year but reformed in 1991, at which time drummer Dan Panic joined the group.

Although the group's line-up continued to fluctuate (upon the 1991 reformation, Vapid would move to 2nd guitar and remain there until moving back to bass in 1993; three bassists passed through the band during that time), the line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Panic is considered ""classic"" by most Screeching Weasel fans.  The band split again in 1994 but reformed in 1996.  Vapid and Panic left the group the following year.  The bass position was filled by [a=Squirtgun] member Mass Giorgini, who had also recorded and produced a number of the group's releases.  Dan Lumley (also of Squirtgun) took over on drums and Zac Damon joined on 2nd guitar.  Damon left the band in 1998 but was not replaced until 2000, when Phillip Hill ([a=Teen Idols]) joined the group.  Although the band continued to record and release music at this time, the band did not play a single live show from late 1993 until mid 2000.  

Screeching Weasel split again in 2001, mainly due to Jughead's frustration with Ben Weasel's refusal to tour.  In 2004, a line up of Weasel/Jughead/Vapid/Giorgini/Lumley played some unannounced live shows around Chicago.

In 2009, Ben Weasel announced that he was resurrecting the Screeching Weasel name with Danny Vapid and three new members.  Founding member Jughead was noticeably and controversially absent.  Jughead would state, via his MySpace page, that neither Weasel nor Vapid informed him of their intention to revive Screeching Weasel and that he only learned of it through conversations with a fan, although it was later revealed that the split was due to a legal battle between Ben and Jughead over the band's assets and control of the Screeching Weasel name.

In March 2011, Screeching Weasel released ""First World Manifesto"", its first album of new material in 11 years.  Only a few days after the release, Ben was involved in an physical altercation with female heckler, as well as the club's female owner, at The Scoot Inn in Austin Texas, during the SXSW Festival.  The incident was caught on on video and shared on YouTube.  Shortly afterwards, the rest of SW announced they had left the group due to the incident.  Ben returned with a new line-up, which included former guitarist Zac Damon, several months later.

Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most ""punk"" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.

The original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7"" singles and 12"" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.

Following the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. 

Jerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, ""American Psycho"" and ""Famous Monsters"" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased ""resurrected"" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on ""indefinite hiatus"" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011 entitled The Devil's Rain. A live album, DeA.D. Alive, was released through Misfits Records in 2013 featuring songs from Graves/Jerry Era Misfits as well as a cover from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Several EPs were released in the following years including Horror Xmas, Vampire Girl, and Friday The 13th.

College aspirations seemed to put the band to an early end, and outside of a few house parties, the original group never played live.  Over the years, due to its crude sound and outrageous lyrics, ""Gacy's Place"" developed a cult following, finding such famous fans as [a=Steve Albini] and [a=Jello Biafra].

Soto then approached guitarist [a=Rikk Agnew], but Rikk recommended his younger brother, Frank, instead.  The line-up was rounded out by guitarist [a=John O'Donovan] and drummer [a=Peter Pan (10)].  

Rikk Agnew quickly changed his mind about playing in the band and O'Donovan and Pan were replaced by Rikk and his friend, [a=Casey Royer], respectively.

Tony left the following year and Rikk and Steve shared vocal duties for 1988's ""Balboa Fun Zone"".

The Adolescents remained dormant throughout the 1990s but members participated in a number of different bands.  In 2001, the Blue Album line-up reunited again to play shows live shows.  Casey Royer and Rikk Agnew soon bowed out but the band.  By 2006, Steve Soto and Tony Brandenburg were the only remaining members of the band's original line-up.  Backed by a revolving cast of guitarists and drummers, the band continued to record and tour, releasing a steady stream of albums throughout the 2010s.  In 2017, Casey Royer and Rikk Agnew launched the Radolescents, a group composed of various ex-Adolescents members dedicated to playing music from the Adolescents early days.

They were well known for their unique blend of raw, upbeat punk tunes backed with emphatic vocals. There really was never an “SWG sound”. Their influences ranged from many bands including Fifteen, Face To Face, Quit, Big Drill Car, All, Rhythm Collision, and even Crass on occasion. They originally formed from the remains of an old band called M.N.F.S.T., and went on to release several 7” records, 1 full length, and copious unreleased tracks on scattered compilation releases. Shower With Goats frontman and founder, Steve Neurotic, decided to end the band in February 2000 for numerous reasons. From 2000 to the late 2003, Steve ran the infamous punk website, Poppunk.Com. In March of 2007, Steve met up with long time fans of SWG, Ed Arson and Daryl Goat to jam out some of the old songs for fun, on a trip to see his folks. The practice so well that Steve finally caved in and decided he wanted to do a reunion show with Ed and Daryl. On May 26th, 2007 history was made, as the band played a reunion show to a packed house at Trenton, New Jersey’s Mill Hill Basement. This show made a decision to revive the band part time.

In December 2008, Shower With Goats entered a recording studio for the first time in over 8 years to record 13 new songs. The result was the album ""Reflection"", which was shelved by the band after only 40-50 copies made it out into the wild.

In early 2013 Bassist Daryl Goat left the band and Jony Mo joined. They recorded a 2 song benefit for the FreeAnons organization (An organization that benefits arrested participants of the hacktivist collective ""Anonymous"").

In early 2014 after the passing of his mother, Steve relocated to Texas.

In late 2013 Steve started a side/solo project called ""Steve and the Neurotics"", which he continues to release music under to this day.

In August and September 2020, the shelved ""Reflection"" album, was remixed and mastered by Arik Victor at Creep Studios in Philadelphia. It was released on October 6th, 2020 under the new title ""This Is Not A Reflection..."" with altered artwork, and some new parts recorded and added. 

Steve has begun writing the next Shower With Goats release. Plans are to record in January 2021 with a Summer 2021 release date."

Original line-up was: Poffen - vocals / Lanchy - guitar / Andreas - bass. Drummer Spennart joined the band a bit later but quit during the summer of 1986. He was replaced by Jörgen who was a guitarist originally. In 1987 Jörgen introduced Jesper, a friend whom with he had a two-piece band (TGU). He took over the drums and Jörgen started playing the second guitar. After releasing a string of 7''s the band went on hiatus in 1990. They also did a fanzine at that time called Antisystem. 

In 1994 Finn Records proposed a reforming of the band and released their first LP ""Sin Egen Motståndare"". Line-up this time was Poffen, Lanchy, Andreas and Jallo on drums. From '94 to 2000 the band continued to record but rarely played live. After releasing another LP, two split LP's (with Dismachine and Disclose) and a few singles they decided to disband again at the end of 2000.

After 6 years without recording sessions, they returned to the studio one last time and Prank released their third LP ""Vi Är Eliten""."

 With the release of their debut full length record, “Find Sense. Feel Love. Make Light.” The band has clearly held nothing back.

MU330's lineup has changed frequently, but the foundations of the band remained intact — Potthast, Diebold, Bell, and Moll.

The band is self-described as ""psycho ska"" and are known for their lively performances and a general ethic of fun and optimism. At the shows spectators encouraged to do the power skank, where fans hold their arms straight out in front of them and jog in place. They have been known to break out chainsaws and other wacky devices during their shows, proclaiming themselves the ""Kings of Rock and Roll"".

Their lyrics cover many topics, from racism to love songs to testicular cancer. Their lyrics, as well as the band, has matured since their inception in 1994. In their debut album they had songs like Danska, Stuff, and Fleeba (about a smelly girlfriend, being horny, and being fat, respectively) to newer more mature themes. They also changed their sound from a farther out, more experimental ska songs to a more mainstream sound.

Singer Dan Potthast has also released solo work."

Predetermined in the mind of The Reanimator at The Void, Grave Robber was unleashed upon an unsuspecting, pre-apocalyptic Earth, A.D. 2005.

As wounded and mutilated souls suffering curses unfathomable, death was their eternal verdict. Once submitting to The Reanimator as their Master, inviting The Ghost to indwell within them, and electing to die to themselves, the zombie slaves escaped the clutches of the grave.

Now, these devil's rejects arm themselves with sonic, vibratory executions and images of horrific realities, bringing an onslaught of sound and warning that will ring into eternity. Rest assured, you will be afraid. You will be very afraid.

Fans of The Misfits, Alice Cooper, Type O Negative, Gwar, Kiss, Danzig, and Rob Zombie will find themselves feeling as though they strolling in familiar musical history, yet simultaneously wading through a dense mire of uncharted territory. There’s nothing more terrifying than the unknown. Grave Robber is the one band that can hold your hand on a decidedly horrifying romp, leading you safely to the other side.

Heed the call of Grave Robber. Die and escape the grave, or die eternally."

With members hailing from Austin, Texas and Auckland, New Zealand, and a musical pedigree that includes bands such as My Education, Lost Rockets, Body Corporate and Deathbeam, Swallow the Rat offers a unique mix of NZ Post-punk and Texan Psychedelia. 

Forming in Auckland in late 2017, Swallow the Rat wasted no time and quickly set to work recording with acclaimed engineer Nick Abbott. In March 2019 they performed multiple shows at SXSW in Austin, TX, and a self titled 7"" was released in support of the tour. A string of performances across New Zealand followed, including opening for No Age, Gang Of Four, and Sebadoh.

Subsequently, they signed to Shifting Sounds for the April 2020 release of their debut album 'Leaving Room'.

Raimond both moved to Nürnberg Germany in 1985, where Joseph B. Raimond bought an analog 8-track recording studio and began to record what has since become a huge body of recorded work. The concept of DWM though from the very beginning was to combine music, graphic art, painting, sculpture, poetry and just about every other medium of art into one project. The open-membership policy of DWM is an important part of the DWM philosophy.In the early 1990's, Bernard H. Worrick moved to Florida, taking with him an important part of the group's identity. But DWM has continued onwards without Bernard. Bringing Bernard back to Germany and returning him to the DWM fold has become one of the goals of the group. Although rarely playing live, DWM is not averse to live concerts, although playing live is not one of the priorities of the group. Since the departure of Bernard, DWM has become especially interested in collaborative efforts with other artists, both recorded and live. Recent developments with DWM include the formation of a new label within MT Undertainment devoted exclusively to the recordings, literature and artwork by DWM and its various members."

Joe and his brother, Mike (keyboards, vocals, & occasional songwriting), have been the only constant members of the band since its formation in the mid 1970s.  The band spawned from the same scene the launched such bands as [a=Black Flag], [a=Redd Kross], the [a=Descendents], and the [a=Circle Jerks].  The early line-ups also included another Nolte brother, David, on bass and Vitus Mataré on keyboards and flute.  In 1979, this line-up (including drummer Jack Reynolds), recorded their first album, ""LA Explosion!"", now considered a classic amongst the band's fans.  In 1980, the band, with new drummer John Frank, recorded a follow up titled ""Look Again"" but the band was unable to secure a record deal and the release was scrapped.  The following years were spent dealing with various line-up changes.  In 1983, ""Painting Smiles On A Dead Man"", a collection of demos, was released.  In 1985, following more line up changes, the band split.

In 1987, Joe and Mike resurrected the band with a new line up that included Luke Lohnes (guitar), Larry Manke (bass), and Dave Nazworthy (drums) and signed a deal with [l=SST Records].  In 1988 ""Confession"" appeared, followed in 1989 by ""Awakening"".  Unfortunately for the band, neither album sold very well and ""Awakening"" cost so much to produce that it allegedly caused severe repercussions for the label.  Despite this, SST was willing to do another album with the band, but Joe Nolte was so disillusioned by the group's 1989 tour that it took some time to get motivated for a new record.  The band began recording a follow-up in 1991 but, due to scheduling issues, the record was not completed until 1994.  After that, the band got caught up in a contract renegotiation with SST that delayed the release even further and the final product, entitled ""Gin & Innuendoes"" did not appear until 1996.  The Last did not release another album until 2013's ""Danger"", which saw Joe and Mike backed by longtime friends and fans Karl Alvarez and Bill Stevenson of the [a=Descendents].  Their long-lost second album, ""Look Again"", finally saw official release in 2020.

P.H.F. or Perfect Hair Forever is a primarily Lo-Fi Pop-Punk band combining the elements of high school emotion and anxiety along with the melodic but harsh wailing of electric guitar and pounding percussion.
While this has been the most common of their sound in most recent years, styles have ranged from nostalgic sounding Rock & Roll, Surf Rock, and even some Doo-Wop in there.

Perfect Hair Forever finds their origins as a bedroom band started by Joe Locke, recording songs in his parent's bathroom when they weren't home in 2008.
Joe got his start in music with a band in high school he shared with four other girls that apparently didn't last very long when everybody in the band began to move away.
So Joe kept to himself about music after that.

When Joe releases a song on the internet he will completely dump and destroy any recording material made previous to uploading it.
He's said he does this so that he never hears it again. ""I don't need it anymore and I don't want to be able to change it anymore so for me it makes sense to get rid of it.""

While at first trying to remain anonymous while producing under the moniker of Perfect Hair Forever, Joe eventually broke free of this and is now a full band composed of
Nigel Wright - Bass
Reuben Winter - Drums
Sam Wieck - Guitar
Joe Locke - Vocals

Joe has said he pulls influence from Buddy Holly, Lou Christie, and Perry Como and considers them his, ""Holy Trinity""

Joe picked the name ""Perfect Hair Forever"" from a short lived show on Adult Swim by the same name, made by the same team behind Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
He now normally goes by ""P.H.F."" presumably to distance the band from the show or just to make a long name shorter while still hanging onto the original name."

Formed in Los Angeles in 2008 by original members of Phobia, Mange and Eat the Living.
Released their 2010 full-length debut on Deep Six Records entitled “Critical Failure”. Song topics ranged from political indignity, religious strife to personal turmoil. The music, a crushing powerhouse of Swedish influenced D-Beat punk, mixed with ripping metal and thrash, backed by traditionally aggressive punk vocals. 

Returning from a Europe tour in 2011, a new singer was found in Jon Tomala adding an even heavier element and more raw sound to the already thick D.I.S. mix. Evolving their sound with more aggressive vocals and finally cementing a tight lineup.

Their second album “Becoming Wrath” was recorded and mixed mid 2012 at Architeuthis Sound in North Hollywood by the bands own Sean Vahle. Released on Deep Six Records in early 2013 “Becoming Wrath” is both powerfully violent, and sonically crushing, capturing D.I.S. at its best and most ferocious. 

Throughout various shows and touring in 2014 in support of ""Becoming Wrath"", three new songs were recorded and produced for a pending EP release. 2015 will bring a new album for Destroyed In Seconds along with various touring plans and shows worldwide.

Big Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit. The band's lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career.  They booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands."

They had to wait until 1997 to unleash their first single Electrocute (later covered by The Hellacopters on their last album Head Off) and their 1998 Thomas Skogsberg produced debut mini album “Demons” Come Bursting Out! The band was contracted to Gearhead Records between 1999 and 2004 and released three full length albums for them. The label constructed a new genre for the band, punk ‘n’ roll, which is widely used these days. After Gearhead they turned down several larger labels and one big time producer in favor of managing themselves and designing, producing and putting out their own records (as well as collaborating with other independent labels). Despite the band’s efforts, hard work and pushing Scandinavian rock overseas they have remained underground and even obscure in their home country. However, there is no question of their importance to the late ’90s early 2000s punk and garage scenes. Unlike so many of their peers “DEMONS” never quit playing. "

After releasing 3 albums, 2010's ""Immaculada"", 2011's ""Leave Home"" and 2012's ""Open Your Heart"" (all on Sacred Bones Records) Ben Greenberg replaced Hansell on bass in 2012.

Valencia met by playing local shows together around the tri-state area in separate bands. George Ciukurescu and JD Perry grew up together; attending elementary school, high school, and their first year of college. They joined a band in 2001 called The Capgun Heroes with Brendan Walter and former members Sean Mundy and Ryan O'Hara. Shane Henderson sang in the band Attracted to Miss and Max played drums in The Emphasis. They formed the band that is known today as Valencia in 2004. The band is named after the wife of the protagonist, Valencia, in the book by Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. In 2005 Valencia signed to I Surrender Records after the label's owner, Midtown's drummer Rob Hitt, heard their demo tape.[2]

After playing the Warped Tour in 2005,[3] they released their first album, This Could Be a Possibility, in October 2005, which was re-released in September 2006. The album has received mixed reviews.[4][5][6][7] In 2006, the band was named SPIN Band of the Day and was a finalist for Band of the Year, but lost to Nightmare of You.[8] In May 2006 the band stopped touring because of the death of Shane's girlfriend.[9] In July 2006 Valencia traveled to Japan to play the Fuji Rock Festival. In 2007 the band toured with Boys Like Girls, The Audition and All Time Low in the U.S.[10] Valencia also toured with We the Kings, The Cab, Charlotte Sometimes, and Sing it Loud in April 2008.

From band site:

""Post-genre power trio mssv was formed early in 2019 when guitarist Mike Baggetta joined up with bassist Mike Watt (MINUTEMEN, fIREHOSE, The Stooges) and drummer Stephen Hodges (Mavis Staples, Tom Waits, David Lynch) to tour on his Wall of Flowers album (BIG EGO Records, featuring Watt and drumming legend Jim Keltner). After a hugely successful US tour performing music that ran the gamut from original electro-free-jazz improvisations, driving new-rock anthems and covers from The Stooges and Watt’s first punk rock opera “Contemplating the Engine Room”, mssv has proved a fearless band.

Featuring live electronic processing by both Baggetta and Hodges, as well as Watt’s relentlessly driving bass and vocals, mssv not only shows what it means to be a band in the modern post-genre landscape, but is well on their way to defining it."""

Growing up near the rust belt city of South Bend, IN, he spent his high school years in and out of various rudimentary electronic and absurdist noise projects. Around this time he began using the name Freeze Etch to refer to his solo electronic works in progress, which became his primary musical vessel in the 00s and beyond.

While promoting his first self-released EP 'Somnambulist' online, the release caught the attention of emerging UK label Fleshmadeword Records, who selected a track from it to highlight on their debut compilation album in 2002. The label rebranded as Immanence Records, and went on to release his next EP 'Helios' in 2003. These releases constituted his first international exposure.

While attending college in Bloomington, IN, Adam connected with the local music community for some of his early live performances and DJ sets, self-releasing the 'Pejorative' EP in 2007. He then connected with Boston label Force Of Nature Productions, who released his first full-length album 'Vessels' in 2008, and collected content from the 'Helios' and 'Pejorative' EPs for digital reissue in 2009. He did some remixing and compilation appearances around this time, including contributing 2 tracks to Chicago-based Tympanik Audio's debut compilation album.

After moving back to South Bend and going on a temporary hiatus, 2017 saw the release of the odds-and-ends collection 'Not Today' by Boston label Voidstar Productions, as well as his return to live performance, culminating in his second proper full-length album (2020's 'All Context Vanishes'). The COVID years were spent on many remix collaborations, and an expanded and remastered version of 'All Context Vanishes' was released by Providence-based Component Recordings in 2023. He resumed live performance and DJing in the post-COVID era, including curating the CAULDRON event series in South Bend."

Synthesizer devotee who has had 3 major stages in his career: first as a solo artist (with Dan Lacksman Association), then as a member of the successful and witty [a9221], and lastly as a producer and sound-engineer for a lot of projects in the nineties.

As a solo artist, he recorded 7 singles (and also one together with [a=Two Man Sound], another Belgian group) and one album. The core of his sound was the Moog organ. From the end of the seventies onwards, Lacksman was the sound engineer behind the elektropop-pioneers [a9221], of which he was also a member. 

In the nineties, he came to the forefront once again through his work as a producer for the French project [a=Deep Forest], a mix between the African chants of the rain forest and current technology.  He produced their critically acclaimed and best-selling [url=http://www.discogs.com/Deep-Forest-Deep-Forest/master/4658]debut album[/url] (he took over a year to produce it), but decided not to cooperate with the group on their next recordings because ""I wanted to get even more into the studio side of things. The others wanted to make Deep Forest a 'live' thing. I feel this kind of music stands on its own for what it is, exploring these great sounds. I consider the studio my musical instrument."" He then formed his own ""exotic"" project called [a71181]. From the bio at Elektra : Pangea comes from the Greek word ""Pan"" meaning one. Gea comes from the Greek ""Geos"" meaning earth. The whole idea of ""one earth,"" a sense of unity, that we are all unified, appeals to me very much. Combine that concept with my respect for technology - look at the internet for example and how it is making us all one continent again, in a way - and you can see where my ideas come from.""

For Tedo Stone, a lifetime of listening to classic country and soul artists like Patsy Cline and Otis Redding imbued the young songwriter with a retro pop and strong vocal appreciation from a young age, though finding his own voice has been an ongoing process. His 2013 debut album, Good Go Bad, saw Tedo delving into glam jams and alt country rock, though Stone admits he wasn’t fully assured of his sound yet. While hanging out in Athens, Georgia and playing with the endless array of talented young musicians there, Stone realized his songs were sounding different live, evolving into a mixture of Dinosaur Jr’s wailing guitars and Neil Young’s raw emotion; and he liked it. Taking that new energy into the studio he churned out 2015's Marshes and 2018's Summer Sun to glowing reviews.
2020 will find Tedo Stone releasing his 4th full length album again made in Athens, GA. The new song ""Same Old Kid"" comes from the currently untitled album and will serve as the album's teaser of things to come. More information coming very soon."

Since late 2005, HTH have released 7 Albums, 2 EP's, 1 B-Sides Compilation, and, here on Bandcamp, some other weird releases and bootlegs available too cuz we know you like to go deep.
Hallelujah The Hills have been releasing critically acclaimed albums and touring the U.S. since 2007. Described by Spin as “criminally underappreciated” and lauded by Pitchfork for their “fist pumping anthems,” they’ve been declared “Boston legends” in their hometown and as having a “cult following” by Stereogum. The band released their first two albums on Misra Records, assisted Titus Andronicus in recording their breakout album The Monitor, and are one of the only bands to have ever toured with The Silver Jews. Their sound was creatively explained as “the kind of punk rock you’d expect on stage at the roadhouse from ‘Twin Peaks’” in The Boston Herald. Others go further, with Aquarium Drunkard noting “few do it with the style and imagination of Hallelujah the Hills” and Captain’s Dead boldly publishing that they “without a doubt they are one of the greatest bands currently making music.”
Band founder and songwriter Ryan H. Walsh’s debut book, Astral Weeks: A Secret History of 1968 (Penguin Press), received rave reviews from The New Yorker, The Guardian, Rolling Stone, and was a New York Times end-of-year Critics’ Pick in 2018. I’m You, the seventh full-length album from Hallelujah The Hills, was written in the months after the book’s release (even incorporating Astral Weeks’ flute player John Payne into the band for the achingly dreamy song “It Still Floors Me”). Kicking off the record with these mirror-plated lyrics, “Hello I am the person singing this song / and if you think that might be you, well I guess you might not be wrong,” I’m You attempts to erase the border between performer and listener, singer and audience, band and fans. The album digs so deep into the concept of self-identity that, by the time the final song ends, you might just feel like me. If there was a Venn diagram featuring these two overlapping circles—wildly triumphant and overwhelming melancholy—the overlap zone would be where I’m You lives.

Full of highs and lows and a boatload of hook laden guitar rock. In the early 90's, Bill Stone, Kurt Maracz and Tom Dannery formed up Medicine Men (later Medicine Show). They shared a love of Big Star, the Posies, Teenage Fanclub and everything that those bands laid their foundations on. They played a lot of shows, garnered a catalog brimming with guitar jangle, and then, like bands do, simply spun themselves apart. Bill Stone and Kurt Maracz, along with the Rick McBrien of Detroit, and John E Midnight (late of WRUW's Dig Baby Dig fame) formed the successful and legendary Paranoid Lovesick. For a time they had all the labels in frenzy and fueled it's mystique by recording but not releasing two full lengths. Cleveland Ohio's answer to the Replacements, called up to the big game, then back down to double AA ball. It all crashed for good with the sudden and unexpected death of Rick McBrien. Devastated, Stone, Maracz and Midnight chose to bow out gracefully in honor of their late friend. During most of Paranoid Lovesick's high water mark, Maracz was keeping ties with Dannery and the Medicine Show. Like Paranoid Lovesick, Medicine Show was stumbling, recording amazing tracks which never saw the light of day. Enter Pat Kirchner in 2006. A school friend of Dannery and Maracz. Pat played with the Snyders of Berlin way back when Pat's in the Flats was the place to be. A persistent Kirchner managed to bring together Stone, Dannery and Maracz again. This time they were armed with years of experience and a dictionary sized song catalog. Maracz, who's experienced a renaissance with his writing, mostly pens the latest batch of songs. With a nod to their past, the band still plays select Paranoid Lovesick and Medicine Show songs. This time, with nothing holding it all together other than the sheer love of music, there's a much better vibe with the Dragster. Gone is everything that can screw up the fragile thing that is a rock band. In exchange is a bag of hard learned tricks that combined cook up some great guitar hook laden rock. An elite SWAT team of rock, ready to make pinpoint surgical rock strikes whenever they feel the urge to exit the basement (which isn't often). "

To support the record, Scary put together a touring band – ALSO called The Shredding Tears. Backing Scary’s vocals and keyboards were second keyboardist Mike Acreman, guitarist Graham Norwood, bassist David Ostrem, and drummer Brian Bauer.

Scary and his band soon began to draw a large word of mouth following, due to there glam, theatrical stage show. Each song was given its own glittering visual representation, complete with wacky costumes and set pieces all of which was filtered through the darkly comedic mind and maniacal stage persona of Bryan Scary.The band drew comparisons to Queen, ELO, Sparks, and Of Montreal, among other artists unafraid to court the dramatic. 

After some heavy touring, Scary and the band returned to the studio to begin crafting the next album, the first to feature his touring ensemble.

It was a conceptual work inspired in-part by Thomas Pynchon’s epic novel “Against The Day,” with nearly every song delineating a tale of flight, airships, or the wild blue yonder. The record got heady with interwoven themes of innocence lost and the uses of enchantment. It opened with a magical fairy-tale and closed with a cynical commentary on that same fairy tale. Fanciful, poppy and psychedelic (albeit with a glamorous 70′s bend), the material on FLIGHT OF THE KNIFE was built around ADD-inflicted arrangements and liberal genre-playing, as the band careened from jazz to funk to classical to country to music-hall.

On the 1st April 2008, [b]Flight of the Knife[/b] by Bryan Scary and the Shredding Tears, was on Black and Greene Records.

Critical acclaim began to pour in - the album received praise from Pitchfork, SPIN, Rolling Stone, MTV and other delectable periodicals. It was the “Editor’s Pick” on iTunes and rocketed to the top-30 albums in a day. It was also ranked No. 6 in their ""Rock Albums"" section as well.

The acclaim of FLIGHT OF THE KNIFE led to two years of touring, which got brought to an abrupt end whilst in Mid-tour in L.A. While preparing to record an EP for Elijah Woods’ Simian Record, the band’s van and trailer was stolen, along with all of their gear! Tour derailed the band were stuck in L.A. The band being ever resilient used this time to finish up the 5 track EP for Simian. Most of that EP was produced by the new no.2 member Jonathan Sadoff. Later, Scary added a 6th track produced with Bryce Goggin (Apples in Stereo, Pavement).

The completed [b]Mad Valentines EP[/b] was released in late 2009.

Aloud is a four-piece rock n’ roll band fronted by songwriting team Henry Beguiristain and Jen de la Osa. The two have written songs together since their teens growing up in Miami, Florida. Beguiristain and de la Osa moved to Boston shortly after high school to form Aloud. Over the years, they have created a catalog of songs wide in range, but always influenced by the 60s soul and rock music they grew up on—with a particular affection for harmonies. While the two each have their own distinctive vocal style they are at their best singing together. The two married in 2010.

Aloud’s music has been featured on NPR’s Innovation Hub where it has the honor of being the show’s theme song, ESPN, FOX TV and just recently on a national TV spot for Ashley Furniture. The band has been written about in the Huffington Post, Elmore Magazine, Impose, the Boston Globe, and Time Out to name a few. They play regularly in the northeast, have done two national tours and have been invited several times to the CMJ and SXSW music festivals, and have shared the stage with acts such as Lady Lamb, Lake Street Dive, Cage the Elephant, Alpha Rev, and Hunter Valentine."

Dancing with Ghosts is an electronic-infused alternative rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, The band was started by Josh Cannon in 2015. After multiple attempts to work within a traditional band dynamic, Josh ventured off on his own and began writing, recording and performing his own music.

In 2017, upon the release of Dancing with Ghosts' first full link release ""Koyaanisqatsi"", Stephanie Conner, enthralled with the sound, joined the band, playing keyboard and vocals.

Stephanie contributed her vocal talents on the band's second album ""The Nightmare Inside You"", which was released in March of 2018. Along the way, Josh and Stephanie have been producing numerous music videos, which have garnered thousands of views on their Youtube channel. These videos, which have a wide cast of characters from demons, goddesses, deranged priests, witches, cage dancers and more, often lyrically feature mental illness as a underlying theme- something they both know all too well.

Both members of Dancing with Ghosts are affected with varying levels of anxiety, panic disorders, and O.C.D. They have both sought to combat mental struggles throughout their lives by pushing this manic energy into creating something. These struggles are usually found at the forefront of many of Dancing with Ghosts' lyrics.

Dancing with Ghosts has taken a ""do it yourself"" approach to every aspect of the band, from videos, effects, makeup, photography, music production, booking, etc- something they take great pride in. 

When it comes to live performance, Dancing with Ghosts strive to make each show a completely unique experience from your typical act. Large screens adorn the stage with video and imagery that go right in sync with the music. This is one of the key aspects that set DWG apart from other live shows. They aim to truly envelope you in the experience by not just hearing, but seeing something special. Whether they're reprising one of the many ghoulish characters from their music videos or pelting you with glow sticks, Dancing with Ghosts wants you to escape from reality for a while."

He has lived and studied in many countries.  When he was two years old, his family moved to the UK.

He began studying piano at age six and later guitar and drums as a teenager.  He is an alumnus of the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston (MA), where he attended on a scholarship and graduated Magna Cum Laude.

Fellow Seasurfer member Mikel Wegener was brought on for bass and guitarist/drummer Neil Burkdoll of Florida’s Whimsical rounded out the lineup.

Opening on the abrasively industrial “War Planets,” We are Loveblind aim and succeed in creating an album completely alien up against their previous bands. Where single “Daydream” fully lives up to its title in soaring dream pop, “White Piano Black Dress” (featuring Ringo Deathstarr’s Elliott Frazier) isn’t afraid to switch gears and careen towards earth with massive, shoegazing guitar work and chirpy synth percussion.

With Electrique’s vocals kept front and center guiding Sleeping Visions, its ten songs aim to interpret dreams with as much lucidity as our waking states, but Visions is far from a half-awake listen.

Intelligent pop, dreamy folk and literate rock
""The Corner Laughers are a Californian band who come across like a West Coast Belle and Sebastian. Their indie pop is sassy and smart, intelligent and intricate, twee with bite."" -- Paul Lester, The Guardian UK
It's the beginning of the third decade of the 21st Century, and California indie-pop band THE CORNER LAUGHERS have been with us for a while now – since their 2006 debut, throughout three more albums and in other manifestations such as Karla Kane and KC Bowman’s recent solo records, the enigmatic Agony Aunts, and a number of other collaborations with kindred spirits.
After 2015’s critically acclaimed Matilda Effect, the future of The Corner Laughers was unclear. Circumstances of geography, health and other life complications conspired to push the tight-knit quartet temporarily apart. Temescal Telegraph, the new album out soon via Big Stir Records, stands as a joyful testament to the band being back in full bloom.
While past projects have drawn from a variety of guest contributions from around the globe, for their 2020 return, Kane (vocals, ukulele and most songwriting), Charlie Crabtree (drums) Bowman and Khoi Huynh (sharing guitar, bass and piano duties) recorded their new LP quickly and entirely in the intimate setting of Bowman’s Timber Trout studio in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, fostering an organic, cohesive and present sound.
But now, as at the start, they are not of this era. They are timeless, but far from “retro”: Yes, you will detect strains of English folk-psych (peak period Kinks by way of Fairport Convention, perhaps), vintage California sunshine pop and hints of alt-country twang. You may be reminded of the literate lyrics and soaring melodies of '80s titans like XTC, Kirsty MacColl and Robyn Hitchcock, or the '90s indie chamber pop of the likes of Belle & Sebastian. Kane's lilt and uke might even lead one to expect a postmodern YouTube sensation (make no mistake, she was there first).
With the exception of that last one, none of those touchstones are, strictly speaking, off base. But they're not why a Corner Laughers record will leave you feeling temporally displaced in an eerily giddy manner. That's down to the songs, built upon what Icon Magazine calls a “nigh-on-perfect fusion of bubblegum-sweet tunefulness and clever, subtly barbed lyrics.”
Temescal Telegraph plays with micro and macro lenses, connecting deeply personal experiences to the cosmic scale. Consider ""The Accepted Time"", which explores how an everyday walk in one’s hometown can also be an entire universe, or “Lord Richard,” one of several songs that somehow contain the life-death cycle, ecological doom and a hope of redemption in a catchy package. Expect to encounter bees in harmony, witches, ghosts, fallen leaves and omniscient vultures. Moods meander between wistful melancholy and exhilaration. To quote another song, “It’s alright to care.”
These are works full of wit and whimsy which might easily be unfolding “anywhen”, or in several epochs at once. They're all strikingly immediate, but thoroughly unanchored to any conventional notion of “now.” And that's the thematic thread tying together Temescal Telegraph -- a notion of the present alongside, or perhaps even versus, the eternal."

Mercy Choir is the songwriting and recording project of New Haven, CT based musician Paul Belbusti. Since 2004, Belbusti has produced a large quantity of critically acclaimed music ranging from abstract experiments to more traditional pop and rock and roll, released both digitally and physically on his own imprint (Dead Language Records) and collaboratively. Mercy Choir, as a recording project, is generally Belbusti alone (with a few exceptions), recording in his home studio with a mixture of analog and digital instruments and techniques. As a live band, Mercy Choir is a shifting and evolving entity. Many musicians and friends pass through. Join and rejoin. Contributing arrangements and breathing new life into songs that may have started as crude, lofi, sketches. The Mercy Choir discography is joyously uneven and unpredictable.

Currently at work on their 9th album, DEUX ANGES, (expected release June 2020, on Slugg Records), the signature interweaving of spoken word into the band’s work is described by the UK’s Norman Records as “a cross between Slowdive and Laurie Anderson - a late night radio transmission drifting to us, half asleep in bed”.

Forging an unique sound well serves the new songs Serafin-Wells began writing after the tragic loss of his partner, BPX co-founder, Summer Serafin, who passed away in 2011, just 31.

As Michael told Indiemusic’s Raphael Duprez in a feature about the band (February 2017): “All of this is entirely for her. I often say that our music, each album, is of, for and about her. Summer remains an integral part of the band - not only as its inspiration but, because I have an archive of her isolated tracks, her vocals grace each new album as I write songs and fly in her voice. Summer isn’t the main reason BPX goes on, she’s the only reason. She is the reason. And I think I can trust that I’m doing things for the right reason if I always know the reason for it is her. Not out of any ambition other than to honor and conjure her. She’s my conscience.""  "

Under his main project, Shady Monk produces electronic music containing influences from various genres, often incorporating significant use of bells, elements of jazz, classical piano, vgm/chip-tune, funk, glitch-hop and much more, with a heavy emphasis on chords and melody and cinematic or orchestral undertones. While some of his work may contain vocals on occasion, either of his own or from featured guests, the majority of Shady Monk's work tends to be instrumental in nature, conveying feelings, emotions, and settings through music."

The bands spearhead, Dave New, grew up in Baltimore, where he fell in love with music and began helming his own grade school bands while pursuing his prodigious hobby of home recording. Dave moved to Dayton, Ohio in 2011 where he met his female counterpoint Vivienne Machi. Together they began cutting their teeth in a variety of Dayton area venues, recording under the moniker Babbling April, which reached its current incarnation after they relocated to Washington, DC, adding the rhythm section of Ben Medina and Ben Melrod.

Babbling April put out their first EP, On Breath, in February 2015, landing a Noisetrade “New and Notable” feature and plenty of Hypem love. Since then they have continued a tireless schedule, self-recording and self-releasing every song they’ve written while building a dedicated following in the DC underground scene. The act of playing and recording has come to represent a joyful reprieve for the band, much of whom works government jobs in the DC metro area. “With the 24/7 news cycle filling our heads with tweets, statistics, spreadsheets and talking points, we’ve come to regard our time in Babbling April as a beautiful escape” the band concedes. 

Recorded and mixed in Dave and Vivi’s basement, the band’s newest EP, Holy Gold, is a testament to the joy Babbling April imbue their music with. Acoustic-meets- shoegaze guitar pop ambience echoes across each track as fevered bass lines and distinct vocal textures weave through. The compositions tend to change tempo and morph beneath the ear-wormy melodies, conjuring up the work of Yo La Tengo, Built to Spill and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, amongst a wealth of alternative bands of the ’90’s. “The songs are often bittersweet snapshots of the ephemeral nature of life” Dave reflects. “Friends grow apart, places are never the same, but a few perfect memories will always remain.”"

As the hysteria at their local shows steadily increases, so does their reputation with local law enforcement, forcing them daily more to seek employment anywhere but home. While snooping cops seeking to stamp out indiscriminate behavior scour the borders of their homestead the Nude Ranch, the group has prodigally exiled themselves and are staying scarce with a string of self booked tours and one night stands which have linked them up with with such likes as The Growlers, The Oblivians, La Luz, Night Beats, and King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard. 
Their stripped down and bare bone sound, akin to the British Invasion being transplanted back into the Carolina mountains, has so far proven to have been unrecordable… until now. The secret? Sticking to the obvious and going down into a sweaty basement with a few mics, fewer clothes and a revolving door of comrades and goddesses falling by for as long as they can take the heat. Lately the Nudes have even gotten good at playing with their clothes on. However if any audience member feels the need to participate in the spirit of exhibitionism the stakes at the Party will unblinkingly be called and raised."

Quiet Hollers formed in Louisville around singer-songwriter Shadwick Wilde, and violinist/multi-instrumentalist Aaron West in 2010.  Their alt. country-styled debut, I Am the Morning, came in 2013, spawning a cult following via some critical praise, allowing the band to tour heavily, where changes in personnel and musical direction saw the band exploring territory beyond their beginnings.   

In 2015, a birthday-cake adorned self-titled sophomore album introduced the band to a broader audience, drawing praise both for the breadth of its various influences and for Wilde’s songwriting. The album and it's breakout single, ""Mont Blanc"" brought the band to Europe for the first time.  Sadly, by the end of the album and tour cycle, tensions in the band led to the departure of longtime drummer, videographer, and collaborator Nick Goldring.    

 In 2017, Quiet Hollers signed with indie label SonaBLAST! for their third LP, helmed by producer/drummer Dave Chale (Low Cut Connie, Wax Fang).  Drawing sonic and thematic parallels between the modern day and the 1970s– exploring spirituality, agnosticism, toxic masculinity, and mental illness in another decade marred by division, corruption, and violence.   

In late 2018, the band released the single ""Addicted,"" with a new album in the works as the band continues to tour, with the lineup of Rafael Freitas on drums, and Shelley Anderson on bass, after keyboardist Jim Bob Brown exited the band in 2019."

Following the release of the Birthday Club's debut EP, ""Lighten Up,"" Wells and his touring band embarked on several national tours, including appearances at major festivals like SXSW Official, In-Bloom & Savannah Stopover. The buzz generated by these early efforts caught the attention of NPR's Arts & Letters Radio, which then commissioned Stephen for the creation of two original scoring productions. These musical productions would serve as the catalyst for the writing and recording process of Birthday Club's recently released debut album, ""Obscure Emotion.""

Though the band has taken many shapes and forms since their inception in 2006, founder T. Elder has been consistently at the helm, producing music that’s as varied and insightful as his own inner workings.

Aitch’s inaugural release in 2007, ¡Aitch Y Double Hockey Sticks!, saw success in their then current music scene of Santa Rosa, CA. However, with his first son born in 2009 and another in 2011, T. Elder put the band on the backburner to attend to fatherhood duties.

Never letting his judicious mind rest, two solo albums made their way from T. Elder’s mind through his pen and collection of rare melodic mechanisms into a set of lo-fi recordings that channel the emotions of fatherhood and coming of age.

Both (ampersand) and The Lie You Leave, released in 2011 and 2012 respectively, were Aitch’s last blips on the map while T. Elder’s sons became older. Now at ages where they can join their father on his recordings, Aitch is back in the studio and creating a sound that’s yet again different from previous tracks.

From home recordings in closets to productions in professional grade studios, Aitch produces memorable and catchy music that might cause you to pull out a dictionary in order to fully grasp their lyrical depth."

Their lyrics and intent interweave with Gaia-mind emanations and inner/outer personal and collective freedom seeking.

The four-piece began releasing albums as a folk-duo with 2008’s And All I’ve Done Is Walk Around And Hide In Leaves and 2009’s Stillness Singing.  Layers of woodsy, wintery tones and hushed vocal harmonies were all blanketed in an analogue, lo-fi esthetic.  Lyrically the album mirrored Tyler's travels throughout Peru, winter-still sorrow, and inner journeys of meditation and sacred plant explorations.

Their sounds evolved from the snowy layering of their earlier material to an earthy, psychedelic realm.  In 2011 they released High Peak Hearth Songs, an E.P. chronicling a revelatory time Tyler spent travelling alone in the Andean high mountains. Their expanding sound wove influence from roots Americana, protest folk, tropicalismo and reggae, and in 2015 they released their third album, Earth Wave Sway on vinyl.  During production the band moved out to a small rural community in southwest Michigan to live in a travel trailer on a friend's organic farm.  Through quiet challenges of self-sufficiency and rambling moonlit ecstasies, country life profoundly impacted CMC’s creation-journey by connecting their inner spirit realms with the surrounding community of beings - animal, vegetable, mineral."
4299596,0,15190548,US,Parsonsfield,Happy Hour On The Floor,2020,40.17,10,"['LP', 'Limited Edition']","['Rock', 'Folk, World, & Country']","['Bluegrass', 'Folk', 'Folk Rock', 'Indie Rock']","Six years after coming together as a band of high-energy musical misfits—too rock for folk, too folk for punk, too punk for bluegrass—Parsonsfield found themselves standing at a crossroads. The critically acclaimed five-piece was down to just four members, and while the obvious solution may have been to simply replace their departed comrade, the group instead made the bold choice to completely reimagine their lineup and their catalog, carrying forward as a quartet with an ambitious new approach to writing and recording. The result was a genuine sonic rebirth, a wild musical awakening that brought Parsonsfield closer together than ever before and yielded their most exhilarating and adventurous record yet: Happy Hour On The Floor.

“Recording this album marked our first time working in the studio as a four-piece, and it was really liberating,” says lead vocalist Chris Freeman. “Once the lineup changed, we realized that there weren’t any restrictions on what we could do. It came with this boundless sense of musical freedom where anything felt possible.”

Produced by Benjamin Lazar Davis (Joan As Police Woman, Okkervil River), Happy Hour On The Floor fuses Parsonsfield’s rustic instrumentation and timeless sense of songcraft with dreamy synthesizers and vintage drum machines. The arrangements here are broad and spacious, often built off spare, hypnotizing loops that fuel the songs’ mesmerizing drive, and the band’s performances are deliberate and economical to match, substituting lean, careful construction in place of the strummed exuberance that defined much of their early work. The result is a record all about finding happiness in simplicity, a captivating collection more reminiscent of modern indie pop than old-school string bands that pushes the group far beyond the perceived boundaries of its sound even as it shines a spotlight on the heart and soul of what’s always made them such a joyous revelation.

Hailed by Folk Alley as ""the most jubilant and danceable indie roots music this side of the Carolinas,"" Parsonsfield—Freeman, mandolinist Antonio Alcorn, guitarist Max Shakun, and drummer Erik Hischmann—first emerged in 2014 with Poor Old Shine, an ecstatic acoustic collection that prompted The New York Times to praise them as ""boisterously youthful yet deftly sentimental” and No Depression to rave that they'll ""give you rich five-part harmonies one minute [and] sound like bluegrass on steroids the next."" The band grew more experimental on their 2016 follow-up, Blooming Through The Black, and the collection earned them both glowing reviews and dates with everyone from Josh Ritter and The Jayhawks to Mandolin Orange and The New Pornographers. That same year, the group saw their music featured in the hit AMC series “The Walking Dead” and teamed up with the prestigious FreshGrass Festival to compose a score for the 1922 silent classic Nanook of the North, which they performed live alongside the film at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.

In Japanese folklore, the crane wife is a bird disguised as a woman who spins fine silks from her own feathers, until her identity is discovered. The Crane Wives spin fine songs from whole cloth, and you will never want the melodies to leave your head. From murky origins in Chinese restaurants, high school ska bands, and dorm room jam sessions, the band came together in 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and immediately began gathering a following with intricate melodies, sister-harmonies, and compelling songcraft.  Initially part of the indie folk boom, their sound has grown and broadened with each new recording till categorization becomes difficult:  rock, pop, folk?  Just call it really good music.  "

Atlanta-based post-hardcore/alternative metal act the Chariot is a showcase for singer Josh Scogin. Formerly frontman for the popular Christian nu-metallers Norma Jean (originally known as Luti-Kriss, before Dirty South rapper Ludacris eclipsed their limited popularity), Scogin left Norma Jean for undisclosed personal reasons in 2003, following the release of their second album. Largely dispensing with the rap-rock and nu-metal aspects of Norma Jean in favor of a punkier metalcore direction, Scogin almost immediately formed the Chariot with members of other area metal and CCM groups.

The original lineup of the Chariot consisted of Scogin, singer and guitarist Keller Harbin, guitarist Tony Medina, bassist Joshua Beiser, and drummer Jeff Carter. Signing to the popular Christian indie rock label Solid State Records in 2004, the band debuted later that year with the almost operatically titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding. Following the subsequent release of a live DVD, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chariot, Medina and Carter left the band; new drummer Mark Nicks debuted on the 2005 EP Unsung, but was replaced by Jake Ryan before sessions began for the band's second full-length, The Fiancee. After the album was recorded, Beiser and Harbin left the Chariot (Harbin joining Every Time I Die) and were replaced by Jon Terry and Dan Eaton in time for an extensive North American package tour with other bands from the Solid State Records roster.

Delayed by the rapid changeover in band personnel, The Fiancee eventually surfaced in early April 2007 with new bassist Jon ""KC Wolf"" Kindler on board. Terry and Eaton's time in the band would be short-lived, with the pair being replaced by Bryan Russell Taylor and Stephen Harrison before the release of the band's 2010 album, Long Live. Taylor would be the next casualty of the Chariot's revolving-door lineup, with replacement Brandon Henderson coming on board in 2011. Further lineup changes found Kindler leaving the band to attend college with Henderson and Harrison taking over bass duties in the studio. The Chariot's fifth album, One Wing, featuring production from the band's longtime engineer/producer Matt Gordon, arrived in 2012"

His best known composition is ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" for the movie ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Various-Arthur-The-Album/master/157691]Arthur[/url]"" starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli. 
The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1981 (shared award with Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen).

Cross played with an Austin group called Flash before signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records, thanks to which he released his debut album, ""Christopher Cross"" in 1979 for which he won 5 Grammy awards. He received in the same gala the 4 main prizes that are: best recording, best song, best album and best new artist. Of this album they emphasize the songs ""Sailing"", ""Ride Like the Wind"" and ""Never Be the Same"".

His second album, [i]Another Page[/i] released in 1983 included the songs, ""Think of Laura"" and ""All Right"".

The song ""Think Of Laura"" has nothing to do with the characters Luke and Laura from the soap opera [i]General Hospital[/i]. He allowed ABC to use the song in this context; however, he has stated that he wrote ""Think of Laura"" not in reference to the television characters, but to celebrate the life of Denison University college student Laura Carter who was killed when she was struck by a stray bullet.

Cross contributed voices in the 1985 David Lee Roth song called ""California Girls"" and also voiced Alan Parsons' song ""So Far Away"" and has once come up with him on stage to play it.

The song ""Loving Strangers (David's theme)"" is part of the soundtrack of the movie [url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Various-Nothing-In-Common-Original-Soundtrack/master/415115][i]Nothing In Common[/i][/url] from 1986, with Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason.

His daughter Madison Cross is a singer and actress.

The oldest son of Peter Griffin in the series [i]Family Guy[/i] is named Christopher Cross Griffin.

Since 1981, Christopher held the record of being the only artist to win the so-called ""Big Four"" of the Grammy Awards in a single ceremony: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist.  Billie Eilish achieved the same feat in 2020 becoming the second person, the youngest person, and the first woman to do so."

153073,188161,1965407,US,Kiss,Sonic Boom,2009,130.93,30,['Album'],['Rock'],"['Hard Rock', 'Glam', 'Heavy Metal']","KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

Since 2018 there have been two versions of the band, one with classic members [a=Tracii Guns] and [a=Phil Lewis] and one with classic members [a=Steve Riley] and [a=Kelly Nickels]. In 2021, the incarnation with Riley and Nickels finally changed its name to [a=Riley's L.A. Guns] because of a lawsuit concerning the use of the band name.

L.A. Guns is an American rock band whose music is frequently associated with the L.A. glam metal scene which grew up around the Sunset Strip in the 1980s, in particular the sleaze rock subgenre. Guns N' Roses, which once featured three of the original L.A. Guns members, was the most prominent exponent of this subgenre, generally preferring an anti-social image to elaborate make-up and costumes. 

L.A. Guns was formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner.  Over the next couple years it would evolve into what became the original version of [a=Guns n' Roses].  Tracii Guns would depart that band in 1985 and launch a new version of L.A. Guns.  Throughout the years, a large number of musicians would pass through some version of the band (of which, at times, there have been two) and no single member would be consistently present at all times.  The band's longest-serving and best-known members are Tracii Guns, drummer Steve Riley (who joined the band in 1987 and is the closest thing to a constant member, having been in the band from 1987 until 1992, and again from 1994 until 2016), and vocalist Phil Lewis.  The L.A. Guns name is owned by both Tracii Guns and Steve Riley and both musicians have led their own versions of the band. Riley and Lewis led L.A. Guns from 1999 until 2016 while Guns had a second version of the band from 2006 to 2012.  In 2016, Lewis and Guns formed a new version of the band, while in 2018 Riley announced he had his own version which included one-time bassist Kelly Nickels.  In 2020, Lewis and Guns filed a lawsuit against Riley over the trademark to the L.A. Guns name after which a settlement was reached in which Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis would retained ownership of the L.A. Guns name while Steve Riley would use the name ""Riley's L.A. Guns"".

The name Blue Öyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA [a=Les Vegas (3)]) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer [a=Sandy Pearlman].  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.  

All the members contributed to the songwriting but lyrics were often provided by people outside of the group, including Sandy Pearlman, rock scribe [A=Richard Meltzer], poets [a=Patti Smith] (Lanier's longtime companion) and [a=Jim Carroll], and science fiction author [a=Michael Moorcock], amongst others.  Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"". The Bouchard brothers also contributed lead vocals.  

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.  Lanier returned in 1987 and the band continued to tour, although they recorded very little.  2001's ""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"" was the band's last studio recording until 2020's ""The Symbol Remains.""  Roeser and Bloom continue to tour with new members (Lanier retired from the band in 2006 and passed away in 2013) .

Full of spit and swagger -- and a ""dirty"" sense of humor to boot -- Jackyl quickly earned a deal with Geffen Records. Jackyl's live shows were already legendary before the ink dried on the Geffen contract.
The 1992 self-titled debut album went platinum and featured notable rock radio hits like ""Down On Me,"" ""When Will It Rain,"" ""I Stand Alone"" and, most notably, ""The Lumberjack,"" during which vocalist Jesse James Dupree performed a chain-saw solo. Dupree's chain-saw escapades on album and in concert became one of many Jackyl trademarks. With the release of 'Jackyl' hit the road and barely left it since. Just long enough to record new albums.
The band earned two Guinness Book of World Records citations and the designation ""The Hardest Working Band in Rock 'N' Roll"" for performing 100 shows in 50 days as well as 21 shows in 24 hours. Dupree says the most grueling of the two was 21 shows in 24 hours; Jackyl completed that task in Texas, and the shows were all done with full lights and sound. The daytime sets were 45 minutes long whereas the ones done at nighttime were between 90 and 120 minutes long. "

Comrades of Moby Grape (who even let Boogie use their rehearsal space) and the Sons Of Champlin, they played at all the legendary venues (The Ark, Avalon, Fillmore…) sharing stage with bands like Buffalo Springfield, Quicksilver, Ace Of Cups, Flamin’ Groovies or Country Joe & The Fish. Their explosive show at the Sky River Rock Festival (August, 1968, the first outdoor multi-band Rock Festival held in the United States) to an audience of 150,000 people, is still remembered today.

Sadly, their convulsed story, which includes undercover narks and marijuana busts, left them with no record deal.

They released two albums from 1993-1995. 
The band name is an abbreviation of Racial Holy War, which stems from a slogan of the World Church of the Creator/The Creativity Movement, of whom Burdi and the band belonged to. 
Many of the songs on their first album, which had a straight Oi!/Hardcore sound, had explicitly racist and violent lyrics, but they adopted a more mature style of songwriting to go with the gothic sound on their second album.

They broke up in 1997 after George Burdi renounced Racialism and formed a new band called Novacosm. Burdi would return to Racialism in later years.

In 2017, an album of demo recordings from the RAHOWA-Novacosm transitional era called ""Uberfolk"" was released, which was not authorised by Burdi. This was instead the name of his new band, which released its debut album ""Music for Nations"" in 2019, featuring versions of some of the tracks on the Uberfolk bootleg album.

In 1995, RAHOWA contributed their cover of Skrewdriver's ""The Snow Fell"" to the Foundations Forum's official sampler for that year's forum and to a Milwaukee-based Metal compilation. These are the group's only appearances on mainstream (non-WN) releases."

Formed in late 1992, this power trio with lead singer [a1593631] provides straight ahead, no-nonsense rock.

MaryAnn Scandiffio, whose voice is probably one of the best-kept secrets in American hard rock, is a well-established artist in Europe. 

In the early, to mid-1980s she fronted the New York heavy metal outfit known as [a660658], a band which she also founded. After signing with the Belgium label Mausoleum Records, Blacklace would produce two albums followed by videos and live performances in Europe including headlining Belgium's biggest hard rock festival at the time. Back in the States, the band became the opening act for; Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, The Plasmatics, Billy Sheehan, Joe Perry Project, Zebra and Humble Pie, among other national acts.

Scandiffio found her band rising in hard rock charts, with record sales in the tens of thousands. Though the growing success of Blacklace, Scandiffio had become a star in her own right, drawing large crowds at record signings and personal appearances and even being featured on the cover of Hit Parader magazine.

After Blacklace had decided to call it a day, Scandiffio began to focus on her next project. It was while working on her solo material with ex-KISS guitarist Ace Frehley, drummer Jamie Oldaker (Eric Clapton, Peter Frampton, Frehley’s Comet) and bassist Mark Clark (Coliseum, Uriah Heep, Billy Squire), when she would meet her NO ANGELS co-founder Robbie Parker. Scandiffio and Parker would soon begin working together and developing their unique sound and songwriting style.

Previously, Parker had performed up and down the eastern seaboard with his band Royal Tease. His signature guitar work had already been featured on national commercials for Chrysler. Other projects included producing with accredited producer/engineer Paul Orofino; a children’s album and an up and coming hip-hop artist. Most recently Parker wrote and produced the theme for a national television pilot with Blue Oyster Cult founding member Joe Bouchard. Parker would also play the guitar on all three projects.

Completing the musical equation are seasoned performers Scott Cable, who is well-established as one of the finest bass players on the Northeast club circuit, and drummer Kenny Siena, who has made his mark performing and recording extensively throughout the tri-state area with the band Realm. With Cable’s driving bass and Siena’s sledgehammer style of drumming together, they created a rhythm sound that is unmistakably NO ANGELS.

Whether tearing up a live performance or burning up a tape, NO ANGELS is undeniably back to the wall rock n’ roll. "

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band's bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record ""Hit The Lights"" for subsequent re-pressings of ""Metal Massacre"" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].

Metallica's debut LP, ""Kill 'Em All"", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by ""Ride The Lightning"".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released ""Master Of Puppets"", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's ""Garage Days Re-Revisited"", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length ""...And Justice For All"" followed in 1988, featuring the track ""One"" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.

In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as ""The Black Album"", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album ""Load"".  The following year, ""Reload"" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called ""S&M"", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called ""St. Anger"", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, ""St. Anger"" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.

In 2008, ""Death Magnetic"", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.

The following year, Jari Mäenpää joined as a vocalist (and second guitarist) and the first self-titled demo was released. 

Before releasing their second demo tape in 1999, Jukka-Pekka Miettinen replaced Sauli Savolainen on bass and ex-Arthemesia drummer Oliver Fokin swapped positions with Kimmo Miettinen. The band continued playing and recorded a third demo, ""Hero in a Dream"", which was noticed by underground (and non) magazines which allowed the band to gain popularity and sign a deal with Spinefarm Records. 

Finally, Meiju Enho joined as keyboard player for the band and they were now able to record their epic, self-titled debut ""Ensiferum"" in 2001.

A few years ago, a licensing company found and commissioned Ezra Bell to play and record Sam Cooke’s worst song for an insurance commercial. Said company flew Ben Wuamett (singer/songwriter) to Mexico City to record the vocals so as not to be sued by the Sam Cooke Foundation. The commercial aired on Superbowl Sunday. Ezra Bell espouses neither football nor insurance but sold out accordingly for the pittance that was paid, and the exposure. Such is the music industry. Many heartfelt messages from unknown listeners keep Ezra Bell busy writing and recording. At some point, a booking agency caught on to the growing cult following and propped Ezra Bell up in front of audiences outside of Portland, forcing the band to drive thousands of miles, sometimes in a single day, to play for small crowds. Ezra Bell recorded a new album over a year ago, and a record label recently decided to sign it, release it, even make vinyl copies. You’re reading this now because you’re about to encounter that album, suitably titled, This Way to Oblivion.

Although this project never really ended, I simply decided it was time to stop using the Romany Rye name and call this new body of work by its right name, Luke Scott MacMaster. The new album titled 310-602-7616 consists of Kelly Winrich of the Delta Spirit and myself while featuring a few friends like Matthew Followil of The Kings Of Leon, Blake Mills, Members of My Morning Jacket, Father John Misty and Danny Garcia aka Reverend Baron."""

Growing up in Mamaroneck, New York, high school memories are “driving to the Bronx at lunch time for bags of crappy pot sprayed with hairspray to make it seem more bud-like.” He left that all behind in order to study philosophy at Plymouth State College. Quitting after two years, he traveled around the U.S., hitting 42 of the 50 states. He moved into Portsmouth in 1987, resuming his studies at UNH while enjoying public transportation (though he had a car) as it “provided a lot of fodder for stories because freaky people take the bus,” and graduated with his philosophy degree in 1989.
Between 1988 and the birth of his record label Two Ton Santa, Guy was in the bands Fancy Pants, Toast, Size of Guam, The Driveways, Up-a-Tree, Beekeeper, The Pants, Bob & Guy, and The Crotch Wax Menace, “and probably some others I’m forgetting as well,” he guesses.
Sometimes, it was a one- or two-gig existence for the band, sometimes not. Sometimes, it was just a matter of trading musicians in and out of bands because everyone was connected to the same people and places. He played with the country band The Buckets, now based out of San Francisco, and comprised of Ray Halliday, Mary Lou Lord and Carrie Bradley. He headed up Two Ton Santa (the band, not the label), a two bass, drums and guitar ensemble with one singer. Guy’s band Milk of Magnesia, “a psychedelic band, almost,” opened their first show at The Rat with a faux imbibing of magnesia milk, inspiring audience members to volunteer their own drinking efforts, only they swallowed the real thing, which Guy seems to think they enjoyed quite a bit.

Nightwish was initially founded as an acoustic band with Holopainen on keyboards, Tarja Turunen on vocals and Erno ""Emppu"" Vuorinen on guitar, but turned into a heavy metal band in 1997 when drummer Jukka Nevalainen joined and they started to use electric guitar instead of acoustic one.

The group has gone through a few lead vocalist changes in their career. First with original member Tarja Turunen in 2005 and then with Anette Olzon in 2012 before settling on Floor Jansen in 2013.
Long time drummer Jukka Nevalainen was forced to quit the band for good in 2019 due to health issues (insomnia). Another key member, Marco Hietala quit due to personal issues in 2021.

Finntroll was established in 1997 by Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta (guitar) and Jan ""Katla"" Jämsen (vocals) who had the vision of fusing the darkness and grandeur of black metal with the traditional Finnish hoedown-music. Group's original line-up was completed in 1998 by Skrymer, Tundra, Trollhorn and Beast Dominator and their debut album ""Midnattens widunder"" was released in 1999. Altogether they have released six full lengths, the last one being 2013's ""Blodsvept"".

Despite being a Finnish band, Finntroll chose to write their lyrics in Swedish due to their original vocalist Katla being Fenno-Swedish.

In March 2003 Finntroll was struck by the tragic death of the guitarist Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta.

Eastern Mountain Time is a Country, Americana band based out of Burlington, VT.
In August of 2016 Eastern Mountain Time went into the barn/studio to start working on the songs for their follow up to 2015’s self-titled album, Eastern Mountain Time (released on Portsmouth, New Hampshire’s burst & bloom records). The goal was to craft a song cycle that would serve as a nod to both golden country and northern New England’s green mountains. In the year leading up to these sessions Sean Hood (guitar & vocals), Danny LeFrancois (drums & vocals), and Jason Pappas (bass) played countless - eh, you could probably count ‘em - Eastern Mountain Time shows throughout Vermont and the northeast, crafting and living inside of the songs that would come to make up the bulk of Mountain Country. In order to make a real-deal country album, the band enlisted Paper Castles’ Brennan Mangan to play pedal steel guitar, piano, and organ. It immediately became clear during recording that Mangan’s vision and skill would pair beautifully with the band’s musical sensibilities and he has since become a steady member of the EMT live band.
Mountain Country was self-released digitally and on vinyl on November 10th 2017.
In a review published in advance of the release, Seven Days’ Dan Bolles praised the record, writing “This is shuffling, 1970s-style country music as much by way or urban poet Charles Bukowski as Gram Parsons. As a result, the album has an edge that saves it from sad-sack navel-gazing” and “Altogether, Mountain Country could serve as either the soundtrack to wasted nights or the odd clarity of the hangover that sometimes follows them.”

Parent's frequent and impassioned performances at venues like Thalia Hall, Lincoln Hall, The Hideout, and The Empty Bottle made them an essential part of the local music community. 

In September of 2017, Gruber tragically died after a years-long battle with alcohol and heroin addiction. He was 26. His passing rocked the tightly-knit Chicago music community and the tragedy of losing his undeniable talent was bolstered by the absence of his generosity, empathy, and gentleness to his friends and family. Though Parent had only released one song publicly, the tender and unflinchingly honest “I Tried,” Gruber left a wealth of recordings and unfinished songs recovered by his family and friends. "

Coming of age in the 60s was a lucky break. It was a turbulent time that was transformational not only to my world view but also in lifting the gates on the limitations and fears on which many of us were raised.
For me, the music of the time was the doorway to my liberation. It began with access to R&B, the Motown explosion, and then the Folk world which was expressed in the voices of Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, Lightening Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, Jack Elliott, Phil Ochs, Tom Rush, Joan Baez. The marriage of Country to Blues to Folk and ultimately Rock and the ""British Invasion"" made those who tried to define popular music by segment seem out of touch.

IOWA CITY SONGWRITER
It’s been a rough year for Brian Johannesen. The same week he closed on his first house in Iowa City, IA, his mother-in-law went onto life support. Although she pulled through, her health steadily declined over the following months, leading to endless doctors appointments, hospital stays, rehab stints, and several months living with Brian and his wife. All the while Brian was trying to finish his second full-length solo release, “Holster Your Silver” (Due out Jan 31, 2020). Last April, she passed away in that new home.
While some of the songs on “Holster Your Silver” were written before any of this happened, they took on new meaning as he watched a loved one wither. The album inherited a haunting tone, dealing with personal issues like anxiety, loss, and a struggle to come to terms with an increasingly unjust political climate. These themes manifested themselves in an honest, lyric-forward collection of songs that offer a glimpse into the mind of a songwriter coming to grips with the real world.
A Chicago native and longtime Iowan, Johannesen’s Americana sound has always been firmly rooted in the Midwest. Drawing inspiration from his heroes like John Prine, Guy Clark, and Bruce Springsteen, he writes about everyday life with sincerity and often a little bit of his tongue in his cheek. Johannesen’s songs also carry a twang he learned from four years spent in Nashville, where he formally studied Music Business and informally studied the songwriters and musicians who inhabit Music City. He returned to Iowa City in 2016 where he felt more at home and free to pursue music without the industry looming over his head.
Songwriting has always been Johannesen’s passion, but for the past 6 years the music industry has also been his day job. He has worked as a talent buyer for clubs and festivals across the country over the years, and this experience has helped him understand the real struggle of musicians and promoters alike. This struggle also presents itself in his music as he reconciles the new and old models of “making it” in the business.
With “Holster Your Silver,” Johannesen takes a step forward, leaning into a craft he has worked at for over a decade. The result is a songwriter finding his own voice that is powerful, delicate, artful and accessible all at the same time.
Through the years, Johannesen has had the honor of sharing the stage with Shovels & Rope, Justin Townes Earle, Joe Pug, Greg Brown, The Felice Brothers, JD McPherson, Other Lives, S. Carey, The Cave Singers, William Elliott Whitmore, Langhorne Slim, Lydia Loveless, Junior Brown, Cory Branan, Paul Thorn, Willy Tea Taylor, Charlie Parr, David Dondero, and many more.

Ohio’s misfit son exposed to harsher California desert landscapes delivers on the long lost love letters you waited for at the mailbox all of those years.  Hoping for a promise of return, you receive word of yet another lonely voyage.  Are you remembered?

Isolation waters the fertile land stretching out in all directions.  LaValley’s unapologetic crooning calls the banshees back from the frozen wilderness and welcomes them into his modest desert cabin.

A small crew of creative visitors contribute to LaValley’s debut full length, From LaValley Below.  Harmonica, lap-steel, and female vocals move around acoustic guitar, all the while the crestfallen and introspective lyrics roll downstream like gravel under water, catching the light and sweeping the riverbank grasses along with it.  A kindred spirit with contemporary songwriters like Ryley Walker, LaValley also conjures images of a gothic Gene Clark collaborating with a desert-dwelling Bonnie “Prince” Billy---with the blessing of Townes Van Zandt.

LaValley’s songs are infused with communalism and camaraderie.  However, the album’s creation was not without incident.  One day while recording, an unknown neighbor of LaValley’s in the Joshua Tree desert---apparently unnerved by the recording session going on up the hill from their fortified desert home---fired multiple rifle shots into the cabin where LaValley and company were working.  Thankfully no one was injured by the potent incursion, but perhaps the incident cast a shadow on the album’s recording.  Ultimately, From LaValley Below proves that beauty is bulletproof.  We believe that Grant Earl LaValley’s debut full-length illustrates this maxim both literally and figuratively. "

For over 20 years he has been a staple of the New Orleans music scene, and his work has been described as ""the personification of the New Orleans ethos."" 

Before becoming a “solo” artist, he was the bass player/lead singer/founder of the funk band Juice. From the mid/late ’90s until the late ’00s, Juice released 3 albums and as contemporaries of Galactic, Iris May Tango and All That, part of the resurgence of New Orleans funk music. From 1999-2003, they toured relentlessly, averaging over 180 dates annually. They were recipients of 2000’s Best of the Beat Awards for Best Emerging Funk/Soul/R&B Band and later nominated for Best Roots Rock Band and Album.

He has recorded or performed with a host of New Orleans luminaries, including Art and Cyril Neville, Anders Osborne, George Porter, Joe Krown, Johnny Vidacovich and countless more.

His 2010 solo debut release, These Old Boots, co-produced by Grammy-winning songwriter/producer Anders Osborne, was named a Top 10 record of the year by the Times-Picayune.  His 2013 follow up, Bring Back Red Raspberry was compared to everything from the Rolling Stones' Exile On Main Street to Tom Petty to John Prine. Hittin' The Note magazine called it ""a polished, hook-heavy gem.""

After the release of BBRR, Jordan returned to nationwide touring, focusing mostly on the Gulf Coast down to Key West and extended tours in Colorado. Described as ""Southern roots rock with a Louisiana soul,"" his band, dubbed the Neighborhood Improvement Association, is a rotating cast of some of the finest, most in-demand roots rock, funk and blues musicians in New Orleans. 

In 2017, the band was nominated in OffBeat Magazine’s Best of the Beat Awards for Best Roots Rock Band and Album for their 2016 release, No Losers Tonight. Produced by Jeff Watkins (James Brown, Joss Stone, New Orleans Suspects), it features 10 originals, honed and crafted from the band’s 4 years of touring. 
He has been featured in numerous local, regional and national publications including Relix, offBeat, Times-Picayune, Gambit, Hittin' The Note, An Honest Tune; as well as NPR, Raw Travel and every local television station. He is also featured - along with Tab Benoit, Dr. John, Aaron Neville and more - in the Voice of the Wetlands television commercial, promoting the awareness and education of rebuilding the LA Gulf coast. 2019 also marks his 11th consecutive appearance at the Voice of the Wetlands Festival.

Along with his involvement with VOW, Dave is active in various organizations in the New Orleans community, including multiple events with the Team Gleason Foundation and 4 years as a featured guest teacher with Upturn Arts summer art program. Most notably though, is his work with the New Orleans Musicians Clinic. Besides being featured in their print ad campaign, Dave is the producer of Jamie’s BigAss Party, an annual event honoring the legacy and memory of his former bandmate and friend, Jamie Galloway. Now in its 7th year, the block party/crawfish boil, held at the Maple Leaf Bar, has raised over $100,000 for mental health services provided by NOMC. In 2019, he was honored to perform two shows at the historic 50th New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and regularly gigs at legendary New Orleans venues The Maple Leaf Bar and Tipitina’s.

It has always been her big dream to perform with a women’s heavy metal band on stage. During the music university studies she already started her first group: ATLAS & AXIS with which she has already recorded two albums and played several concerts!
In 2015 Romana started to look for talented ladies for the new combo. Jeanine Grob (bass) a longtime friend, became the first official member. At a party on a festival Romana met Seraina Telli (singer) for the first time. It clicked right away betweens the two girls, on a musical and on a personal level. Seraina brought in many ideas and a lot of experience cause of her studies at the Music Academy and her band SURRILIUM. The guitarist and the singer became a great songwriting team right away!
Romana wrote her mate Schmier from DESTRUCTION / PANZER about her new project, he was interested in the new outfit and the ladies brought him onboard as a producer / consultant!
After an intensive search and different auditions, BURNING WITCHES found Lala Frischknecht the perfect drummer for the all chick metal band . Since summer 2015, the girls have been working hard on new material and in autumn 2015 they recorded the first three songs with VO Pulver at Little Creek Studio (PANZER / PRO PAIN / DESTRUCTION).

This project became a springboard, with a performance that followed at the Melodic Rock Festival.

The band recorded their first EP as ""Saint"" entitled ""Warriors of the Son"" in early 1984 on Rotten Records.

In 1986 Saint recorded their first full length Lp on Pure Metal records entitled ""Time's End"". It was a groundbreaking album for the band and got airplay on many christian radio stations throughout the US.

In 1988 the band released the album ""Too late for living"" which featured Dee Harrinton on guitar.It also was on the pure metal label and had a more produced and metal sound.

Not long afterward the band broke up and the record company folded and many Saint fans were left wondering why.

In 1997 Richard and DeAnna Lynch reissued all three Saint albums on a two CD set. Then in 1999 Saint released a full length entitled ""The Perfect Life"" which was more of a modern sound with a couple of classic sounding Saint songs.Later that year and into the new millenium Saint would work along with M8 Distribution to re-issue ""Warriors of the Son"" with The Gentiles demo, Too Late for Living and ""Times End"" with a live show from Cornerstone 1986. Armor Records then picked up the band and re-released remastered versions of the band's first three CD's. Saint returned in Febuary 2004 after a long hiatus with another album, In The Battle.

David Ellefson is best known as the original bass player for Megadeth, a band he helped found with guitarist/frontman [a=Dave Mustaine] in 1983 following Mustaine's dismissal from [a=Metallica].  Ellefson, known as ""Junior"" within the band, remained the only player to perform with Mustaine and Megadeth throughout the band's initial run from 1983 through 2002.  When Mustaine resurrected the Megadeth name in 2004, Ellefson was not included.  An unsuccessful lawsuit brought by Ellefson against Mustaine over Megadeth rights and royalties only served to heighten tensions between the former band mates.  Although Mustaine would announce that the two had eventually settled their personal differences, he did not foresee Ellefson ever rejoining the band, and Megadeth released 3 studio albums with different bassists.  In the meantime, Ellefson performed with the groups F5 and Hail and went to work for Peavy Amplifiers.  

In February 2010, it was announced that Ellefson had rejoined Megadeth. He remained a member until May 24, 2021, when they split up with Ellefson again due to explicit videos of him that were posted online causing a scandal."

The band was formed by vocalist [a=King Diamond (2)] and guitarist [a=Hank Shermann] in 1981.  The original MF line-up shared members with another Copenhagen band, Danger Zone, whom Diamond and Shermann were helping out.  By 1982, the ""classic"" Mercyful Fate line up of Diamond, Shermann, guitarist Michael Denner (ex-Brats and Danger Zone), bassist Timi ""Grabber"" Hansen (Danger Zone), and drummer Kim Ruzz was in place. Over the next couple years, the band would release an EP and 2 LPs that would cement their reputation as one the most influential metal bands of the early 1980s.  King Diamond's blasphemous lyrics and theatrical stage presence would have many label the band as part of the 1st wave of black metal, although musically the band was closer to the style of Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  The group split in 1985, as Shermann decided he wanted to pursue a more commercial direction.  King Diamond launched a solo career, taking Denner and Hansen with him, while Kim Ruzz disappeared into the regular world.

The band's legend continued to grow after their split.  In 1993, the classic line up, minus Kim Ruzz, reformed for a new album, ""In The Shadows"".  Hansen dropped out after that release but the group continued on throughout the 1990s.  At the same time, King Diamond kept his own solo career going.  Michael Denner left the band after 1996's ""Into The Unknown"" and Diamond and Sherman continued on with new players.  1999's ""9"" is, to date, the band's last full-length release.  King Diamond has stated that MF has not split up but the band is on hold for the foreseeable future.  In 2009, Diamond, Shermann, Denner, Hansen, and drummer Bjarne Holm (who has played with the group since 1994) reunited to re-record the songs ""Evil"" and ""Curse Of The Pharoah"" for the ""Guitar Hero:  Metallica"" video game.

In 2019, the group announced they would be playing a series of live dates.  The line up would include Diamond, Sherman, Wead, Holm, and bassist Joey Vera (filling in for Timi Hansen, who was battling cancer). Timi Hansen lost his battle with cancer on November 4th, 2019.

Originally from Argentina and Chile, the twosome brought on fellow Atlantans Adam Mitchell (guitar) and Jason Belisha (drums). But Irist wouldn’t become Irist until vocalist Rodrigo Carvalho (vocals), a Brazilian, joined the fold. It was then, after measured improvement as songwriters and an extended courtship with renowned A&R man Monte Conner, that Irist inked the Nuclear Blast deal and the rest is history.

While there are vestiges of the group’s pan-South American heritage (from Andean music to heroes Sepultura) throughout Order of the Mind, the band’s collective influences come from all parts of the heavy spectrum. From The Melvins, Ratos de Porão, and Alice in Chains to The Dillinger Escape Plan, Soundgarden, and Converge, Irist fold in, twist fervently, and scorch their faves until they’re decidedly protean and uniquely a product of the fivesome’s songwriting prowess. Irist have an uncanny ability to write songs—massive songs—that are absurdly memorable and super-charged. At once a representative of contemporary anxiety and old-fashioned aggression, Order of the Mind is hewn from the very same things that made Sepultura’s Chaos A.D., Machine Head’s Burn My Eyes, Mastodon’s Crack the Skye, and Gojira’s The Way of All Flesh so timeless and irrepressibly great. In short, Irist’s debut, Order of the Mind, is a must-hear. "

Comprised of three members — Kirk Witt on guitars and vocals, Matt Vallarino on drums, and Keegan Ferrari on bass — the group crafts massive and immersive soundscapes juxtaposed over catchy, pop-like song structures. It is this penchant for blending familiar sounds and styles into something altogether new that has allowed the band to undergo a dramatic metamorphosis from their humble beginnings improvising in a shed outside of Reno, Nevada, to preparing for the debut of their second full-length album, “Planet Silver Screen,” on Prosthetic Records.
 
Reactions to the group have consistently exhibited an air of positivity and excitement from its very inception. The band’s introductory self-titled EP was released in January of 2014, catching the eye of internet-metal extraordinaire Ben Sharp, aka Cloudkicker. As interest began to grow for a follow-up release, those in Four Stroke Baron began to realize their potential and take matters more seriously. Their next endeavor, a full-length titled “King Radio,” was released in the winter of 2015 to substantially more fanfare and acclaim. Sputnik Music claimed in an album review, “Simply put, Four Stroke Baron is a band that defies categorization. Their choruses are simultaneously abrasive and soothing, the riffs recall both Mastodon and Rush…,” and, “Four Stroke Baron is weird, and fun, and bizarre, and hooky, and crazy, and they will be on repeat for a very long time.” It was this album that later caught the attention of Prosthetic Records, who swiftly offered an opportunity to join their prestigious roster. 
 
With such a wealth of motivation and encouragement fueling the band, Four Stroke Baron set out to produce their biggest and most ambitious record yet for their label debut. Recorded over the majority of 2017, “Planet Silver Screen” is an amalgamation of all the band has come to represent musically thus far, while also pushing themselves into previously uncharted sonic territories. From having their hardest-hitting riffs to date, featuring a guest saxophone solo by blackjazz rebel Jørgen Munkeby of Shining, to commissioning a full-blown stop motion animation music video for their debut single, Four Stroke Baron have truly arrived in full force and will make even the most diehard muso take note.

The band has gone through countless line-ups and many former members have gone on to become significant figures in a variety of musical scenes.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles. This line-up lasted until 2004, when Jesse Pintado left the band. Currently the band consists of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and Danny Herrera.

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums). This line-up went in the studio with [a=Ross The Boss] of [a=Manowar] producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"". Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin. Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello. Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived. Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist. From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record four LPs and two EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands. In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums. A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with [a=Public Enemy] on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  
The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna. He was replaced by John Bush of [a=Armored Saint]. The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"". The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release. The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and [a=Dimebag Darrell] of [a=Pantera]. In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"". The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras. After the recording, Frank Bello left the group. Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano. This line-up toured together until 2007. Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"". Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group. In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown. Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for two years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"". However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band. Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time. In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.
“Worship Music”, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year. At the start of 2013, Caggiano left the group."

Kindled by Matthew, Eric, and Ian, as a clatter of nonsensical riffs, the group commenced their crusade to infect the ears of the Twin Cities inhabitants. From one podium to another, the trio contaminated onlookers who foolishly stood before them, tainting and taunting their victims with what was next to come.

As the campaign sustained, a caroling Brad Grimm meanderingly floated before them, lute in hand, strumming and serenading verses of uncultured fables. Awestruck by such an unforgivable display and overjoyed with triumphant pleasure for this happenstance, Matthew, Eric, and Ian insisted that Brad join their quest. Many a beer later, Brad swore his bellowing voice to the ruination of virgin ears and mounted their expedition.

Fortnight after fortnight passed as the four sauntered the nearby taverns, luring prospective cohorts with extravagant tales of brawling matches for grails of honey, shadowy figures surfing the great lava waves of the hidden world, and the glorious misadventures that have left warriors howling and crumbling with burning urination. Unbeknownst to them, an onlooker had nestled into in these spectacles, leering with his three eyes for an opportunity board their undertaking.

Spotting his entrance, he enchanted Brad with his yearning to join repugnant beings and their deviance. With the strum of a chord, the band lustrously welcomed Tony without another breath. Now complete, with Matthew and Tony shrilling hooks on their guitars, Ian quaking the earth on the bass, Eric thundering and crashing rhythms behind the drums, and Brad roaring and gripping the audience with his poetries, the band has set their sights toward the next chapter in their crusade, the complete defilement of the world and its innocence.

As a child, he played piano, guitar and flute. He went to college in St. Louis where he discovered free jazz, before dropping out and moving to Manhattan. There he gave concerts in his small apartment, playing a variety of reeds, duck calls, tapes, etc; almost anything. In the mid 1980s he signed to the [l146599] label. Since then, he has released a very large number of records, usually putting out several each year.

Written by acclaimed new music composer and percussionist Will Mason during a state of extreme and protracted sleep deprivation, the music on their debut album Northfieldis an exploration and celebration of the altered states of consciousness that asceticism elicits. It is about experiencing exultation through absence. It is about ecstasy through privation. 

The suite of songs on Northfield bring to mind cutting-edge rock artists like Lightning Bolt, Tyondai Braxton, and Zs; contemporary concert music giants like Giacinto Scelsi, Gyorgi Ligeti, and Gérard Grisey; and even approximating the controlled musical chaos evident on Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band’s, Trout Mask Replica. The album threads together a series of short, visceral pieces, from the manic, off-center “Fork!” and the hocketing drum and guitar pairs of “Spoon!” to the pounding tom-tom march and spectral guitar chords of “Rupture!” The album culminates in the 13-minute epic “Rapture!”, which spirals a chain of short motives into their outer limits. 

Happy Place features Mason on drums, along with drummer Austin Vaughn (Here We Go Magic, Pavo Pavo) and guitarists Andrew Smiley (Little Women, Will Mason Ensemble) and Will Chapin (Empyrean Atlas). The band has gained renown for their powerful live performances. The music is physically intense to play, even painful at times, not to mention mentally taxing. It is performed ritualistically, at high volume and with high intensity, without interruption. Reviewing one of the band’s live performances, music blog ThrdCoast wrote: “Happy Place create an oppressive yet thrilling work that lures the listener into a seven-minute trance, not loosening its grip until the very last dissonant guitar note and meticulous cymbal crash fade.”

Mason’s debut album as a bandleader, Beams of the Huge Night (New Amsterdam Records), was released to critical acclaim:Avant Music News named it Album of the Year, and PopMatters premiered the track “Finn,” calling it “extraordinary.” CriticAllan Kozinn wrote ""Mason’s music has an irresistible freshness and vitality that helps bring seemingly disparate elements together.”"

By the time Loveless was 13, she had taken up songwriting and was doing shows with local bands, playing a combination of rootsy country and punk-influenced rock & roll.

Inspired by legendary long-timers John Prine and Willie Nelson, Andy McAllister spent a good three years kicking the tires on new tunes, filling up notebooks and stockpiling stories. And after releasing three albums with his previous band Vanish Valley, he found himself drifting around Los Angeles - still dreaming of putting together a group that would reach for that laid-back California country sound that he originally left Seattle for in the first place.

He reconnected with guitar and genuine renaissance man, Henry Derek Elis, who he first met 10 years ago when he moved to LA. Elis brought equal parts Waylon Jennings and Crazy Horse into the equation and the band quickly took shape with Ryan Wykert (Ivory Deville) on drums and Ben Coil on bass.

In a matter of months, the group swiftly sorted through McAllister’s song sketches, giving thumbs up to what immediately felt good, bringing the vibes and breathing new life into them. The band went into the Heritage Recording Company with Chris Rondinella (who got his start engineering for Levon Helm) and in two days tracked 11 songs live.

Jon Niemann (Gospelbeach) and Frankie Palmer kindly added keys and pedal steel, respectively. The results are roll-your-window-down Americana mixed with a healthy dose of outlaw country goodness that might just hit the sweet spot on the ears just as the sun starts to set on the horizon."

His first solo album (The Man I Once Was) painted a portrait of a man in turmoil and his second (Dancers In The Mansion) took on a more celebratory tone.  His new release The Great Silence takes on the metaphysical realm exploring grand themes of life, death, and rebirth.  While it’s not technically a “concept” album, it feels like one with its repeating themes and motifs.

The album opens with instrumental track “The Renaissance” showing us right away Eastham is ready to break through the restrictions of the Americana genre where his previous work resided.  Synths play a prominent part on that track and the album as a whole.  Rather than keep his songwriting and film score composing separate, Eastham made the conscious decision to blend the two for this album creating a cinematic backdrop for his esoteric, yet relatable tales.

Using both analog and digital synths, Eastham created rich sonic soundscapes that weave through most of the songs.  Title track “The Great Silence” features a biting lead analog synth evocative of the classic Moog sound.  That song has a 9+ minute instrumental coda that closes out the album with a “John Carpenter meets Run The Jewels” vibe. In the somber “Do You Dream”, Eastham’s stark voice and acoustic guitar are wrapped in warm synth sounds highlighting a bass tone that gets deeper and deeper with each successive, heartbreaking verse.  

While Eastham has expanded his sonic palette, the rich storytelling of his lyrics remain intact.  The first single “40 Days” has a synthy rock n roll vibe and contains dark and surreal lyrics showcasing metaphysical elements found throughout the entire album.  According to Eastham:  “‘40 Days’ was one of the earliest songs I wrote on the album and, because of that, it helped define the overarching death/rebirth theme of the entire record. Through the main character’s exotic journey into the heart of darkness I was able to address some of my own fears regarding death and madness. During the recording process, this is the first song I put synths on. I really fell in love with that sound which also went on to help define the whole album.”

Songs “One More” and the anthemic “Take My Land” have a classic rock vibe with nods to the past but arrangements that reside firmly in the present. And lest you think Eastham has left the country genre behind, he brings his vocal chops to the country tune “Curtain Call” bringing to mind recent work by Chris Stapleton.  “Flowers To My Gravestone” somehow manages to mix disco and bluegrass in Eastham’s humorous tale of man stuck between this world and the next.

“The Executioner’s Lament” is reminiscent of Eastham’s work with Day Of The Outlaw that veered more towards hard rock. The surreal yet poignant lyrics match the visceral power of the music.  The spooky “Lake’s Edge” is evocative of a classic horror film with its mysterious tale of a man assessing his life while visiting his hometown.

While big drums have always been a trademark of Eastham’s sound, his hip-hop influences shine through even more on this record.  This is most evident on the searing “Beyond The Oaks” where Eastham sings over booming 808 drums.  He explains, “I really wanted to throw out the rulebook for this album.”  That adventurous spirit is also evident in the rocker “Life Of Crime” that features a synth solo with a distinctly Eastern European vibe.

This album marks Eastham’s second outing co-producing his own material alongside Burke Ericson.  Eastham now works out of his own studio and through his film score work has moved more comfortably into the producer role.  As he put it, “I really had a lot of fun collaborating with Burke on the album’s production. Burke is in LA and I’m in Nashville so we were constantly sending ideas and sounds back and forth. I think this album was our truest collaboration in terms of really dialing in a specific and unique sound for this record.” 

The bulk of the album was recorded at ER Studio in Nashville, TN.  Though there are synth sounds throughout, Eastham and Ericson wanted the album to have a live rock n roll feel at its core.  Thus all four band members recorded together in the same room so each song had a vibe unique to that moment.  The album features returning champions Allen Jones on drums and Jeff Rogers on lead guitar.  Christopher Griffiths joined the team on bass guitar.  All four of them have played live shows together, so there was already a strong musical bond in place before they set foot in the studio.

This time around Eastham and Ericson played most of the extra instrumentation themselves rather than reaching out to their friends as they did on Eastham’s previous albums.  They did bring back the outrageously talented David Yuter on piano/organ and Jennifer Gibbons returned laying down beautiful backing vocals throughout the record.  The album was once again mixed and mastered by the maestro Rich Mouser.
 
Eastham was born and raised in the foothills of rural Northern California. He grew up on the sounds of classic and outlaw country, supplemented with a love of rock ’n’ roll—starting with his parents’ beat-up Elvis and Beatles records on up through the glossy pop of hair metal. Eastham is also a long time hip-hop fan, with a strong appreciation for the classics as well as modern sounds.  A lot of his youth was spent consuming horror films which were also a big influence on this album.
 
While attending UC Davis, Eastham played drums in various bands. After graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering, he switched gears and moved to Los Angeles to attend film school and study acting. He fronted the band Day Of The Outlaw for two albums before embarking on a solo career after moving to Nashville from Los Angeles in the fall of 2010. He immediately fell in love with the city.  According to Eastham, “You just can’t help but be creative in this town”.

While continuing with his lyric based songwriting, Eastham has also moved further into the world of film scoring.  In 2020 he scored feature length horror film “Human No More”.  The soundtrack album is due to arrive on vinyl mid-2021.

The band comprising the bass-free duo of [a278763] [vocals, guitar, keyboards] and [a367269] [drums, percussion]. The Whites, once married and divorced in March 2000, formed their lo-fi garage band in 1997. They officially ceased to perform in Feb 2011.

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

Danzig morphed out of the goth punk band Samhain after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin. Rubin was interested in working with Glenn, but not with Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group. Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von and guitarist John Christ and for drums Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. The original line-up recorded band’s first four albums, but during the mid-90’s the group started to disintegrate with first Chuck Biscuits leaving the group and soon after John Christ and Eerie Von followed. At the time Glenn also came at odds with producer Rubin and his label and the two ended collaborations as well.

Following the line-up turmoil Glenn took distance from the blues driven heavy metal that Danzig had become known for and introduced strong industrial sound on “Danzig 5: Blackaciddevil”, a move that was not received well by fans or critics. After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band returned to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, but have not managed to recapture the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records had.

Current line up: 
Glenn Danzig - Vocals (1987– ) 
Tommy Victor - Guitar (1996–1997, 2002–2005, 2008–)

Founded in 1993 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the ""core"" of Zao.

Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. 
To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, three EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process.

He soon began his experiments with prepared guitar, applying objects including magnets, binder clips, chains, a violin bow and even toenail clippers to distort the instrument's sound; in time Drumm befriended a number of members of Chicago's growing improv community, including Jim O'Rourke (with whom he served in Brise-Glace, additionally contributing to Gastr del Sol's Upgrade and Afterlife album and Ken Vandermark. In late 1997 Drumm made his solo debut with a self-titled (Perdition Plastics) and has released superb duo records with Taku Sugimoto (Sonoris), Axel Dörner, Martin Tètreault (both Erstwhile) and Ralf Wehowsky (Selektion). 
His chameleon-like presence has been documented on a number of projects, each revealing new facets of his wide-ranging and unique talents on both guitar and electronics. Drumm seamlessly melds the worlds of acoustic and electronic sound, occasionally teetering on the edge of silence, yet always remaining impeccably musical.
Kevin Drumm has recorded and performed with Phill Niblock, Tony Conrad, Jim O'Rourke, MIMEO, Mats Gustafsson, John Butcher, Thomas Ankersmit, Taku Sugimoto and many others."

His interest in science led him to build his own effects boxes for the instrument. He became intrigued with all types of experimental music, from contemporary classical to free jazz and sophisticated rock. Sharp studied anthropology at Cornell University, where he played in a band and took an electronics class with synthesizer inventor [a=Robert Moog]. At Bard College he studied with free jazz pioneer [a=Roswell Rudd] (future Lounge Lizards John and [a=Evan Lurie] were classmates). He went to graduate school in Buffalo, where his academic advisor was [a=Morton Feldman]. He moved permanently to New York City in 1979, where he played gigs at various underground performance spaces, including the notorious ~Mudd Club. In the '80s Sharp became a major figure on the downtown New York experimental music scene, collaborating with many of its most prominent players, including [a=John Zorn], [a=Wayne Horvitz], [a=Bobby Previte], and [a=Butch Morris]. Over the years, Sharp has led his own bands more often than not. His music draws upon the wide range of his influences, from Coltrane to Zappa to Xenakis and beyond.

SPACE CAMP is a two piece experimental project from South Windsor, Connecticut. Once described as “non-denominational, non-binary hardcore,” SPACE CAMP is genreless but painfully sincere - they channel all of the trappings of hardcore, metal, and the avant-garde using keyboards, trombone, and a drum set. They write songs about survival, despair, gender dysphoria, gender euphoria, anger, and hope. The best way to understand it is to hear it.

Zion was born out of a desire on the part of the Godspeed players to work in a smaller musical ensemble; in effect, to escape some of the constraints that often accompany writing and arranging music democratically with nine musicians.  As well, Efrim simply wanted a vehicle to realize some of his own musical ideas that would not necessarily work well within the context of Godspeed. 

For the band's second and third records, the line-up expanded to six players, including [a367473], [a439157] and [a284430], and the band re-named as The Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra and Tra-la-la Band.  [a477462] joined the band for [m=8331], and now there were seven.

Echoing the varied Spanish landscapes captured in the film, the three emerged with a set of slow-motion psychedelic rock’n’roll songs (releasing them as Bad Rabbit). 
Following these scoring sessions Jim, Shane, and Carter continued to record new originals while also exploring the back-alleys of American country, noise, and psychedelia. Now having changed their name to SQÜRL the group has readied a series of EPs of these songs, recorded over a 3 year period by Shane at Treefort Recording in Brooklyn, NY. 
In 2013, SQÜRL collaborated with Jozef Van Wissem to score the film ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE. The film and soundtrack album were released worldwide in 2014. "

Growing up on the quieter streets of New Jersey, but with New York City just moments away, childhood friends Corey Mastrangelo (guitar), Grant Mayer (guitar/keys) and Derek Broomhead (drums) would spend their summer days running from punk shows to late night raves, living a dichotomous life that wormed its way into their music.
Forever too dancey for their post-rock peers, but too post-rock for their dance music friends, Vasudeva’s career to date has been spent on a tightrope, the tension between walking that fine line adding angst to their soaring tracks. On their new record, ​Generator​, however, things are different. There is a sense of peace and assuredness to the New Jersey trio - no longer three kids in their early-twenties trying to find their way, it feels like Vasudeva have finally found what they were searching for.
A seamless and soaring record, ​Generator​ sees Vasudeva truly completely comfortable in their own skin for what feels like the first time. Written, produced and engineered by the band over the course of three months in early spring with the help of their long-time friend Kevin Dye, it is an entirely personal, (almost) chronological time capsule of the band as they entered their late twenties; growing and evolving as people, their music following suit. There is a sense of a new beginning, a new chapter. Using Logic Pro X for the first time, Mastrangelo, Mayer and Broomhead were, for the first time, able to tap into their wide, varied set of influences; exploring textures, using midi and incorporating drum machines and synth sounds that they first fell in love with through their affinity for dance music.
Harnessing electronic drums and voice notes recorded by Mayer when commuting in New York City, using real keys and reel-to-reel tape machines, ​Generator​ masterfully blends the analog and the electronic. “Stockmar” sees Vasudeva at their most R'n'B inspired, the slowest track on the album showcasing their growth, yet named after Broomhead’s childhood street where the band spent endless amounts of time growing up. Things change, but they are always rooted in the past.
The record is undeniably textured, layers of instruments complementing each other - nylon strings piggybacking off piano chords in “Drop”, programmed bass sitting atop Broomhead’s ever fidgeting drums in “Yamaha”. Everything has its place, but nothing feels regimented. It’s a free-flowing feeling, a structured emotion.
There is an overwhelming emotional quality to the music Vasudeva creates, and in ​Generator​ this voice is at its strongest. While there are still the walls of sound that featured in previous works ​Life In Cycles​ and ​No Clearance​ (the ending of opener “Breaks” threatens to blow any speaker it is played through, and the breakdown in “III” provides one of ​Generators​ loudest moments), there is a much clearer focus on production, on texture, on feeling in this record. The SP-404 created “Only On” leaves you swirling and shifting as the EQ pans back and forth, creating a truly unique listening experience, transporting you underwater.
Obsessed with this level of production, ​Generator​ speaks to the notion of technology pushing Vasudeva forward in their everyday lives. Idle or not, we must push on. There is an overwhelming sense of calm to ​Generator,​ the landscape created by Mastrangelo, Mayer and Broomhead enveloping and swaddling the listener, the music ebbing and flowing, creating worlds while saying nothing at all."

Throughout their 40-year career they have had a rotating cast of more than 10 bass players and have released more than 20 studio albums. Their current bassist is [a492942]. They perform under the name ""Melvins Lite"" with Trevor Dunn on stand-up bass and under the name ""Melvins 1983"" with Dale on bass instead of drums, in reference to the early incarnation of the band circa 1983 before Dale played the drums in the band. The name Melvins came from a grocery clerk at the Thriftway in Montesano where King Buzzo served as clerk and vandal. Melvin was the most hated fellow employee and they felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.

The band was formed in 1993 by Dave Willey (formerly of Big Foot Torso) and Jon Stubbs. They were inspired by European artists outside the commercial mainstream, such as Nimal and Fem Soker En Skaat. Original members also included Deborah Perry (keyboards, vocals), Steve Doyle (guitar), Greg LaLiberte (saxes, flute), and Josh Wright (drums). Willey plays keyboards, guitar and melodeon; Stubbs handles bass, keyboards, trombone and miscellaneous other instruments.

The band's first album, Songs from the Hamster Theatre, was recorded on four-track cassette and released in 1995 on Prolific Records. Personnel changes abounded, and it was not until 1996 that the band recorded again. At this point, Willey and Stubbs were joined by Mark Harris (winds, reeds), Mike Johnson (guitar), Mike Fitzmaurice (bass), and Raoul Rossiter (drums). Harris and Johnson are also in Thinking Plague. An album called Siege on Hamburger City was recorded live at the Mercury Cafe in 1998.

While engaging a series of different bass players, the band has put out two more albums: Carnival Detournement (2000) and The Public Execution of Mr. Personality (2006), which is packaged with Quasi Day Room, a live document from a festival appearance in Seattle in 2002. These later albums appeared on Cuneiform Records.

On December 30th 2008, drummer Charlie Zeleny stated that after 5 years with the group, he was leaving to focus on his career as a studio musician.  In early 2009, Weasel Walter was announced Zeleny's replacement and the group headed in a more aggressive direction with their 2nd full-length ""Horrorscension"" released in 2012.

On January 27, 2015 the band announced that they had amicably parted ways with Weasel Walter and were searching for a new drummer. The band announced on July 12, 2016 that they had found their new drummer, Jason Bauers, and later that year released a new album ""Cognitive Emancipation"".

While [a=Doberman (7)] existed as an Indiana quartet rooted primarily in the industrial and experimental-electronic musical traditions, Crazy Doberman has gone on to incorporate elements of free jazz, found sound, musique concrète, and diverse instrumentation into their recordings and performances. 
The project originated as a series of collaborations with John Olson but has continued to include collaborations with various artists across a diverse musical spectrum. The live set generally consists of a rotating and revolving cast of core members alongside accompanying improvisors. These live sessions often function as source material for their recorded output, with most releases recorded and mixed by member Tim Gick.  "

Oranssi Pazuzu was formed in 2007 by [a2312967] (vocals, guitar), [a2312969] (drums), [a2312968] (bass guitar), [a2312970] (guitar) and [a2312966] (synthesizers, organ, effects). Oranssi (Orange) in the band's name refers to cosmic energy and the color of the first light rays in the Big Bang, while Pazuzu is a mythic demon of the wind, also appearing in the film The Exorcist.

During 2007-2008, Oranssi Pazuzu wrote songs using means of repetition and improvisation, fusing together various influences ranging from Black Metal to Space Rock. These early songs were recorded in Korjak's family cabin in the late summer of 2008 and released as the group's debut album Muukalainen puhuu by Violent Journey Records in April 2009.

In 2009-2010, Oranssi Pazuzu played shows around Finland and continued to write music that twisted itself towards darker and more aggressive moods. Sometime in early 2010, the band became friends with Marko Neuman (aka MN), a Finnish underground musician, who had an idea of a split album with Neuman's band Candy Cane. In September 2010, Oranssi Pazuzu played their first concerts outside Finland in Germany and the Netherlands. In November 2010, the Candy Cane / Oranssi Pazuzu split was released as a co-operation of two labels Firebox and Verdura Records.

Kosmonument, their second full-length album, was recorded in the old Karhu Manor in March 2011. MN acted as an artistic advisor, while Sami Jormanainen engineered the recordings and the mixing. The band described Kosmonument as a concept album that would summarize the musical ideas of cosmic darkness they had been developing ever since their debut album. In May 2011, Start Records released a vinyl version of Muukalainen puhuu and during the summer the band made a deal with Spinefarm Records regarding their future album. Kosmonument was released on 26th October 2011 as a CD by Spinefarm Records and as a double-lp by Blackspin Music.

In 2008, they released Gong Lake with avant arbiter Table of the Elements, home to art heroes Tony Conrad, Rhys Chatham and Faust. Following that, the band released two lps with the esteemed Northern Spy Records. Neptune has shared the stage with a variety of influential artists such as The Ex, Mission of Burma, Ut, Oneida, Lightning Bolt, The Flaming Lips, Blonde Redhead, Melt-Banana, Charles Hayward, Liars, Black Dice, James Chance & the Contortions, Gang Gang Dance, The Dresden Dolls, Six Finger Satellite, and Wolf Eyes.

The artistic sound is the psychedelic Rock that twin guitars work that is full of sensitivity by the freedom that is not bound by stereotype.

Formed by high school students Dave Neumann and Craig Hute (ex-The Blazers), they added Larry Smith and Paul Staack and started playing live shows in the area, including Cedar Rapids, IA and Rock Island, Illinois.  In April 1967 they recorded two Hute originals arranged by Neumann - “I Don’t Know” and “Direction of Mind” - at the Fredlo studio in Davenport. The 45 did well locally, selling as many as 1,000 copies, Once the band was out of high school and mostly attending college, they played shows as far away as Champaign, Illinois and Minneapolis.  Later in 1967 or early 1968 they returned to Fredlo to cut an album of Hute's songs. The band had 100 copies pressed and gave them away. Shadoks reissued the album in 2007, adding a little color to the line drawing that was the front cover."

Stylistically, their early sounds have been compared with [a=Television Personalities], [a=White Fence], [a=Thee Oh Sees], [a=The Clean], and [a=King Tuff].

Originally together from 1981-1983, they played basement and club shows fairly often. Aside from the 1983 cassette [i]Flex Your Mind[/i], though, no recorded material was available from them until 1998's [i][r=6511556][/i] CD-R anthology. Several songs on the album were produced by their friend (outsider psychedelic singer-songwriter) [a=Bobb Trimble].

At their first-ever gig, the band distributed a simultaneously prank-ish and poker-faced ""manifesto"", using '60s rock album liner notes as a wobbly template. It began:
""…Was it only 3 or 4 weeks ago that the future PREFAB MESSIAHS first pooled their cosmic energies and talents, and – crooning their messages about our Plastic Age – decided to totally revolutionize Pop Music? The Concept was shocking in its boldness – 4 young men with a Destiny – from the Store 24 to Mister Donut their eyes burned with what they saw, even as they lapped it up faster than a small order of McDonald's fries. Reality could not keep the PREFAB MESSIAHS down! Still, if the Media is the Message, just what are these guys talking about? In short, they're talking about you and me and no one in particular – about the kind of Eternal Struggle that most ""bands"" and ""musicians"" don't even realize exists…""
Armed with borrowed guitars, puny amps, and a mission to confound the status quo, the three Clark University undergrads began a unique post-punk musical trajectory through the burgeoning-yet-insular Wormtown (Worcester, MA) underground. 

The stark reality of the Reagan Era had already taken hold, with its yuppie-driven consumerist, conformist and ""product""-focused fetish culture. In an attempt to deal with it all, our heroes sought refuge in the Dada reverie and post-WWII existentialism that ended up yielding their moniker. In the New Religion of mall culture, product placement and instant gratification, ""prefab messiahs"" like Ronald McDonald and the Pillsbury Dough Boy were trotted out by their corporate masters to replace the old guard of unprofitable prophets.

That was the working Concept, at least – and the The Prefabs mischievously (naively?) married it to an unlikely collision of primitive post-punk, grainy psych, and left-field garage pop – all at a time when terms like ""indie"" and ""alternative"" weren't even bandied about yet.

The Prefab Messiahs reunited (or as they say, ""re-franchised"") several times for one-off shows and festivals before finally officially reuniting in 2012. Releases of archival and new material followed on [l=Burger Records], [l=Klyam Records] and [l=Summersteps Records] (archival material had already been reissued on [l=Almost Ready Records] and [l=Fixed Identity].

The group’s sound ranges from southern psychedelia to progressive composition— all with a spontaneous yet pop-like sensibility.

TOC’s debut album, Time to Go (June 2015), was recorded with Grammy-nominated producer John Keane (R.E.M., Widespread Panic) and garnered praise from Relix Magazine as a “confident and polished debut album.” Shortly after, the band won the 2016 Flagpole Athens Music Award for best “Jam/Funk” band and has since headlined the city’s nationally acclaimed festival, AthFest.

March 2017 saw the release of Point of Reference
which was recorded in Athens, Ga. and produced by Drew Vandenberg (of Montreal, Kishi Bashi, Futurebirds). Fueled by Vandenberg’s experimental leanings, the sophomore effort displays maturity in songwriting and embraces more risk-taking in the studio. The LP demonstrates an urge to break genre restrictions as it draws inspiration from 70’s AOR and contemporaries like My Morning Jacket. Nearly one year after its release, Point of Reference earned the band a second feature in Relix through its notably “lush soundscapes and clear, purposeful compositions.”

In the fall of 2018, the group returned to Keane to record what would become its third full-length release.
Peel came in May 2020 and solidified TOC’s sonic spectrum; heartfelt anthems with catchy choruses ride alongside instrumental mastery with psychedelic undertones. With its rich vocal harmonies, hooky riffing, and succinct songwriting, the album embellishes much of what Time to Go sought and captures the band’s most current sound.

The Orange Constant thrives on creating songs that differ from one another and possess their own inspired character. The band consistently tours the American East and shares bills with acts such as Perpetual Groove, TAUK, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Ripe and CBDB. The group is: Andrew Brantley (guitar/vocals), Nickalous Benson (guitar/vocals), Tyler Walker (bass/vocals), Chris Freiberg (keyboards) and Sam Groveman (drums).

“The Georgia-based band imbues tracks with sonic textures to create thoughtful indie-rock that is as ready to play in your earbuds as it is to boom through concert halls.” – Raffaela Kenny-Cincotta, Relix Magazine

“Eclectic rock n’ roll, everything from blissful southern rock and indie jams to urban funk.” – Grant Purvis (Point of Reference review)

“The Orange Constant’s confident and polished debut album Time to Go is laden with connective riffs and melodious charm. Much of the album evokes a 70’s FM AOR vibe, without appearing self conscious” – Larson Sutton, Relix Magazine

The Orange Constant has pushed its way into a very competitive southeast music scene, where they’ve been able to stand out as completely unique to their peers. It’s that seamless blend of jam-rock and pop sensibilities that continues to serve the ensemble — a melodic force that will only get stronger in the coming years. – Garret K. Woodward, Smoky Mountain News

“They have hit a home run on their first trip to the plate. From the first strains of “Emily” all the way through to the jammed-out coda to “Ask Me to Jump,” Time to Go is a pure delight. You will hear influences throughout the disk, but this is fresh and exciting.” – Scott Hopkins, Music Fest News"

Several obsessive years with Colombian traditional music and instruments were the result of a defense mechanism to cope with being an immigrant preteen in the late 1990s United States. Victor-Andres Cruz ""El Guámbito"" found refuge and a profound sense of identity rooted in these sounds. Raised as an amalgamation between the Colombian countryside, Florida, New England and New York City, Victor created a voice and a place where all worlds converge. 

Influenced by cumbia, bullerengue, gaita music, Colombian Andean songs, Southern Mali’s wassoulou music, Sahara’s desert blues, as well as 60s and 70s delirious psychedelia from Africa and South America, Nemegata is a mystical fierce power trio currently stretching its roots in Austin. 

On August 10, 2018 Casa del Indio Discos released Nemegata’s first single; a lo-fi, raw sounding recording which took place at a rehearsal space in Queens, N.Y., using a 4-track cassette recorder. The tracks were produced in collaboration by ""Niño Lento"" and played on drums by ""Dilemastronauta,"" two of the masterminds behind the emblematic [a=El Combo Chimbita].

89313,2827,1070161,Italy,Brainticket,Cottonwoodhill,1971,34.3,7,"['LP', 'Album']","['Electronic', 'Rock']","['Krautrock', 'Psychedelic Rock', 'Space Rock', 'Experimental', 'Acid Rock']","Switzerland-based Krautrock band born out of a 60's jazz group featuring Belgian born keyboardist Joel Vandroogenbroeck. They are considered by many to be pioneers of early European psychedelic and spaced-out cosmic music. Brainticket was most active in the early 1970s, and known for its use of exotic instruments and jazz-inspired compositions. The only constant member has been Belgian musician Joel Vandroogenbroeck. The band continued to perform concerts and release albums in the 2000s. Vandroogenbroeck died in 2019.

The band was originally called [a1983215] (as can be seen on a 1970 single) but by 1971 that name became the title of their debut album and the band's name was Brainticket. The album featured British vocalist [a442106], and it immediately ran into controversy for its association with psychedelic drugs. Much to groups annoyance, the album came with a warning label stating ""only listen once a day to this record. Your brain might be destroyed.” This approach led to the album being banned in several countries.

After the untimely death of guitarist [a442103], Vandroogenbroeck moved to Italy and met an American woman named Carole Muriel. Joined by a pair of Swiss musicians, guitarist Rolf Hug and bassist Martin Sacher, and percussionist Barni Palm, the new line-up released 1972’s Psychonaut, issued at the time in Italy and Germany only. This album was more accessible and song-oriented than its predecessor while still maintaining a unique and progressive sound.

A rock opera collaboration followed, [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/436180-Tito-Schipa-Jr-Orfeo-9]Orfeo9[/url], before Vandroogenbroeck, Muriel and Palm began work on an album based on the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Celestial Ocean told the story of after-life Egyptian kings traveling through space and time, from the desert land to the pyramids. Released in 1973, the album was hailed as the definitive Brainticket experience.

Adventure in 1980 and Voyage in 1982 were released before Brainticket were disbanded. Vandroogenbroeck then made a series of recordings for the German library label Coloursound, who supplied ambient and mood music film and TV documentaries. Various synonyms were used for these releases

1983 Brainticket reunited with Willy Seefeldt, Hans Deyssenroth and Bruno Spoerri for a concert in Zurich at the symposium ""Computer And Music"". More concerts and festivals followed in the following year. In 1985, Brainticket released a cassette of a live concert in Zurich, New Age Concert, performed by Vandroogenbroeck, Seefeldt, Hans Deyssenroth, and singer Stephanie Wolff.

The Brainticket name was used for the 2000 album Alchemic Universe with Carole Muriel and Lance Bunda.

In August 2011, a newly formed Brainticket lineup, led by Vandroogenbroeck, toured with progressive-rock band Nektar, which had Brainticket performing their very first American concert on August 17, 2011, at B.B. King's in New York City. Brainticket music started to excite again, another tour was planned for 2013 with Nik Turner.

Joel Vandroogenbroeck died on December 23, 2019, in Guadalajara, Mexico"

The group then signed with Atlantic Records after the suggestion of producer [a219989], and released their second album ""Back in the USA"". In 1971, they released their third and final album ""High Time"", this time with Fred Smith at the helm of the band (as the two previous records had Kramer on that role).

Tetuzi Akiyama is a highly unique and experimental guitarist heavily applying free improvisation and noise. Besides guitar, he also plays electronics, viola, and self-made instruments.

Akiyama became an enthusiastic hard rock fan when he was eleven years old, and started playing electric guitar at the age of thirteen. Later, he also came to be very interested in free improvisation and classical music. He formed the improvised music band Madhar in 1987. He also started playing classical viola, and formed the Hikyo String Quintet in 1994. The band, which played avant-garde improvised classical music, consisted of a viola, two cello, and two violin players, and included Taku Sugimoto on cello. Sugimoto soon left the band, which thus became a quartet. Later that year, Akiyama and Sugimoto launched their guitar duo, Akiyama-Sugimoto. They played gigs in New York in 1995, and in the Midwest (including Chicago and Detroit) in '96. For about a year starting in early 1994, Akiyama was also a member of Nijiumu, one of guitarist Keiji Haino's bands.

Recently Akiyama has two improvised music projects: Sutekina Tea Time, a duo with Takashi Matsuoka (guitar, vocal); and Mongoose, a trio with Sugimoto and Utah Kawasaki (analog synthesizer). Since 1998, together with Sugimoto and Toshimaru Nakamura (no-imput mixing board), he has been organizing an inspiring monthly concert series, The Improvisation Meeting at Bar Aoyama (renamed The Experimental Meeting in '99, and Meeting at Off Site in 2000)."

The influences are diverse, though the most  predominant are early 20th century jazz, 1950s Rock-n-Roll, and 1970s punk rock.

After spending the better part of his early twenties in and out of psychiatric units and rehabs, singer/songwriter/guitarist Tony Bones found himself somewhere in Delray Beach, Florida, and began to play his songs solo. He soon found a band grew up around him, and the outfit started gaining interest from their now infamous shows at their local 24-hour laundromat, and their guerilla infiltration of open mic nights. Since then, with the tremendous help and support of friends and fans, past and present members, and a whole lotta elbow grease, Viva Le Vox has been able to tour extensively, and independently release 3 albums to date: Desperation Alley (2009), Wayward Ones (2010), and Dirt For Sale (2012)."

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights.

The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

Co-founder of seminal group [a=Traffic], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee.

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

The group's self-titled debut record was written across several years and line-up changes. Released in 2011, the first album eventually became a favorite of music directors at NPR, who featured many of the tracks as interstitial music on the nationally syndicated ""Morning Edition"" program. The independently produced, self-released record was an expansive and wide-ranging double LP which established the band's sound as well as their dedicated fanbase. Tracks from the record, as well as a newer exclusive track, were featured in the award-winning 2013 documentary Code Black.

Their second release, The Madrean (an extended homage to the American Southwest which the band calls home) was heralded as a more developed, cohesive, and dynamic set of thematically related compositions with profound emotional resonance. The Madrean landed on several year-end ""Best of 2014"" lists and further solidified the band's reputation as well as its small but ardent cult following. The double LP vinyl edition features a stunning 12-page booklet of manipulated landscape photography which merges with the eight often lengthy, interconnected tracks to evoke the story behind The Madrean.

For their latest self-produced release, Sondersongs, the band honed their focus down to ten tracks clocking in under 45 minutes — their first single LP. Although based in similar musical ground as the first two records, on Sondersongs the band is not afraid to bend the listener's ear toward a wider range of genre references and nods to decades past, with individual tracks shifting from plaintive piano pieces and chiming acoustic passages to shimmering dream pop guitar tones, more elaborate horn arrangements, and blaring rock anthems. 

The concept of ""sonder"" comes from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, which defines it as: 

“The realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own — populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness — an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”

The origin of this group is with two coworkers, who shared an interest in progressive music. Ted Thomas and Patrick McFarland originally became friends in 1998 at an Austin Texas computer Company.

Mick revealed that he was learning to play the stick. In 2000 Ted finally got a drum set, and contacted Mick. Patrick joined on keyboards, and they began jamming as a trio. Still, they needed a guitarist. In 2001 Joe Funk's band Two Sheds (with whom they had a friendly relationship) broke up. They were more than happy to bring him into the group.
2002 was an eventful year. They picked the name, and recorded a demo. They received an invitation to play the ""Cattleprog"" festival, but Patrick had decided to pursue other musical avenues (namely Copperdown). After placing an ad, they found keyboardist Thad Miller."

Born 21 December 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
Died 4 December 1993 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

Frank Vincent Zappa was of Italian origin, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. Frank Zappa grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock idiom, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [a=Igor Stravinsky], [a=Karlheinz Stockhausen], and [a=Edgard Varèse]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll, and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, Zappa was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless, and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans -- even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.

Zappa was a prolific record-maker, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight], and [l=Barking Pumpkin Records].  And through distribution deals with [l=Rykodisc] and [l=Rhino Entertainment Company]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [l=Warner Bros. Records] and the now-defunct [l=MGM]. In the '80s, Zappa gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [l=Rykodisc]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.

In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that Zappa was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] (ZFT) continued with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT, until her death in 2015. The ZFT produced numerous posthumous releases and remasters of the back catalog. The children inherited the ZFT and remain in the industry,  [a237886] the force behind [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/2843814-Dweezil-Zappa-Plays-Zappa] ""[i]Zappa Plays Zappa[/i]"" [/url] as well as an accomplished guitarist in his own right; [a296279], [a1635870] and the more reserved [a296276].

Born June 22, 1948 in Upper Darby, a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
 
Todd Rundgren began his career in blues band Woody's Truck Stop but left to form Nazz in 1967 who charted with ""Open My Eyes"" and ""Hello It's Me."" He left Nazz in 1969 to pursue a solo career and released Runt (1970), Runt: The Ballad of Todd Rundgren (1971) and double LP Something/Anything? (1972) on which he singly wrote, performed and produced 3 of the 4 sides of the album, the 4th side being a single live take with a studio band.
 
Rundgren also took on production projects for other groups at Bearsville Studios whilst his musical boundaries stretched from Pop to Heavy Metal to Soul as demonstrated by 'A Wizard, A True Star' (1973), followed by another double album 1974's Todd and 1975's Initiation. At this time he also started to release progressive and experimental live and studio material with his backing band Utopia.
 
Rundgren continued to produce solo material, notably Faithful (1976) featuring one side of originals and one side of covers from 1966, Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978), Healing (1981), The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect (1983) and the aptly named A Cappella (1985). Utopia disbanded in 1986 having released a string of live and studio albums under the Todd Rundgren/Utopia banner all of which featured Rundgren's seemingly inexhaustible songwriting, vocal and performance contributions.
 
After a break he released the live studio album Nearly Human (1989) followed by 2nd Wind (1991) performed before a live audience who were instructed to remain silent. In 1993 Rundgren reinvented himself again on the Internet as TR-i (""Todd Rundgren interactive"") and released No World Order (1993) followed by The Individualist (1995). His Patronet work, which trickled out to subscribers over more than a year, was released in 2000 as One Long Year.
 
Rundgren returned to recording under his own name for With a Twist, an album of bossa-nova covers of his older material. Also released were Reconstructed which features techno remixes of Rundgren and Utopia tracks by other artists and Todd Rundgren and His Friends which contains various artists remakes and remixes Rundgren songs.
 
In 2004, Rundgren released Liars and in 2005, following considerable rumour and speculation it was announced that he was joining the line-up of 80's rock band The Cars, now renamed as The New Cars. A live album The New Cars: It's Alive, was released in 2006.

Calling their style ""Northern Hyperblast"", Kataklysm's early work is characterized by vocalist Sylvain Houde's inhuman growls, shrieks, and the esoteric, mystical lyrics and themes that he wrote for the band.

Houde departed sometime after the release of their third album [r=655067], a change which saw the band shift gears; their 1998 follow up [r=1785182] utilized an altogether more melodic sound and lacked all mystical elements on the album with replacement vocalist and ex Bass player Maurizio Iacono's almost hardcore vocal delivery.

Recordings since 2000 have seen Kataklysm return to its extreme Metal roots and the band continues to record in this style."

Split-up in 1994, reformed in 2001.

Country of origin: Chile
Location: Concepción
Status: Active
Formed in: 1987
Genre: Death Metal
Lyrical themes: Feelings, Hate, Death, Torture
Current label: Rawforce Productions
Years active: 1987-1994, 2001-present.

Cancerbero originally formed in 1987 by vocalist Peter and split up in 1994 with two demos recorded before that (Guardian of Hell in 1988 & Perpetual Agony -1991). Many years went by and Cancerbero was reformed in 2001 with two original members (Peter-bass and vocals, and Enrique ""Feto""-guitars) and a new drummer called Milton. With this line-up the band composed new songs full of heaviness and brutality keeping the old school vein. In September 2002 a new guitarist named Esteban (who played in Black Moon) was added to the band (and played with the cult band Massakre), but a new internal problem appeared and the band split up again in 2003. Three years later, in 2006, the band reformed once again, but with a new drummer named Erik. In November 2006, Esteban & Erik left the band for personal reasons and Milton returned to Cancerbero.

It was originally released on [l=King Of The Monsters], but a larger record label spotted the band and signed them, and the album was re-released on their current record label, [l=Metal Blade Records], in 2006 with a bonus track. After being signed, Andrew Arcurio was kicked out of the group for lack of interest and participation and was replaced by Bobby Thompson. Elliot Sellers also left the group after completing the writing and recording process for their Metal Blade debut album, Genesis (2007); he was replaced by Jon Rice during the YouTube tryouts.

In 2009, they released Ruination which has been their highest charting album to date at #42 on the Billboard 200. In 2011, they released an EP titled Gloom which was limited to 2500 copies worldwide. By 2012, the band released their 3rd album Demonocracy, with Sun Eater following two years later in 2014. After nearly a decade, the band released their album Moon Healer in 2024.

Naglfar was formed by Jens Rydén (vocals, guitar) and Kristoffer Olivius (bass), and originally they were called Uninterred. The two were soon joined by Ulf Andersson (drums) from Nocturnal Rites. As Jens Rydén wanted to focus on vocals only, guitarists Morgan Hansson and Fredrik Degerström also joined the band. However, Fredrik Degerström was asked leave because of different personal and musical opinions. He was replaced by Andreas Nilsson and then the band changed name to Naglfar. 

They entered Garageland Studios and the result was a one-track promo. Ulf couldn't handle the drums and he later lost interest in the band, so he left to focus on his other project. He was replaced by a drum machine. They returned to the studio and recorded their first demo called ""Stellae Trajectio"", released in November 1994. Some months after the release they were contacted by Wrong Again Records and they were signed. They had also recruited a new drummer named Mattias Holmgren. In 1995 they band entered Abyss Studio in Sweden and recorded their debut album called ""Vittra"". 

Mattias Holmgren left after the release to play in his other band Embracing. The band took a break for a couple of months in order to find a new drummer. They didn't find any permanent replacement but they got help from Morgan Lie from Auberon and Johan Moritz from the band Disorge. The Japanese label Toys Factory wanted the band to appear on a Iron Maiden tribute-cd and they went to Sunlight Studio in Stockholm to record ""The Evil That Men Do"". They also managed to find a new drummer called Mattias Grahn. Naglfar then played some gigs and released a picture 7"" called ""When Autumn Storms Come"". 

In 1998 the recorded and released their second full-length album ""Diabolical"". In 2000 Morgan Hansson left the band but was replaced by Marcus ""Vargher"" Norman from Bewitched. Same year recorded the MCD called ""Ex Inferis"" at the Ballerina Studio. It contained a new studio track, a cover and three previously released tracks. 

In 2003 they released ""Sheol"" which gained them major success.

The band originally started as COMPROMISE YOU NEED, but was formally renamed into COFFINS by UCHINO and NEGISHI in 1996. After a lot of member changes, YOU joined the band as their drummer in 1999. But, as each member began activities in other bands, COFFINS was stopped in 2000.
In 2003 the band came together again and changed their style to the dark Doom/Death sound, influenced by CELTICFROST or HELLHAMMER. UCHINO and YOU left their other projects in order to concentrate on their work with COFFINS. SENTOU joined as the new bass player. They released two demo CDrs in 2003 and 2004, most of which formed the base to their first regular full length album Mortuary in Darkness in 2005.
They also toured and played several gigs in Japan.

In December 2005, SENTOU left the band for musical differencies and was replaced by KOREEDA (TRIKORONA/ex. CURTAIN RAIL). This line-up recorded their 2nd album THE OTHER SIDE OF BLASPHEMY.

What they played was soon to become the first example of the second wave of doom metal, which mixed elements of other uber-heavy genres such as death and black metal. 

""Towards The Sinister"" was the band's first recording ever, an early demo which immediately got them a deal for their first real release, the classic EP ""Symphonaire Infernus Et Spera Empyrium"". ""As the Flower Withers"", the band's very first full length, followed in 1992, allowing the group to gain more popularity. ""Turn Loose The Swans"" and ""The Angel And The Dark River"" (released in 1994 and 1996 respectively) followed the original album's success, but took the band's style further, mixing all sorts of different musical styles together. 

Despite My Dying Bride's quite evident commercial success the band never stopped experimenting (1998's ""34.788%...Complete"" demonstrating this more than any other release) and has now settled with it's own original style which differs quite a lot from other band's, even though it has given birth to many pioneers (and some say a whole subgenre!).

On June 27, 2008, the band announced that due to Sarah Stanton's pregnancy she has been replaced by Katie Stone. Stone left the band only a year later, she was replaced by Shaun Macgowan.
On June 6, 2014, the band announced the departure of Hamish Glencross, and that Calvin Robertshaw would rejoin the band 15 years after he left My Dying Bride."

Journey Into Darkness is the solo project of ex-guitarist Brett Clarin from the death doom metal band Sorrow (Roadrunner, 1991-1993). The music is a unique style of symphonic black death metal with dark yet expansive orchestral layers. Dark and sinister melodies prevail all while maintaining heaviness and intensity.

""After the Roadrunner death metal purge in the early 90s, Sorrow called it quits. I started writing music electronically that was reminiscent of the intros and interludes on death and black metal albums. The first album ""Life Is a Near Death Experience"" was the result, an all synth album that combined dungeon synth with death and black metal. That was in 1996. 

Many years later, in 2017, I decided to resurrect JID, but this time I wanted it to be much heavier and more like symphonic black metal. So, I added guitars and brought in vocalist Jei Doublerice. The second album ""Multitudes Of Emptiness"" is the bridge between the old all synth style and the new heavier symphonic black death metal style. Half the tracks are synth, half are with guitars and vocals.

The 3rd release ""Infinite Universe Infinite Death"" completed the transition to symphonic black death metal with a bit of doom reminiscent of the early days in Sorrow. It is a result of 30 years of songwriting.""

Along the way, Stoeckel enlisted the guitar talents of Joel Tinnel, who introduced him to Bruce Gordon (aka Mr. Encrypto), who had several CD's to his credit. Gordon subsequently introduced Stacy Carson to the group. Read the band's own words on how it all came together.

The group had so much fun creating a first song together that they decided to form a band and release an entire album. The effort was truly cooperative: each member wrote, recorded, engineered, produced, and mixed these 12 songs in every combination. ""Pop Co-Op"" was the obvious band name.

Quincy was a New Wave/Power pop band from New Jersey. They released their first album on Columbia records in 1980 entitled ""Quincy"" and an EP in 1983 entitled ""Don't Say No"", using the band name [a1696916].

The band was started by two sets of brothers, Stephen and Brian Butler, and Gerald and Alex Takach. The brothers had met while going to Haddon Heights High School in New Jersey during the 1970s and eventually forming Quincy, where they started off with an acoustic/electric soft rock sound with 4 part vocal harmonies. In 1976, Quincy did a month long tour of the midwest with Bob Holden on drums. A few months later on Friday August 13, 1976, while playing at JC Dobbs club on South Street in Philadelphia, Alex Takach was mysteriously murdered.

After a short period of inactivity, the band re-emerged embracing the Punk/New Wave movement. Gerald Takach took the stage name Gerald Emerick and the band added Wally Smith (aka Metro) on keyboards. They found their way to CBGB in New York and became a regular fixture in the late 1970s. They were managed by the owner of CBGB, Hilly Kristal.

Quincy released a single on CBGB Records titled ""Can't Live In A Dream""/""Salvation Fantasy"". The band eventually signed with Columbia/CBS Records. The debut album was released to favorable reviews and enthusiasm at radio stations.

Shortly after the first album came out, Quincy Jones sued them for using his name. CBS Records did not help the band with the lawsuit. (Both the band and Jones recorded for CBS, and Jones was vastly more powerful than the band.) The band Quincy and Quincy Jones eventually settled out of court. The band then changed its name to [a1696916]. The settlement stipulated that no mention could be made of the lawsuit in public.

After a long battle to release a second record, the album ""Don't Say No"" was released under the new name [a1696916]. In addition to a new name, the band took on a new musical direction adding horns and percussion and a more layered approach. Without the support of the label and the lack of press, even the band's fan base didn't know of their new record.

The band soon split up and went their separate ways in various musical and theatrical endeavors. The Butler brothers eventually founded the band [a777576].

The Palisades were neither scruffy nor clean cut, played neither L.A. big hair-poseur hard rock nor popular synth dance music (the dominate or soon to be dominate muzaks of the ‘80’s), played virtually no current radio hits, yet quixotically, became incredibly popular in a very short time in the beach cities with their straight forward mixture of heavily ‘60’s influenced originals and pumped up rock n’ roll oldies.

They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles.""

The band is most known for their tracks ""Surrender,"" ""I Want You To Want Me,"" ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame,"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street,"" for American sitcom ""That 70's Show,"" (season 2 onwards), and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program ""The Colbert Report.""

Surprisingly, for the age of the band, the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also, the Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be ""Cheap Trick Day.""  They also took the 25th spot in ""VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.""

Dominating the South Bay music scene for two years (1982-1983), the Palisades in some ways epitomized the raw sound and look of the area’s musical youth community. Their group following was almost exclusively high school teenagers, too young to get into even 18 and over clubs, much less full drinking bars, which is why the band was never very successful in clubs but enormously popular in every other respect.

The Palisades were neither scruffy nor clean cut, played neither L.A. big hair-poseur hard rock nor popular synth dance music (the dominate or soon to be dominate muzaks of the ‘80’s), played virtually no current radio hits, yet quixotically, became incredibly popular in a very short time in the beach cities with their straight forward mixture of heavily ‘60’s influenced originals and pumped up rock n’ roll oldies.

No one sounded like the Palisades in 1982 and 1983. The music they wrote and performed was the music of being young – a celebration of youth."

During her time at the academy, she continued playing the piano and writing songs, nurturing her blossoming songwriting skills. Upon graduation, she moved to Hell's Kitchen, where she waitressed five nights a week and performed at local clubs on open mic nights, honing her craft and developing a stage presence. At home, she would often stay up until 4 a.m. recording demos on a four-track machine, and was signed to A&M Records in 2001. Her first video, for the song ""A Thousand Miles,"" was released even as she continued recording her debut album, and it became an instant smash on MTV, as well as cracking the American Top Ten.

Sodom's original line-up consisted of Tom Angelripper, Bloody Monster and Aggressor. The band was initially formed by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. Taking inspiration from bands such as Motörhead, Tank, Venom and Accept, they released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer (none of which were recorded with Bloody Monster, who was replaced by Chris Witchunter). Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the In the Sign of Evil EP (generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who did not last long himself, and left following the recording of ""In The Sign Of Evil"". A replacement was found in the form of Michael ""Destructor"" Wulf. They then went and recorded Obsessed by Cruelty, their full length debut. It featured music that was mostly in the same vein of In The Sign of Evil. Wulf did not last long himself, and later went and joined Kreator (this relationship would not last long either, and the man would later die in 1993 after a tragic motorcycle accident).

For the most part, the band was not taken seriously at first, as various press sources stated them as nothing more than ""a second rate Venom clone with semi inventive lyrics"". One member would change that. This member was Frank ""Blackfire"" Gosdzik, who came in to fill the empty guitar spot Wulf left behind thrash metal. Frank had convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond the realms of the horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom, and that themes such as politics, society, and war were being embraced. Tom was already very interested in various wars, yet viewed them as stupid and outright dumb. This new inspiration culminated into Frank's full length debut with the band, Persecution Mania. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great praise (as well as a mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on Persecution Mania's cover), and they soon embarked on a tour of Europe with the Swiss thrash metal outfit Coroner. After touring for the better part of 1987 and 1988, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The final product was titled Agent Orange, and it sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. This made Sodom famous, giving them world wide critical acclaim, and securing their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great three teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, Agent Orange has sold more than any other German thrash metal album all over the world.

In January 2018, Tom Angelripper announced the departure of Bernd ""Bernemann"" Kost and Markus ""Makka"" Freiwald from the band. Two weeks later he announced the new line up including Frank Blackfire and Yorck Segatz on guitars and Stefan ""Husky"" Hüskens on the drums. This is the first time in the history of Sodom that the band has four members.

137126,1709775,15235510,,Testament (2),Titans Of Creation,2020,58.5,12,"['FLAC', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Thrash'],"Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from San Francisco, California (USA).

Initially founded as [a2354458] in 1983 by Eric Peterson (guitar) his cousin Derrick Ramírez (guitar and vocals) and Mike Ronchette (drums). Same year Steve ""Zetro"" Souza joined as vocalist, Gregg Christian as bassist and Louie Clemente replaced Mike on drums. In 1984 Alex Skolnick replaced Derrick on the guitar and they began rehearsing for their first demo.

In 1985 they recorded their first demo called ""First Strike Is Deadly"" and in 1986 they changed their name into Testament after parting ways with Zetro (who left to join fellow Bay-area thrashers Exodus) and hooking up with new vocalist Chuck Billy. After the successful debut album ""The Legacy"" they played the Dynamo festival in Holland and recorded a live EP. Their second album made Testament one of the world's biggest metal bands and a tour was arranged with Megadeth, Voivod, Anthrax, Judas Priest and others. Their third album ""Practice What You Preach"" sold more than 400,000 copies. 

After the release of 1992's ""The Ritual"", Louie Clemente and lead guitarist Alex Skolnick left the band and were replaced by guitarist Glen Alvelais and drummer Paul Bostaph, both from the band Forbidden.  In 1995, after more line up changes which included guitarist James Murphy replacing Alvelais and a few different guys behind the drums, the band was dropped from Atlantic Records and they therefore decided to create their own label called Burnt Offerings Inc. In 1996 Testament split up during the pre-production for the seventh album. Chuck told that he and Eric would form a new band called Dog Faced Gods while James left to do a personal project and Greg formed the band Flangue. However Eric and Chuck soon resurrected the Testament name with various players. 1997's ""Demonic"" featured founding member Derrick Ramirez (playing bass) and drummer Gene Hoglan.  1999's ""The Gathering"" saw the return of James Murphy, along with bassist Steve DiGiorgio and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

In 2005, after several years of playing with different line ups and Chuck's battle with cancer, he and Eric reunited with ""classic line up"" members Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian, and Louie Clemente for a series of show which resulted in the release of a live album.  Moving forward, the original members opted to continue working together, with exception of Louie Clemente, who was unable to commit to the band full time and was replaced by ex-Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker.  Barker's tenure was brief, as visa problems prevented him from working in the US, and he was replaced by Paul Bostaph.

Testament began recording their new album, Dark Roots of Earth, on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a ""serious injury""; however, he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Paul on the drum tracks.  It was announced on December 1st that Paul Bostaph left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drums tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and a hope that he will continue with the band for the foreseeable future.  In 2014, it was announced that Testament and Greg Christian had parted ways.

As they were influenced by 80s heavy and thrash metal the brothers decided to leave the death metal band, ""Dark Millennium,"" that they were members of at the time and form a new group. Initially the group was made up of just the two brothers providing guitars, vocals and drums, and they made no recordings until 1997.

In 1997 they released their first demo, ""The First Necromancy"", which was recorded without bass. The following year a second demo ""Turn In Your Graves"" was recorded the same way, but due to economic problems, it was never released.

Sometime after this their song ""Metal Mania"" was featured on a compilation of local metal bands called ""To Meet The Storm.""

In 2000 they were contacted by Colombia's [l60247] who released a vinyl mini-album entitled Witching Metal, limited to 500 copies. At around the same time [a1571618] was recruited as a full time bassist and was included in the recording sessions for ""Witching Metal"". The following year [l34772] signed the band to release their debut full length album Sorceress Bitch on CD.

Late in 2002, [a1571618] was fired from the band and soon replaced by [a1571745] (AKA Enforcer).

In 2004 ""Desecration Of Evil"" from ""Turn In Your Graves"" was featured on ""Ataque demoniáco Vol. 1"" a compilation issued on vinyl released by the South American label ""Dark Desires Productions"" and the French label [l43304] licensed Sorceress Bitch from [l34772].

In 2005 the band founded their own label [l135790]. One of the first actions of the label was to purchase the rights to Witching Metal from [l60247] and reissue it on CD. Additionally the North American label [l135909] licensed Sorceress Bitch from [l34772] and released a picture disc version which featured ""Metal Mania"" as a bonus track. Following this the Japanese label [l49774] released The First Necromancy, a CD that compiled both of their original demos as well as ""Metal Mania"" from the ""To Meet The Storm"" compilation. 

In 2006 after six months of mixing and mastering No Anesthesia was released by [l135790].

Hugo, Carlos and Edison are also members of the Colombian band Nightmare.

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias [a=Schmier] (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Motörhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

[a=Schmier] performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band [a=Elvenking].

The story begins in Thunder Bay, Ontario, in 2016
Matt (guitars) and Justin (vocals, bass, ex-Alphakill) were working together on some songs that Matt had written and arranged over the years...
Matt decided to finally do a proper recording and spoke with Glen Drover about it via Facebook. 
Initially, Matt's friend Derrick Kroll was considered to do all the drum tracks... however when Glen offered to have his brother Shawn Drover play drums... it was a no brainer. 

The guitars were recorded in 4 days in Justin's basement as dry tracks and sent to Glen to be reamped in Windsor Ontario at Glen's home studio. The bass and vocals were done in Winnipeg in Justin's basement as well. Shawn tracked all of his drums in Glen's studio over a 10 day period in August 2017.

Matt was able to gather interest from a few different independent labels however decided to go with Alone Records out of Greece because of Emmanoel’s, the owner’s friendly and up front honest approach to things.

With a 2nd album already written and soon ready to be recorded... it’s just a matter of time before the band blows up at an underground level and hopefully does a proper tour...
As of right now, the band will be playing select festival shows...starting with the Manitoba Metalfest in March 2018 where they will open for the legendary Demolition Hammer.

Derrick Kroll from Alphakill and formerly of Evil Survives will be handling the drum duties at this show.

Also... Jordan Gosselin from the band Dyrewolf in Winnipeg will be playing the bass guitar on the Manitoba show. Jordan is a phenomenal bass player and can play just about any Steve Harris lick there is.

Singer/songwriter [a=Phil Rind]’s interest was in socially-conscious and political speed metal. After several records on [l=Metal Blade], they signed to [l=Hollywood Records] for a short stint, but later returned to Metal Blade to continue their musical career. The band split in 2000, however they reformed again in 2006.

Former drummer Dave McClain went on to join [a=Machine Head (3)] in 1995. Lead guitarist [a=Wiley Arnett] went on to form The Human Condition with [a=St. Madness] vocalist Prophet in July of 2000.

In the summer of 2006, [a=Wiley Arnett] brought his recording equipment to his accountant's house in Arizona and produced the demo for the band A Tragic Comedy.

In 2007, the band reunited to play several shows in Europe, including Wacken Open Air.

In 2009, the band again went to Europe in the Summer to tour some clubs and festivals. Their live performance at Wacken Open Air 2009 is available on CD and DVD.

Napalm Death were originally one of the bands that defined the UK hardcore thrash/punk sound of the mid-late 1980s, along with bands such as [a=Extreme Noise Terror], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Doom+%282%29]Doom[/url] and [a=Sore Throat]. The band has gone through countless line-ups and many former members have gone on to become significant figures in a variety of musical scenes.

Although their debut album ""Scum"" featured members Justin Broadrick (who was also a member of [a=Fall of Because], the band that later became [a=Godflesh], at the time) and Nik Bullen (later part of [a=Scorn]), the first stable line up consisted of Lee Dorrian (vocals), Bill Steer (guitar), Mick Harris (drums) and Shane Embury (bass).

By late 1989, Lee Dorrian, whose vocals epitomized the early Napalm Death sound, had left to form another band (doom metal band [a=Cathedral]) and focus on his label Rise Above. Bill Steer also left to concentrate on his other band, [a=Carcass]. Dorrian was replaced by former death metal band [a=Benediction]'s vocalist Barney Greenway, and an American guitarist, Jesse Pintado, was recruited from fellow Earache label-mates [a=Terrorizer]. A short time later Mitch Harris from Las Vegas' grindcore outfit [a=Righteous Pigs] joined as a second guitarist.

Mick Harris left the band in 1991 and has since been involved in a plethora of solo and joint projects/collaborations as [a=Scorn], [a=Lull], [a=Quoit] etc. He was replaced by Danny Herrera, an old friend of Jesse's from Los Angeles. This line-up lasted until 2004, when Jesse Pintado left the band. Currently the band consists of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and Danny Herrera.

Thrash metal band influenced by the NWOBHM, Hardcore and Progressive Rock. Voïvod are easily identifiable by their use of unusual time signatures, dissonant guitar chords and lyrical themes influenced by post-apocalyptic literature, cold war politics and science fiction.

Founding members Jean-Yves Thériault alias [a=Blacky (2)] (bass) and Denis Bélanger alias [a=Snake (6)] (vocals) departed the band in the early 1990s (though Bélanger would return and leave the band several times until the mid 1990s), guitarist Denis D'Amour alias [a=Piggy] and drummer Michel Langevin alias [a=Away] forged ahead with new member Eric ""E-Force"" Forrest on bass and vocals. Forrest departed in 2001 and Voïvod went on hiatus for a year. The band reformed in 2002 with Denis ""Snake"" Bélanger returning on vocals and ex-[a=Metallica] member Jason ""Jasonic"" Newsted performing bass duties in the studio. 

Voïvod found itself on hiatus once more as guitarist Denis ""Piggy"" D'Amour was diagnosed with cancer of the colon, he passed away in 2005.

In 2009 the band released its twelfth studio album [r=1922763], which features the last music written and recorded by D'Amour.

Currently, Voïvod continues to perform live and still releases albums to critical acclaim. Their album [m1425025] reached number 8 of the Best Metal albums of 2018 in Rolling Stone.

Born in Germany but then relocated to the USA, KMFDM released their first demo tape in 1984 and the first album ""What Do You Know Deutschland?"" in 1986. Heads of the band were Sascha Konietzko and En Esch. In 2000, the band changed to name into MDFMK and tried a contract with a major company. In 2002 they were back as KMFDM without En Esch.

Rumour has it that KMFDM stands for ""Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche Mode"", ""Keep Madonna From Doing Music"" or ""Kylie Minogue Fans Don't Masturbate"", but in fact it is an acronym for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase ""Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid"" (actually kind of a grammatical play upon words juggling with definite articles). This term can only be loosely translated into English as ""No Majority For Pity"" but then loses much of its irony. Thus the grammatically correct phrase ""Kein Mitleid Für die Mehrheit"" (""No Pity For The Majority"") has emerged and is now in common use, even officially. The band now just deals with ""Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit""/""No Pity For The Majority"" to avoid being asked stupid questions about what ""KMFDM"" means for the rest of their lives."

After independently releasing a self-titled debut in 1996, the band garnered mainstream exposure with the support of alternative metal pioneers Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst who aided Deadsy on their long-awaited 2002 album Commencement. Throughout the 2000s, Deadsy toured across the United States, most notably performing on the Family Values Tour. The band released a second major label album, ""Phantasmagore,"" in 2006 before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2007.

However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band.

Catch the band on the big screen and soundtrack in the 2016 horror film The Devil’s Domain. Rising from the Hollywood underground, Luna 13 are a dark electro-metal duo who showcase their blend of black metal, bass music, and industrial rock with occult imagery and theatrical live performances. Emerging in the early 2010s with Phantom Bass Queen, they later signed with Cleopatra Records for the late-decade releases G.O.A.T Witch and Wicked Gods.

The project's creator, known as Dr. Luna, studied Hindu astrology in India, worshiping the ""dark side of the Mother Goddess,"" the Hindu goddess Kali, and the feminine form. Inspired by his many experiences in India, he returned to the United States and adopted the moniker Dr. Luna for his Hollywood-based Luna 13 project. His debut album, Phantom Bass Queen (originally titled Feeling Like My Old Sunny Self Again), was released on Halloween in 2012. He built a following in the industrial underground and went on to sign with Morbit Records the following year. In 2013, he issued the compilation Resurrection in Black, followed by his India-inspired Rakshasi (""female demon"") album, which he released in India on his own independent label, Snake Bite Records. The Empress of Filth -- and accompanying Empress Bee Sides -- arrived in 2014. After issuing the dubstep-tinged A New Kind of Devil, he recruited singer and dancer Lilith Bathory to build upon his already intense live show.

The duo's debut was 2015's The Hollywood Ripper, full of dark local references to death and infamous females like Emily Rose, Marilyn Monroe, and Elisa Lam, who mysteriously died in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2013. A year later, they issued Dark Side of the Sun on Cleopatra Records, further expanding their reach by playing festivals and featuring on both the soundtrack and the film Devil's Domain. The brutal Lilit landed in 2017, highlighting the group's focus on pummeling drums, droning guitars, and beat-driven synths. Closing out the decade, Luna 13 issued G.O.A.T Witch (2018) and Wicked Gods (2019)."

This changed in December 2016 when [a259284] officially became the second member of the band. Nine Inch Nails straddles a wide range of many styles of rock music and other genres that require an electronic sound, which can often cause drastic changes in sound from album to album. However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band. In 2020, Nine Inch Nails was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame."

They were formed in late 2004 by guitarist [a=Mike Sullivan] and bassist [a=Colin DeKuiper], both ex-members of instrumental band [a=dakota/dakota].
Drummer [a=Dave Turncrantz], ex-member of [a=Riddle Of Steel], joined soon after.
They self-released a 4 track CD-EP and signed with Flameshovel (US) and Black Records (UK) for their first full length on CD and to Hewhocorrupts (US) and Friction Records (GER) for the vinyl.
Another limited 7"" came out on Suicide Squeeze. In the autumn of 2007, it was announced that the band had parted ways with [a=Colin DeKuiper]. As a result, the bass tracks on their second album, titled Station, were handled by ex-Botch/These Arms Are Snakes bass player [a=Brian Cook (2)], who then joined the band permanently. The group's third full-length, Geneva, was released on October 20, 2009 and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.

In 2011, Russian Circles signed to Sargent House who had previously only exclusively released the band's albums on limited edition vinyl. Their fourth studio album Empros was released on October 25, 2011. A supporting tour with Deafheaven followed the release. In May, 2013 the group began recording their fifth studio album, produced by [a=Brandon Curtis]. Memorial was released at the end of October 2013 and featured a guest-vocal by [a=Chelsea Wolfe]. Together they embarked on a co-headlining UK/European tour in the fall.

Russian Circles released its sixth studio album Guidance on August 5, 2016 through Sargent House. The album was produced by [a=Kurt Ballou] of [a=Converge] fame. In 2019, the band announced that they had begun writing on their seventh album to follow up their previous effort, Guidance. In May 2019, the name of the seventh album was revealed to be 'Blood Year' and would be released on August 2, 2019.

Born: 21 May 1951 in Oskaloosa, Iowa, USA. 
Died: 4 April 1992 in NYC, New York, USA (aged 40). 

Russell was raised in Oskaloosa, Iowa, where he later studied the cello and began to write his own music. In the early 1970s, he moved to California and studied Indian music at the Ali Akbar Khan School in San Francisco. He met [a=Allen Ginsberg], with whom he began to work, accompanying him on the cello while Allen sang or read his poetry. 

In the mid 1970s, Russell moved to New York City. After an initial period of uncertainty, he contributed to The Flying Hearts in studio work and, occasionally, in performance with David Byrne, Rhys Chatham, Jon Gibson, Peter Gordon, Jerry Harrison, Garret List, Andy Paley, Leni Pickett and Peter Zummo. From 1975 to 1979 this ensemble, together with Glenn Iamaro, Bill Ruyle, and Jon Sholle, performed and recorded the orchestral composition of Instrumentals (Disques du Crépuscule, 1984, Belgium). 

In 1978, Russell wrote and produced ""Kiss Me Again"", under the name Dinosaur. It was the first disco single to be released by Sire Records, and the first of many of Russell's innovative dance tunes. This was followed by ""Is It All Over My Face"" by Loose Joints, released in 1980. In 1982, Russell and William Socolov founded Sleeping Bag records and their first release was his ""24-24 Music"". The number ""Go Bang"", which originated from this album, was remixed as a 12"" single by Francois Kevorkian. 

In 1983, the album ""Tower Of Meaning"" (Chatham Square) was released. This compelling and meditative recording, conducted by Julius Eastman, represents just a fragment of a much larger composition, which includes voices along with its instrumentation. At the same time, he continued to release dance singles such as ""Tell You Today"" (4th And Broadway, 1983) an upbeat dance groove featuring the vocals of Joyce Bowden. Additional dance tunes included ""Wax The Van"" (Jump Street, 1985) with vocals by Lola Blank, wife of notorious Bob, ""Treehouse/Schoolbell"" (Sleeping Bag, 1986) and ""Let's Go Swimming"" (Upside/Rough Trade, 1986). 

During the mid 1980s, Russell gave many performances, either accompanying himself on cello with a myriad of effects, or working with a small ensemble consisting of Mustafa Ahmed, Steven Hall, Elodie Lauten and Peter Zummo. 1986 saw the release of ""World Of Echo"" (Upside/Rough Trade, 1986), which incorporated many of his ideas for pop, dance and classical music for both solo and cello format. This critically acclaimed album was included in Melody Maker's ""Top Thirty Releases of 1986"". Russell also collaborated with a number of choreographers, including John Bernd, Diane Madden, Alison Salzinger, and Stephanie Woodard. 

Russell died of AIDS-related illnesses, and in its obituary the Village Voice wrote: ""his songs were so personal that it seems as though he simply vanished into his music."" 
A documentary about Russell was released by Matt Wolf, titled ""[url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1168662/]Wild Combination: A Portrait Of Arthur Russell[/url]"" (2008).

The project draws energy from the constant fluctuation between seemingly disparate styles, yet Marcloid pulls off the impossible feat again and again of making chaotic deviations and improbable jump-cuts between ideas sound natural. Bursts of harsh textural noise cut into drifts of new age synth bliss, while miniature screamo verses bookend passages of hyper-technical prog rock. Breakbeats collide with death metal-inspired drum programming into cybernetic spikes of intensity. At times, Marcloid offers us some form of pop music, carried in passages of clean vocals and bright synth tones. Though Fire-Toolz weaves together far-flung elements of Marcloid's musical upbringing, the project never engages in outright nostalgia. These vocabularies are not relics of the past dusted off and presented as novelties. They're living traditions that the artist works with in the present tense. "

American band sometimes referred to as CATS. Gained fame as a mystery band whose music was playing during the Grateful Dead's Fare Thee Well's intermissions. As the results & response were so positive the music was given a separate release, and alter further albums followed. The band has continued after Casal died on 2019-08-26.

The project began when Neal Casal was asked by video director Justin Kreutzmann to compose and record more than five hours of original music to be played along with the visuals Kreutzmann was preparing for the Fare Thee Well intermissions. ""The idea was to not only show reverence for the past but to ultimately, move it forward. If there's anything to be learned from the Grateful Dead, it is to dissolve your boundaries, push your limits, and discover your own voice in this world,"" explains Casal, the lead guitarist and co-lyricist for The Chris Robinson Brotherhood and part-time member of Phil Lesh and Friends. Casal initially formed the band specifically to record just for the shows and was joined in the studio by keyboardist Adam MacDougall, a fellow member of Robinson's Brotherhood and Lesh's Friends. The balance of Circles Around The Sun consists of bassist Dan Horne (Beachwood Sparks, Jonathan Wilson) and drummer Mark Levy (The Congress). All of the music on Interludes For The Dead was written collectively - with nothing prepared beforehand or added afterward - and recorded live by engineer J.P. Hesser."

Helvetia's first record, ""The Clever North Wind"" (2006), was released on The Static Cult Label and distributed by Up Records. Their first national exposure was achieved by touring with Built To Spill. Helvetia is produced/performed by Jason Albertini and sustained by a rotating live line-up, which has included C. Dove Amber, Jim Roth and Scott Plouf. Their third release, ""Headless Machine of the Heart"" (2008) was recorded entirely on a 4-track tape machine. Helvetia continues to release music through The Static Cult Label (which is helmed by Duster-mate Clay Parton). The name Helvetia is the female personification of Switzerland, the childhood home of Jason Albertini.

From another info page:

Helvetia (pronounced “hel-vee-shuh"") is the project of Jason Albertini, a previous member of UP Records band Duster and current bassist of Built To Spill. The band consists of former Duster bandmate Dove Amber, along with Zeke Howard, formerly of Love As Laughter (Glacial Pace, Sub Pop, UP Records), Samantha Stidham, and Jim Roth, also of Built To Spill. Having grown up in Basel, Switzerland, Albertini chose the name ‘Helvetia’ — the female personification of Switzerland — because of its lyrical and poetic sound. Between 2006 and 2011, Helvetia put out seven releases on The Static Cult Label, run by Duster’s Clay Parton, and toured with bands like Built To Spill and Meat Puppets. After running monitors and performing other roadie duties for Built To Spill for years, Albertini officially joined the band in 2012.

Known for recording most of Helvetia’s albums himself on a 4-track (except for 2008’s The Acrobats, recorded at the Seattle-based studio of Built To Spill’s Jim Roth), Albertini’s songs are raw, experimental, and psych-tinged. 2012’s Nothing In Rambling, the band’s first release for Joyful Noise Recordings, featured some of their most focused and inspired tracks to date. Shortly after its release, Albertini started recording new material that was deemed lost after a computer meltdown, but was eventually recovered and released as A Dot Running For the Dust - The Lost Sessions in early 2015. It will be followed by Helvetia’s new album, Dromomania, due out October 2nd on Joyful Noise.

“Dromomania” evokes the simplicity of ‘70s Kinks, combined with a good dose of Captain Beefheart and the randomness of The Residents. Third-wave hardcore influences meld with elements of Neu-like trance rock; Meat Puppets and Elevator to Hell come together on tracks like “Bermuda” and “Radio Shower.” Dromomania is a condition of wandering with no notice of intent nor memory of getting to where you’re going — just when you think you can get comfortable, you’re transported to a different place with a different set of ideals. Dromomania is a vague sense of feeling and dreams a-plenty."

“This insane noisecore quartet from San Antonio, TX have certainly made a name for themselves over the past couple of years in the underground noisecore circuit with an ever growing number of releases, including but not limited to various splits, demos, and EPs.

Bovine Fecal Matter plays an old school kind of noisecore that could be compared to greats such as MEAT SHITS, SEVEN MINUTES OF NAUSEA, and even DECHE-CHARGE to some extent, and at times have a gore-tinged element reminiscent to acts like ANAL BIRTH and early LAST DAYS OF HUMANITY.” - D.D., ETERNAL NIGHTMARE RECORDS.

Rip's music is down-home and down-to-earth like he is, foot-stompin' and barn-burnin' stuff that forces you to recall what music is all about.

A virtuoso of boogie-woogie piano, Rip found his musical calling early in his love of country music and old Rock 'n' Roll records. He started out as a singer, but became so accomplished on the keys that he was in demand as a session player, playing on many of the Rollin' Rock label's rockabilly records. He also recorded his first album, Rock That Rock! for Rollin' Rock and continued to play live concerts. He toured the Far East, the West Coast, Texas and all over California, perfecting his performing skills. 

Rip continued to explore his love of songwriting, and had several of his compositions covered by other artists, including Rockabilly Man, which became the theme song of Legend Ray Campi, and was recorded by England's Firebirds. This song has become a Rock 'n' Roll favorite and is known all over the world."

1916 Biography:
Formed as an acoustic pub act in 2006, 1916 has quickly become the hardest hitting Irish Rock band this side of Dublin city! Steve Ladue’s drums thunder through the music to generate the distinctive backbeat that makes 1916 so easy to rock out to . He has played in several bands over the years and brings his experience to the table as a truly gifted performer.
Chris VanCleve attacks the upright bass with a fury that you have to see to believe. He combines Rockabilly with Irish Rock to make a kickass and in-your-face sound. Jake Publicover can chop down trees with his amazing guitar playing. Seriously. His knowledge of Irish music and penchant for throwing a party help to give 1916 that rich, full bodied sound.
Bill Herring belts out the tunes with a dizzying performance that will leave you wondering where all the whiskey went. His chops as a vocalist and his skill with his trusty Gretsch combine to make a volatile blend of Irish Punk that could make a grizzly bear purr."

Influenced by Television, Unwound, Tortoise, the spirit of the SST catalog, and the unlimited aspects of noise, they craft intricate songs that adapt the sounds of the 90’s underground into a contemporary mixture.

Lifeguard began with bassist Asher Case and drummer Isaac Lowenstein playing and writing music in early 2019. They met guitarist/vocalist Kai Slater a few months later when the two played a festival backing up Chicago band Horsegirl who played with Slater's band Dwaal Troupe. After the show, they began talking and invited Slater to collaborate, resulting in a collection of songs written and performed later that year under the name Lifeguard, which lead to the release of the In Silence EP in February 2020 and the Tin-Man single in March of the same year.

Their debut album Dive was released on October 2nd, 2020. Recorded at Electrical Audio in Chicago by Jeremy Lemos, the album finds the band splitting the difference between their early material and their newfound confidence since the release of their first EP."

Formed in 1994 as a noise rock/noisecore band under the name [b]To Kill Mother[/b], then changed name to [b]Cradlenoise[/b] (1994-1995), and since 1995 until 2003 existed as [b]Rabies Caste[/b].

RABIES CASTE: chronological chain of events

Late 1994: Noisecore duo TO KILL MOTHER and later CRADLENOISE was established by Dale Rabid on drums/vocals & Dave K on guitar, Russian immigrants in Tel-Aviv, Israel. Three tracks demo tape was recorded during the sessions at the 5 on 3 feet rehearsing room. Because of the numerous complaints about the noise playing was forbidden.

Fall 1995: Addition of Russell Bear on bass and converting into RABIES CASTE (Dave K-guitar/vocals, Russell Bear-bass, Dale Rabid-drums/vocals) . Starting off with the first song, Melvins inspired ""I Love My Pig"". First gig on the 11th of November got cancelled because of the Prime Minister murder.

June 1996: 10 tracks demo titled ""Self Portrait Of The Madness"" was taped live at studio in two hours on the 4th of July. Many copies were made and given away/sold at the several shows that followed the recording. The 45 minutes long ""album"" displays heavy-as-fuck hardcore/grunge roots of the band.

September 1996: Entered the studio to record one new song ""Mouthwash"", which was supposed to coincide with a video. The shootings did take place but were never edited, the guy who did it dissapeared but luckily wasn't payed. The recording still remained and it's quite unique. The band has moved forward and began working on a new material, which was now more metallic and somewhat slower.

Summer 1997: ""Children Can Fall Into Bucket And Drown"" 6 songs EP was recorded in the basement on 4 tracks in the intensive heat during that summer. Dale Rabid doesn't do vocals anymore because he's ""busy enough drumming"". With songs such as ""Neon"", ""Goddamn"" and the 10 minutes wall of noise ""Inch"" this was the record to start touring with but the decision was not to release it. The EP was sold on tapes at couple of shows and went back home on a shelve. Despite most of the songs were well known to the regular crowd the record has never been airplayed or put to digital download.

Early 1998: Moving on...RABIES CASTE is busy writing material for their first full lenght album which they intend to self release. A lot of new songs were written and 6 chosen to be on the most interesting recording up to that day. The sessions were sqeduled for June in the same studio where ""Children Can Fall.."" was done and two weeks before the actual recording Pigface Kazzz joins in on second guitar. (He used to be in another hardcore band Ausweis, who have toured with RABIES CASTE a lot around that time and split up early 1998. Dave K used to play in Ausweis on second guitar as well and even contributed to the Ausweis record ""Commintern.com"" on several tracks late '97.) Pigface Kazzz is playing on the new record on 5 songs, except for ""Astronaut/Alien"". The first mix was lost on the computer, second didn't sound right and third has taken a month to get to. ""For The Vomiting Tractor Drivers"" session took two weeks and was mastered and pressed in late August 1998. Self release of 260 copies were sold and sent away to magazines and labels. Pigface Kazzz leaves RABIES CASTE in Fall '98 after shows as a four piece. He cannot fully commit himself to the band and moves away. Replacement didn't follow.

Winter 1999: RABIES CASTE and Infernal Racket Records (PA,USA) agreed to officially release ""For The Vomiting Tractor Drivers"" worldwide. The release is sqeduled for Summer but has been delayed because the factory refused to press CDs due to their severe content (whatever the fuck it means). The press was run in Canada instead and the album was officially released in September 1999. The band is planning to tour but the opportunity only comes when RABIES CASTE are offered a support slot for Liverpool's ""dBh"" early 2000. At that time Dale Rabid was working on some project with some folks, to complete an album. It seems that the lead singer had damaged his vision in bizzare tractor accident two days before the sqeduled recording sessions, which never taken place.

1999-2000: 10 dates UK tour with dBh in April 2000 which was followed by another UK tour with Freebase in November. Meanwhile the band was writing new material for the next release and booked a studio in London for November 2000 with producer Harvey Birrell.

November 2000: 5 days in Southern studio London = 6 tracks ""Let The Soul Out And Cut The Vein"" advanced record. This album eventually found a home at Earache Records early 2001.

May 2001: RABIES CASTE signing a record deal with Earache Records and are heading back to UK to complete 10 tracks for the full lenght ""Let The Soul Out And Cut The Vein"" and a tour with sludge brothers Charger. The record is completed and remixed with Harvey Birrell again at the same studio.

August 2001: ""Let The Soul Out And Cut The Vein"" is sqeduled for European release on 28th of August and 2nd October for USA. Gore/snuff video for the song ""Got It From Blake"" is done and being banned everywhere including the Internet. Album rating: Terrorizer magazine 8/10, Metal Hammer 7/10, Kerrang 4/5, Rock Sound 4.5/5

Fall 2001-Summer 2002: RABIES CASTE are touring UK/Europe in support of the release with Dillinger Escape Plan, Biohazard, Nasum, Candiria and Earthtone9. In November 2001 the band also headlines first in two years Israeli show. Also, the band are forced to cancel the sqeduled appearances at New Jersey and Milwaukee Metalfests due to technical problems. Mid Summer 2002 Russ has temporary been away from the band. Ram_R from NYC grindcore duo bARBARA has filled in for a while. Russ was back to complete the forthcoming November dates.

November 2002: Heading off to the headline tour for the first time in UK/Scotland/Wales.

February 2003: 2 Middle East live dates, first time in few years RABIES CASTE are to play in Jerusalem. Both gigs were quite a success. Metal Hammer magazine came over from the UK to do a live review, but lied and never printed it.

October 2004: It's been 1.5 years of inactivity and there are finally some releases scheduled: split 7"" with buddies in Sourvein and the new RABIES CASTE record. Both releases should be out early 2005. Meanwhile RABIES CASTE have made their mark in the history: ""Sound Of The Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal"" & ""The Book Of Metal"", two books by Ian Christe and Chris Ingham mention Rabies Caste on page 272 & 69. We've made our mark. ""So if I die of O.D. soon, somebody will actually remember me?...."" asked Dale Rabid."

After the breakup of The Time, drummer and percussionist Jellybean Johnson decided to work as a producer, musician, and songwriter throughout his career. He became a long-time associate of Flyte Tyme productions. His first session job was being a musician for Alexander O'Neal's #11 R&B hit ""Innocent"" (produced by The Time bandmates Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis). On this track, he was not only the drummer, but also delivered the guitar solos for the second half of the ten-minute long song. From this point on, he was in-demand as a session guitarist (and drummer/percussionist) for Janet Jackson, Alexander O'Neal, New Edition, and many others. Throughout his career, he has also produced a number of hits for Alexander O'Neal, New Edition and many others. But it wasn't until 1990 when he would co-produce (with Janet Jackson) his biggest hit to date: Janet Jackson's Heavy Metal/Rock inspired #1 smash hit ""Black Cat"". He has also co-produced Mint Condition's entire debut album Meant to Be Mint.

Shadowfax found a wider audience when they signed with [l=Windham Hill Records] in 1982.  Their self-titled second album featured a softer sound, heavy on jazz and world music influences.

Shadowfax won a Grammy Award for the 1988 album ""Folk Songs For A Nuclear Village.""  They also received a Grammy nomination for the 1992 album ""Esperanto.""

Shadowfax' signature sound was largely built around Chuck Greenberg's lyricon and woodwinds.  On September 4, 1995 Greenberg died of a heart attack and the group disbanded.

152680,1702051,14949933,Europe,Soft Machine,Live At The Baked Potato,2020,0.0,12,"['LP', 'Album', 'Limited Edition', 'Numbered']","['Jazz', 'Rock']","['Jazz-Rock', 'Prog Rock']","Soft Machine are an English rock and jazz band from Canterbury formed in mid-1966, named after the novel The Soft Machine by William S. Burroughs.

Australian poet, guitarist, singer, composer and performance artist [a=Daevid Allen] moved to Paris in 1960. Inspired by the emerging 'Beat Generation' of writer's works he'd discovered whilst working in a Melbourne bookshop he moved into a room in Paris's 'Beat Hotel' and spent time around the city's Latin Quarter. There, he rubbed shoulders with [a=Terry Riley] and [a=William S. Burroughs], gaining free access to the area's jazz clubs. Influenced by the music philosophies of [a=Sun Ra] he formed the [a=Daevid Allen Trio], a free-jazz outfit which performed in Burroughs' theatre pieces based on that writer's novel 'The Ticket That Exploded'. 

In 1961 Allen travelled to Canterbury, England, where he met 16 year-old [a=Robert Wyatt] (who was the son of his landlord). Their mutual interest in jazz resulted in a few gigs, in London in 1963, as the Daevid Allen Trio (with [a=Hugh Hopper] on bass and [a=Mike Ratledge] occasionally guesting on piano). Around the same time, Wyatt formed the [b][a=Wilde Flowers][/b] with the Hopper brothers, Hugh and Brian Hopper, with [a=Kevin Ayers] on vocals.

The impetus behind the formation of [a=Soft Machine] occurred in a meeting of Daevid Allen and Kevin Ayers with Texan millionaire Wes Brunson in Deya, Majorca, on Easter Sunday 1966. Brunson agreed to put up the money for a new band, which allowed the group to buy equipment and rent a rehearsal room near Canterbury. The original line-up consisted of Robert Wyatt on drums and vocals, Mike Ratledge on keyboards, Daevid Allen on guitar and Kevin Ayers on bass and vocals. From May 1966 they gigged as Mister Head (aka Mr Head) and became [b]Soft Machine[/b] in August 1966.

The name was taken from a William S. Burroughs novel 'The Soft Machine' (part of The Nova Trilogy), with agreement from the author. The title The Soft Machine encapsulates the Human Body, and the main theme of the book - as explicitly written in an appendix - concerns how control mechanisms invade the body. One poem, entitled Mens (Man, as in 'human'), by Dutch-American hematologist and poet Leo Vroman starts with the line: ""Man is a soft machine...""

Mike Ratledge says of this : ""... Soft machine was a generic term for the whole of humanity, and we were all soft machines... I guess our basic assumption was that what we liked, everybody else was going to like as well, that we all had things in common, and therefore we all are soft machines, and we were all going to like Soft Machine music. It might have been a false assumption, but I hope it's true"".

In January 1967, the band's first single release, [i][b][m16803][/b][/i], was recorded.. Celebrating its release on February 22nd 1967 the band gave a press conference at The Speakeasy, performing that evening at The Roundhouse as the opening act for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience] - where Hendrix jammed with them on bass. 

Allen recalls their introduction to The Speakeasy by [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], the promoter, producer, founder of the Crawdaddy Club and original manager of both [a=The Yardbirds] and [a=the Rolling Stones]; “He would take us there and ply us with whiskeys on the expense account. We’d meet all the big stars at the time. It was like being at court, only a rock ‘n’ roll court. ‘Cause [a=the Beatles] were there, the Rolling Stones were there – everybody, all the big names, would gather at the Speakeasy at this particular time.” [From the book 'Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous' by Graham Bennett].

Three months later, a collection of demos was recorded at DeLane Lea Studios with producer [a=Giorgio Gomelsky], but not officially released until 1971 as two compilations on the French [l=BYG Records] label. At that time, Soft Machine had already become something of a 'cult' band on the London psychedelic scene, gigging at places like the Zebra Club, The Marquee, The Roundhouse, UFO (Underground Freak Out club) and Middle Earth. Light shows were also developed with Mark Boyle's Sensual Laboratory. On April 29th, 1967, they took part in the '14 Hour Technicolor Dream', an event set up by the underground paper 'International Times', which also featured [a=Pink Floyd], [a=the Move], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Crazy World of Arthur Brown], [a=Tomorrow (2)], [a=Mothers of Invention], [a=Velvet Underground] and artists such as [a=Alan Ginsberg] and [a=Yoko Ono].

During the summer of 1967 the band toured France, performing at psychedelic events along the Cote d’Azur such as [a=Jean-Jacques Lebel]’s “Sunlove Happening” and [l=Eddie Barclay]’s “La Nuit Pschedelique”. For three weeks they provided daily musical “transmissions hallucinatoires” for wildly popular performances of “Le Désir Attrapé par la Queue”, a Pablo Picasso play produced by Lebel at the Festival de la Libre Expression outside Saint-Tropez. A legendary performance of “Do It Again” helped Soft Machine to make an enormous impression in France and, by the end of the Summer of Love, they became the favorite band of the French avant-garde. 

On the way back Daevid Allen was refused re-entry to England and stayed in France, moving on to various projects before forming [a=Gong] two years later, while Robert Wyatt, Mike Ratledge and Kevin Ayers decided to carry on Soft Machine as a trio.

In February 1968, Soft Machine embarked on a three month US tour (opening for the [a=Jimi Hendrix Experience]), recording their first album during their touring schedule in New York in four days in April 1968, with production handled by Tom Wilson and former [a=Animals] bassist and Hendrix producer [a=Chas Chandler]. Although quickly made and not particularly well-recorded, the band's eponymous album [i][b][m=16766][/b][/i] (1968) is now considered a classic of the extraordinarily creative post-psychedelic and pre-progressive period of the late 1960's.

The band split up in December 1968, re-formed in February 1969 and carried on until the late 1970's through many line-up changes and leaving no original member onboard. It re-formed briefly in 1980 and 1984. Robert Wyatt formed [b][a=Matching Mole][/b] in October 1971. ""Matching Mole"" is a clever mis-pronounciation of ""La Machine Molle"", the French title of William Burroughs' novel ""The Soft Machine"".

338297,1841473,16227514,Europe,The Nels Cline Singers,Share The Wealth,2020,78.72,10,['Album'],"['Jazz', 'Rock']","['Contemporary Jazz', 'Jazz-Rock', 'Free Improvisation']","The Nels Cline Singers are a trio of avant-assassins led by guitarist Nels Cline. Formed in 2001, The Singers have released 4 albums on Cryptogramophone that combine wide-ranging compositions with group improvisations, and run the gamut between delicate lyricism, and skull-crunching flights of fancy. Since joining the critically acclaimed rock group Wilco in 2004, Nels Cline has emerged as one of the most respected and unclassifiable musicians active today – memorably described by Jazz Times as “the world’s most dangerous guitarist” and by New York Times writer/bestselling author David Carr (Night of the Gun) as “one of the best guitarists in any genre.”

Ironically, Cline formed the Singers at the urging of versatile drummer Scott Amendola, a New Jersey-born Black Sabbath and Ornette Coleman acolyte who had gained prominence in San Francisco’s’ heady, dot-com era music scene of the early 90s though his collaborations with guitarist Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Philip Greenlief. It was Greenlief who introduced Cline to Amendola, who then brought in Colorado native Devin Hoff, a young contrabassist equally at ease with Norwegian Black Metal as he was with jazz standards and improvised music.

What emerged was a impeccably pedigreed and potently eclectic band of three successive generations of vanguard virtuosos whose buzz has only grown with each subsequent release Instrumentals (2002), The Giant Pin (2004), Draw Breath (2007) and their most recent double-album Initiate (2010). "

Their later music was often categorized as new age.

Shadowfax was formed in Chicago in 1972 as a blues band by saxophonist [a=Chuck Greenberg], guitarist [a=G.E. Stinson] and bassist [a=Phil Maggini].  The band took its name from Gandalf's silvery-grey horse in [a=J.R.R. Tolkien]'s ""Lord of the Rings.""  During the 1970s they moved to a style heavily influenced by progressive rock mixed with elements of world music, folk, jazz and even classical chamber music. Their early music was characterized by very strong guitar work and a definite rock edge.  Their only release in this style was their debut album, ""Watercourse Way"", initially released by [l=Passport Records] in 1976.

Shadowfax found a wider audience when they signed with [l=Windham Hill Records] in 1982.  Their self-titled second album featured a softer sound, heavy on jazz and world music influences.  It reached number 19 on the Billboard jazz chart.  Subsequent Shadowfax albums would reach the top 10 on jazz and new age charts and also chart on the Billboard Hot 200.

Shadowfax won a Grammy Award for the 1988 album ""Folk Songs For A Nuclear Village.""  They also received a Grammy nomination for the 1992 album ""Esperanto.""

Shadowfax' signature sound was largely built around Chuck Greenberg's lyricon and woodwinds.  On September 4, 1995 Greenberg died of a heart attack and the group disbanded.

In addition to Ron, RKB features lead guitarist Dave “DC” Cothern, bassist El Diablo (aka Geno Arce, also a longtime member of Keel and other Ron Keel projects), Jeff “The Rev” Koller on drums and keyboardist Dakota Scott Schmitt (the latter two are both members of the South Dakota Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame). They have been together for four years – starting out as the House Band for a Sioux Falls entertainment complex called Badlands Pawn. During that era, they toured heavily on their own and with Midwest legends Hairball, and backed up other singers like Paul Stanley, Jack Blades, Kip Winger, Mark Slaughter, Don Dokken, and Stephen Pearcy – and for a 2016 Sioux Falls performance they did a set of covers mixed with Megadeth hits with EMP founder David Ellefson.

Those experiences tightened the band into a well-oiled musical machine and cemented their bond as friends. So, when Badlands Pawn went out of business, they chose to stick together and “fight like a band,” hence the inspiration behind the title track of the new album.

 “We’ve been to hell and back together,” Keel confesses. “Everyone in the band sacrificed a lot, leaving their homes, gigs, families and friends to be a part of that. When it folded, this group was too strong to stop, so we renamed it Ron Keel Band and kept doing what we do – kicking ass.” Ron also credits the band and their music with helping him stay strong as his wife Renée battled breast cancer last year. “This album is a monument to our fans and the tough guys in this band…and it’s the most personal musical statement I’ve ever made.”"

It was time, in that historic venue, to pass the spirit to the next generation. It was time to take all the lessons of the past, all their collective experiences, and make something new.
Following that concert, Betts would go on to serve as an opening artist on the Devon Allman Project 2018 world tour, joining Allman each night for a musical tip of the hat to their respective fathers. The year-long trek was the first to pair Allman and Betts, tallying nearly 100 dates across the US and internationally, and increasingly drawing larger audiences with each successive leg.
After a successful year of touring, the sons of Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts officially joined forces to form a new group together. Their first call was to old friend Berry Oakley Jr., son of the Allman Brothers Band’s founding late bassist, Berry Oakley, and floated the idea of joining them. The trio’s musical friendship traces back to The Allman Brothers Band’s 20th anniversary summer tour in 1989 when the three first met, and often sat-in with the Rock-And-Roll Hall of Fame inductee. In November of 2018, they announced the formation of The Allman Betts Band."

(Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.) The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years.

The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.

Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers. Another noteworthy aspect of W&C's sound is the absence of drums.

Formed in late 1986 after BLIND LEGION disbanded some members relocated to California from New York and started jamming with several vocalists. They stuck with Wino (of Obsessed/St. Vitus/Spirit Caravan/etc.) in 88 for a demo now called ""Wino Daze"". Wino left shortly and was replaced for Gary Tocco (Blind Legion singer) and they recorded what would be the supposed first album (now issued on CD by Blood and Iron Records under the name of ""World of Power"" with 2 added songs with the singer after Gary) in 1989. The album never happened since they didn't found a label, so the band released themselves a debut 7""choosing 2 songs off that recording with Gary on vocals. Another singer change and finally in 1991 they get a contract with German cult label Hellhound Records (Vitus, Obsessed, Count Raven, etc.) and have included an exclusive song of the What the Hell compilation. In 93 comes out the first album ""The Evil in You and Me"" with mostly re-recorded old songs with different lyrics. 1995 Hellhound strikes back with their second album ""Save Yourself' and after that the band slowly fades away…another singer change, name change to Vengeance Brothers and inbetween the name changes they record several studio tracks through the late 90s until 2000, which were later reissued by Blood & Iron and Metal Soldiers labels (co-release) under the title ""Bow Down"". In the last 10 years the Wino Daze demo saw releases on CD (self released by band member Eric ""Ike"" Baestlein) and on deluxe vinyl edition by At War with false Noise and the studio albums also were reissued by Shadow Kingdom. The Legacy of Lost Breed lives on!

Over time, the line-up would fluxuate, with Reese leaving, and vocalist Vance Bockis and guitarist Norman Lawson passing through the ranks.  Finally, as a trio consisting of Weinrich (now handling vocals and guitar), Laue, and Flood, the band released their debut 7"", commonly known as ""Sodden Jackal"".  The band made a name for themselves in and around Maryland, even gaining a following in Washington DC's famous hardcore punk scene, and made an appearance on a ""Metal Massacre"" compilation.  Flood was eventually replaced by [a=Ed Gulli] and this line-up recorded a tape together in 1985 but were unable to find anyone to release it.  Faced with a lack of success and label disinterest, the group disbanded shortly afterwards.  However, word of the band reached Saint Vitus, whose singer, [a=Scott Reagers], had announced his departure from the band, and they asked Wino to join.  The Obsessed tape began making the rounds in tape-trading circles and, soon enough, [l=Hellhound Records], Saint Vitus's German record label, offered to release it.  To support its release, Wino put a new version of the band, consisting of drummer [a=Greg Rogers] and bassist [a=Scott Reeder] (who replaced Danny Hood, who was killed in a motorcycle accident shortly after joining the Obsessed), for a tour.  However, after the tour, Wino decided to quit Saint Vitus for reasons that remain a point of contention between Wino and Vitus leader [a=Dave Chandler].  Wino maintained that he received Chandler's blessing for the release of the Obsessed album and subsequent tour but upon returning home was unhappy with the new material Chandler was writing and upset that the band chose [a=Don Dokken] to produce their next album.  Chandler claimed that he was apprehensive about the Obsessed project and that Wino lost interest in Saint Vitus because of it.  In any case, the Obsessed was now Wino's full-time band the group recorded ""Lunar Womb"" for Hellhound in 1991.  Dissatisfied with Hellhound, Wino accepted a record deal with Columbia Records for the band's next album ""The Church Within"", which saw [a=Guy Pinhas] replace Scott Reeder.  However, life on a major label was not much better.  The label pulled promotion for the album just as it was being released and it was a commercial failure.  The band soon split and, for a time, Wino sank into substance abuse.  However, he eventually managed to clean himself up and, after living for a number of years in Los Angeles, returned to Maryland were he fronted [a=Spirit Caravan] and [a=The Hidden Hand] before going solo.  In 1999, Southern Lord Recordings put together an odds-and-ends collection called ""Incarnate"".

In February 2016, Wino announced that his band [a=Spirit Caravan] would be adopting The Obsessed moniker while continuing to play material from both bands' catalogs."

The band have dedicated themselves to boundlessly crafting their own brand of heavy music, cloaked in themes of despair, loss, nonexistence, and seeking truths often left unspoken.  ""I find a certain beauty in depression and darkness. It's as real as it gets, and I have the utmost respect for it."" Moran explained.

Dead Rhetoric said ""Vacant Eyes as a unit understand that you can still be engaging at a plodding pace, and keep building the arrangements in elegance, grace, and sophistication through subtle magnification."", and describes the band's musical range as being ""From slow, sorrowful melodies drenched with emotion, to heavier, more up-tempo movements..."".  Metal Injection featured the band in their Funeral Doom Friday series, describing the band as having “all the hallmarks of funeral doom-type bands like Clouds and Swallow The Sun, yet the melodic sensibilities of bands like Insomnium.""

Dub had asked Kitchens if he'd be interested in helping him start a band since the two had been in other bands together in previous years. Once the guitars were tuned and the drums set up, their journey had started.

The duo started crafting their sound by working on cover of songs by Elder, Electric Wizard, and Thin Lizzy, while simultaneously working on their own heavy tunes. Stone Machine Electric's first show was with Wo Fat and Little Big Horn in Deep Ellum (Dallas, TX) in March of 2010. The band started playing two to three shows a month for the remainder of 2010 at various venues in the Dallas/Fort Worth area in order to develop their chemistry for the music they were working on.

Stone Machine Electric released the live Demo/EP, ""Awash in Feedback"", at the end of 2010, as well as recording a single at Tin Can Records for the song ""Walking Among the Blind"". Awash was greatly received by the local community, and the Fort Worth Weekly's review noted the ""sonic architecture"" as a way to ""see Conan praying to Crom right before a battle"". The Fort Worth Weekly nominated the band in their annual music awards for Best Hardcore Band in 2011, for Best EP in 2012, and for Best Metal Band in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The ""Awash"" demo was also well received abroad by such blogs as The Obelisk, Chybucca Sounds, and Planet Fuzz.

The band continued to play the scene in Dallas and Fort Worth in 2011 and into 2012. In the summer of 2012, Dub and Kitchens went into the studio at Crystal Clear Sound with Kent Stump (Wo Fat) behind the boards to record their first full length album. Their self-titled album was self-released at the beginning of 2013. Once again, this release was well received both locally and abroad by the Fort Worth Weekly, The Obelisk, Sludgelord, Paranoid Hitsophrenic, and others. Stone Machine Electric followed this up with a small tour through south Texas, and continued playing shows in the local scene.

After years of looking for the right bassist, Stone Machine Electric decided to stop looking and focus on the music they could create as a two-piece band. This marked the start of incorporating other techniques and instruments to create the sound they wanted. On top of playing drums and providing vocals, Kitchens added the Theremin and other electronics to his setup. Along with this change, the band has also incorporated improvisation into their arsenal, providing a continuous set when they perform live by drifting from one song into the next. This has transformed the Stone Machine Electric sound from a heavy stoner/doom motif to more of a heavy psych arena.

The band's latest outing, the Garage Tape,is out on cassette now. This release features over 40 minutes of a one-shot live recording improvised in the band's practice space as recorded by Erik Carson of Tin Can Records. Stone Machine Electric are hoping this is one people will want to lose their heads over this new release."

In 1994, the death-metal guitarist Øystein G. Brun started to work on a musical vision, a vision of musical boldness. Having always been fond of melodious atmospherics, he recruited like-minded musicians from Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Arcturus, Immortal, and Ulver with the goal of rupturing the peripheries of what was deemed “traditional” black metal. Thus, the brilliant and sophisticated anomaly that is BORKNAGAR was born.

In 1996, after the release of their first self-titled album on Malicious Records, the band signed with Century Media and released The Olden Domain in 1997. Very much to fans and critics alike and earning them a 1998 European tour supporting In Flames.

In August 1998 they went back to the studio to record The Archaic Course which featured the new members, Jens F. Ryland on guitar and Simen Hestnæs a.k.a. I.C.S. Vortex on vocals (former bassist and backing vocalist for Dimmu Borgir). Following an incredible performance at the 1998 Wacken Open Air Festival, drummer Grim and bassist Kai Lie exited the band before they embarked on their 1998 tour with Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and Krisiun, bringing in Justin Greaves on drums and assigning Vortex to additional duties on bass. In May of 1999, BORKNAGAR (joined by ex-Cradle Of Filth and ex- Dimmu Borgir drummer Nick Barker) pillaged through North America on the now legendary Kings Of Terror Tour with Emperor, Witchery, Peccatum & Divine Empire, adding yet another epic chapter in the band’s career.

BORKNAGAR entered Sweden’s famed Abyss Studios in January 2000 to record the material that would become their fourth album Quintessence, adding to their ranks drummer Asgeir Mickelson and Solefald’s keyboardist Lars A. Nedland. Quintessence was one of the year’s most creatively inspiring extreme metal releases and was nominated for the Norwegian national Alarm prize. Simen Hestnæs relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, and the Swede Vintersorg joined the band. Erik Tyr Tiwaz (session and touring bassist for Emperor and Satyricon) was invited to contribute his unique talents while Lars continued to diligently divide his time between Solefald and BORKNAGAR.

In October 2001, one of BORKNAGAR`s best selling records, Empiricism, was released. The album was nominated for two prestigious awards in Norway, the National Grammy Award and again the Alarm prize. In 2004 BORKNAGAR finished the 6th album EPIC. Prior to the recording of the album Jens F.
Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The album turned out to be one of the most ambitious albums the band had done, an album where the horizon and the sky was barely the limit. The album entered the national charts in Norway and received a great response
worldwide. In 2006, BORKNAGAR did the last record Origin for their long-time label Century Media Records. This album was recorded entirely acoustic and contrary to the predecessor, this album was all about getting back to the very basics in BORKNAGARs musical universe. The album marked an end
of a musical journey. As a musical testimony of the years that passed, Century Media Records released a “best of” CD with a suitable title For the Elements 1996-2006 in 2008.

In 2008, as the deal with Century Media Records was fulfilled, BORKNAGAR signed a deal with Norway’s INDIE RECORDINGS. Jens F. Ryland and Erik Tyr Tiwaz rejoined the ranks of BORKNAGAR. Shortly after, due to different musical ideas and goals, long time drummer Asgeir Mickelson decided
to leave the band. A few months after his departure, drummer David Kinkade (ex- Malevolent Creation, Arsis, Divine Empire) joined the band fulltime.

In 2010, Borknagar released Universal featuring a guest appearance by I.C.S. Vortex on the track “My Domain”. The album was highly acclaimed worldwide and earned the band very good reviews in important magazines like Metal Hammer, Rock Hard and Scream Magazine. Soon after, Borknagar
and Erik Tiwaz mutually parted ways and it was announced that I.C.S. Vortex would return to the band for live dates. I.C.S is now a full time member of the band, handling bass and vocals aside with Vintersorg.

In early 2011, Borknagar reunited with their long partners in crime and signed a 3 album deal with Century Media Records.

There’s this guy named Eric Crugnale.  You can call him Crug-nally, or Cruñale or possibly even Crug-nail, but not Crug-a-nagel.  Anyway, he writes songs.  He can also sing and play the guitar.  He knows how to do other stuff too, but that’s a topic for another bio.  Back in the day, he was in a band named The Rockefellers where he wrote songs, played guitar and sang as those were the things he’d be most likely to do in a band.  They had some fun, made some records, played some shows, exchanged some moving parts and eventually disbanded with Eric deciding to chill out for a few years.  But the lore of the sea beckoned him back, and he eventually decided to build a home studio, and through some other fortuitous events, found himself connected with some great musicians that could tolerate him and help him realize some of his more recent musical inspirations.  This lead to his first solo release, Carol Was Here in late 2010.  The album received rave reviews on the Power Pop circuit making several “best of” lists for the year, earning a respectable amount of radio play, drawing songwriter comparisons to Bacharach, McCartney and Wilson and generating enough sales to pay for the paper this bio is written on.  The digital-only release Under the Cushions followed in 2012.  Eric eventually returned to the studio to work on the follow up album, the latest and greatest Time Kills.  If you don’t blink too frequently, you may catch him around NY performing his own songs, making a guest appearance at a NYRMA event, playing guitar in a friend's band or picking up his dry cleaning on Saturday mornings.

He never learned to read music but became a professional musician in 2002 (age 25). He received a Masters degree in Audio Production from the University of Westminster, London (UK), although he never completed a Bachelors degree. His musical range has covered Soul/R&B, Jazz, Funk, House (Soulful/Deep), Broken Beat, Instrumental Ballads, Rock, Alternative, Bossa Nova, Samba, Afrobeat/house, and much more as he loves to explore various genres.

Ahmed has been featured on various independent artist albums and international compilations (both independent and major label distributed) for his original, cover, and remix work. Up-and-coming as well as established artists from around the globe, unsolicited, have sought him to produce music for their projects, and he has even had his music chosen by Academy Award-winning director [b]Spike Lee[/b] for his Netflix series ""She's Gotta Have It"" (""We Rep Brooklyn"" featured in Season 1, Episode 2).

Unsigned and totally independent, and certainly follows the path that he creates as a self-taught and self-styled artist. Whether you need music to enjoy for a quiet night inside curled up with a good book or romantic company,  sweating it out during a gym workout or on a club dance floor (if your covid-19 restrictions aren't strict where you are), or driving out on the road and need something to jam to, or need music with a conscious message to relate to as well as inspire your personal philosophies...whatever your vibe may be, Ahmed Sirour may certainly have the right formula for what you need! He is, quite simply, an artistic force and a musical chameleon to listen to and experience!

Born in Lubbock and raised in the country outside of a town called Paducah, Grady Spencer’s roots dig deep into Texas soil. By day, Spencer is a superintendent for a commercial construction company. By any other time, he’s songwriter and front-man of Grady Spencer & The Work. 
The Work originally formed in 2013 on the stage of Paradox Church in Fort Worth, Texas. Drummer Blake Sager was joined by bassist Johnny Hatcher in 2016, followed by guitarist Tyler Martin in 2018.
The Work’s music reflects its members: honest, good-timing, with a nod to blue-collar roots.
In 2013, the band recorded and self-produced its first album at 1916 Studios in Kyle, Texas. Sleep featured Spencer and Trevor Powell on guitar and vocals, Blake Atwell on guitar, Sager on drums, and Josh Brandenburg on bass. The album was released that same year and was the band’s first introduction to the Fort Worth music scene. “Things to Do” was eventually picked up by the Fort Worth Visitors Bureau via Tom Martens, and in 2017 the city sent Spencer and The Work to Niles City Sound to rerecord and release the track as a single.
Sophomore record The Line Between was primarily tracked at January Sound in Dallas, Texas. The band worked with Magnolia Records and released the album in 2016. Spencer’s vocals and guitar were once again accompanied by Powell on guitar and Sager on drums, with Steve Moore on bass, producer Ryan Tharp on guitar, and Cody Culberson singing harmonies. This album carried the band beyond Fort Worth city limits—a following started to crop up across the state and numbers rose on streaming platforms, catapulting The Work to their next album.
Celebrate, The Work’s most recent album, was recorded with Niles City Sound in Fort Worth, Texas in 2018. This time Spencer was joined by Hatcher on bass and vocals, Martin and producer Austin Jenkins on guitar, and Sager on drums.

After the live shows, the 'experiments' that were taped in the studio started to sound like something that should be not only recorded but also heard and appreciated.
There is no real theme that needed to be followed during recordings, but instead, a true evolution of sounds and appreciation for all types of music.
Songs recorded were meant not to grow old and stale but to give an impression of true feeling and spirit.
Memories of sitting around with friends in awe at the sound of ""The Chameleons"" and ""The Sun & The Moon"" was a true inspiration of getting this unique sound back out there.
""A Long Way From Home"" was worked on between concerts in 2006 and on into 2007.
The project is both original and diverse, bringing many cultures and influences together as one.

Led by guitarist/vocalist Jessica Boudreaux, the Cannibals initially cut their teeth on the local Portland circuit, sharing the stage and receiving encouragement from peers including The Thermals.  Along the way, they released a pair of fantastic full-lengths -- 2013’s No Makeup and 2015’s Show Us Your Mind — on their own label, New Moss Records.  Show Us Your Mind appeared on NPR’s Sound Opinions Best of list in 2015.  The band has since spent an unhealthy amount of time on the road, earning accolades and adding plenty of fresh converts to their highly-charged, no frills attack.

It seemed only logical that when the band decided to sign to a label, they chose Kill Rock Stars, which has a long history of putting out fearless, female-led bands like Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney.  Their most recent release, Full Of It, is the band’s defining statement to date.  Recorded with producer Chris Woodhouse (Thee Oh Sees, Wild Flag), the LP is one of those massive leaps forward that every band hopes to achieve at least once in their career.  Aided by rhythm guitarist Marc Swart, drummer Devon Shirley and bassist Jenny Logan, the 11 songs spark that perfect mix of snotty attitude, unbounded energy, and window rattling volume. 

Since the band's formation they've had the opportunity to play with some their musical heroes, including: Guided By Voices, Mudhoney, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, and The War on Drugs. They've toured the country with The Thermals and CHVRCHES as well as played some major festivals including Sasquatch, Project Pabst and Riot Fest."

His unique voice, spanning four octaves, quickly launched him to semi-celebrity. After playing with experimental guitarist Gary Lucas in his band [a1263938], he released his first album Grace in 1994. Initial sales were slow but the album quickly received critical acclaim and appreciation from other musicians (among them Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney). Just before recordings began for his second album which was to be called My Sweetheart The Drunk, Buckley drowned in the Wolf River in Memphis, Tennessee, aged 30.

After Buckley's death some of the demo recordings for his second album were released on Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk. Early session work recorded in February 1993 was officially released in 2016 and 2019, and several albums composed of live recordings have also been released, along with a DVD of a live performance in Chicago. Fun fact: before breaking through Jeff Buckley had worked for 6 years as a receptionist at Magic Hotel in Los Angeles, California, USA."

He became further discouraged from the industry after being kicked out his first band because of his lack of vocal ability. As a college student, he began to struggle with manic depression, anxiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. After spending days in bed at a time and flunking out of school, he found himself too afraid to ask for help for fear of the judgement of others. In November of 2015, he attempted suicide. Segura penned the lyrics to Let It Burn on a napkin from his hospital bed, a song that would be released on the band’s debut E.P. Caroline. That experience gave him the drive to finally take his pursuit of music seriously with a strong desire to write music that would help combat mental illness stigma and help others struggling to know they are not alone. After many attempts at getting a band together the final lineup was completed with Jake Segura on vocals, Matt Duffney and Kooper Hanosky on guitar, Wonitta on Bass, and Tyler Nichols on drums. The band name Citizen Soldier is the band’s attempt to personify the battles waged inside and the band’s goal to shine a light on the everyday struggles of those who feel overlooked and unappreciated. New to the Salt Lake City scene in early 2017, Citizen Soldier is in its infancy but working relentlessly to make a name for themselves.
Since Citizen Soldier’s debut in 2017, the Salt Lake City-based music group has been all about honoring those who fight battles every day that others dismiss or judge them for. Those battling mental illness, abuse, stigmatization, and being ostracised have embraced their music as a representation of their own stories and struggles. As the community has grown and word has spread, many have found a refuge of survivors to share in their pain."

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

Since late 2005, HTH have released 7 Albums, 2 EP's, 1 B-Sides Compilation, and, here on Bandcamp, some other weird releases and bootlegs available too cuz we know you like to go deep.
Hallelujah The Hills have been releasing critically acclaimed albums and touring the U.S. since 2007. Described by Spin as “criminally underappreciated” and lauded by Pitchfork for their “fist pumping anthems,” they’ve been declared “Boston legends” in their hometown and as having a “cult following” by Stereogum. The band released their first two albums on Misra Records, assisted Titus Andronicus in recording their breakout album The Monitor, and are one of the only bands to have ever toured with The Silver Jews. Their sound was creatively explained as “the kind of punk rock you’d expect on stage at the roadhouse from ‘Twin Peaks’” in The Boston Herald. Others go further, with Aquarium Drunkard noting “few do it with the style and imagination of Hallelujah the Hills” and Captain’s Dead boldly publishing that they “without a doubt they are one of the greatest bands currently making music.”
Band founder and songwriter Ryan H. Walsh’s debut book, Astral Weeks: A Secret History of 1968 (Penguin Press), received rave reviews from The New Yorker, The Guardian, Rolling Stone, and was a New York Times end-of-year Critics’ Pick in 2018. I’m You, the seventh full-length album from Hallelujah The Hills, was written in the months after the book’s release (even incorporating Astral Weeks’ flute player John Payne into the band for the achingly dreamy song “It Still Floors Me”). Kicking off the record with these mirror-plated lyrics, “Hello I am the person singing this song / and if you think that might be you, well I guess you might not be wrong,” I’m You attempts to erase the border between performer and listener, singer and audience, band and fans. The album digs so deep into the concept of self-identity that, by the time the final song ends, you might just feel like me. If there was a Venn diagram featuring these two overlapping circles—wildly triumphant and overwhelming melancholy—the overlap zone would be where I’m You lives. Now entering their 14th year as a band, with a lineup and live show as exciting as ever, Hallelujah The Hills return with their most unified statement yet.
This band is named after a 1963 film by Adolfas Mekas."

This changed in December 2016 when [a259284] officially became the second member of the band. Nine Inch Nails straddles a wide range of many styles of rock music and other genres that require an electronic sound, which can often cause drastic changes in sound from album to album. However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band. In 2020, Nine Inch Nails was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame."

The band's name started as a joke. One night in the '90s, when they were in their early 20s, Hughes and Homme were in the back of a ""zombie green"" VW van with the license plate ""DOOMED,"" and teasing their friend Cole Loo, a genuine death-metal devotee. Hughes demanded proof that the bleak subgenre was legit, and kept asking to hear something from ""The [a255680] of death metal,"" as if a ""peaceful, easy feeling"" could exist within the speediest, darkest corner of heavy metal.

Upon waking up the next day the boys started wondering what that would actually sound like, and the rest is Eagle Of Death Metal-history
The first incarnation of the Eagles of Death Metal appeared in 1998 on Vol. 4 of Homme's Desert Sessions recordings, with Loo himself (credited as ""Loo Balls"") howling an appropriate Darth Vader death-metal vocal. 

The guys gave themselves other names in this band, Jesse Hughes is Jesse ""The Devil"" Hughes, Josh Homme is [a996925] (or [a1291272]) and Tim Vanhamel is Timmy Tipover VanHamel.

The band's concert at [l=Le Bataclan] in Paris on 13 November 2015 was one of the eight targets for a series of terrorist attacks. While the band was playing on stage three terrorists started shooting and bombing the crowd and at least 89 people were killed. The band members escaped the attack. [a=Deftones] was also on the site, they were to play in the same venue for three days from 14 to 16 November. They escaped too.

Jacob reached out to Jonathan back in July, with an idea and concept never before seen or done in Tucson. A fusion of hardcore passionate hip hop lyrics, blended with high energy, aggressive metal tones and rhythms. The one thing missing was a band to make it all come together. Using his deep connections in the Tucson metal scene, Jonathan reached out to a young talented group of musicians to finalize this new super group. Guitarists Lawrence McIntyre & Jesse Espich team up with drummer James Ringstrom, and bassist Alex Parra to provide a unique, yet marketable sound to accompany Jonathan’s wide vocal range and dynamic melodies, as well as Jacob’s gritty yet clever rhymes and distinct voice. Their debut single “Strength Through Struggle” has done amazing numbers, and is available on all major digital music outlets. The band released their follow up single and very first music video “Voices” on their YouTube channel Friday January 15, 2016. The band then followed up with their first studio recorded EP “Sex Is Power”, which made an immediate impact charting as high as #8 on Itunes for new releases for the Rock Genre, and stayed at #1 on Amazon for new alternative metal release for the first 2 weeks.

But Great Wide Nothing turns many of these tropes on their head, infusing prog with emotional immediacy and the vital energy of the rock underground. This gritty, decidedly more down-to-earth approach yields something more akin to a kind of retrofuturist punk than the fantastical escapism & esoteric musings of the genre’s 70’s forebears.

A staple of the Atlanta music scene, Great Wide Nothing - comprising bassist/frontman and primary songwriter Daniel Graham, keyboardist Dylan Porper and drummer Jeff Matthews - has spent nearly a decade in the trenches, gradually amassing a cult following with their expansive, wide-screen arrangements and pop-friendly hooks, counterbalanced by bombastic, balls-out musicianship and earnest, often existential and socio-politically minded lyrics.

Growing up in Mamaroneck, New York, high school memories are “driving to the Bronx at lunch time for bags of crappy pot sprayed with hairspray to make it seem more bud-like.” He left that all behind in order to study philosophy at Plymouth State College. Quitting after two years, he traveled around the U.S., hitting 42 of the 50 states. He moved into Portsmouth in 1987, resuming his studies at UNH while enjoying public transportation (though he had a car) as it “provided a lot of fodder for stories because freaky people take the bus,” and graduated with his philosophy degree in 1989.
Between 1988 and the birth of his record label Two Ton Santa, Guy was in the bands Fancy Pants, Toast, Size of Guam, The Driveways, Up-a-Tree, Beekeeper, The Pants, Bob & Guy, and The Crotch Wax Menace, “and probably some others I’m forgetting as well,” he guesses.
Sometimes, it was a one- or two-gig existence for the band, sometimes not. Sometimes, it was just a matter of trading musicians in and out of bands because everyone was connected to the same people and places. He played with the country band The Buckets, now based out of San Francisco, and comprised of Ray Halliday, Mary Lou Lord and Carrie Bradley. He headed up Two Ton Santa (the band, not the label), a two bass, drums and guitar ensemble with one singer. Guy’s band Milk of Magnesia, “a psychedelic band, almost,” opened their first show at The Rat with a faux imbibing of magnesia milk, inspiring audience members to volunteer their own drinking efforts, only they swallowed the real thing, which Guy seems to think they enjoyed quite a bit.

More than just a band, the Seattle-based rock ‘n’ roll group, Suitcase, is at the center of a musical family. Born of musical companionship and often found in the comfy confines of the historic Earwig Studio in the city’s Wallingford neighborhood, the group’s steady momentum is fueled by the energy it’s provided by fans, friends and kinfolk alike. Earwig, which has been home to many an act looking to cut a standout record, buoys the group as a home base, the center of a network of support and song.
Suitcase, which released its breakout record, Lisabuela, in 2001, subsequently performed two coveted sessions on the famed radio station, KEXP, playing the Audioasis show with KEXP mainstay host, DJ John Richards, along with a one-hour set on The Live Room. The band also caught the attention of R.E.M. guitarist, Peter Buck, who praised the “really good” group in an interview with The Big Takeover (issue #43), saying, “Geez, I haven’t seen a band that was unheralded in a long time that I liked.”
In 2017, the group re-formed after an invitation to play the popular Emerald City music festival, Upstream. Original co-founders Don Farwell (owner of Earwig) and Ed Otto added Clint Hoyler on bass and Joe Patterson on drums. Together, they recorded a new record, Come Back. Full of introspective lyrics and honeycomb hooks, the album is set for a 2019 vinyl release. After playing prominent Emerald City stages like the Crocodile and the Tractor in the 90s and early 2000s, the band is back for more. Why? Because family is forever.

By virtue of experimentation, a multimedia vision, and an energetic delivery, FUTURIST creates a wall of sound that ignites audiences with their own style and modern mythology. With appeal for both lovers of space-age & vintage, FUTURIST has been likened to the visions of Flaming Lips, The Shins, My Morning Jacket, and Spoon. The band is known for its associations with folk-lore and psychedelia, permeating the group's instrumentation, effects, and composition. 

During the extended break following the release of War Is Yesterday, FUTURIST have undergone some substantive changes in their overall aesthetic & collaborators. Departing from their light-hearted, indie folk-rock sounds from their debut, the band have clearly developed some deeper and more nuanced styles that are featured throughout their sophomore record, Omens. Living truer to form, the album is more technologically ambitious, through tracks such as “Slow Motion,” “Bad Air, Still Water,” & the harrowing and experimental “Harakiri,"" FUTURIST have embraced their modern tools to create a hybrid sound, both classic and forward-moving. Peel’s lyrics on songs such as “Olive Mountain,” “Crazy Eights,” & the symphonic “Behold! (Lullaby for the End of Days)” all touch upon the modern malaise & compulsive outrage that plagues an era of instant gratification and nonstop news cycles. All the while the childlike rock anthem “Born on Fire” or the punch-drunk “All I Ever Wanted” prove that the band has not lost touch with their optimistic roots.

""To simply describe it as psychedelic doesn’t do Futurist justice, as they expertly mix genres and layer track upon track of intricate melodies to create a lush soundscape that engulfs the listener. There aren’t too many bands or artists creating in such a free manner these days, free from concern or time limits, unaffected by the outside. When you combine that level of purity with impressive musicianship and a shared desire to escape or create escapism for an audience, the results can be superb. Enter Futurist, a band truly intent on building that kind of sound and experience for their listeners.""

- BuzzMusic

“Futurist’s lyrics wouldn’t be out of place in a tarot deck, but they’re not entirely detached from reality; at the core of the music is a clear yearning for closure, likely of a romantic nature. As such, the band’s ability to bridge the gap between the tangible and the transcendental endows their music with a unique magical realism, and promises more esoteric imagery on their forthcoming sophomore effort, Omens.”

“Futurist have embraced their modern tools to create a hybrid sound that is both traditional and forward-looking.”

The debut album is 15 years in the making. Songwriting began in 2003, and recording began in 2013. Initially, the idea was to track a few songs to listen to personally. The project snowballed into an 19 song, 97 minute musical exploration. Disparate genres have been juxtaposed into one cohesive whole with one main element in common: the singular songwriter/performer.

A very special private Digital Release Listening Party and Live Event was held on 12/21/19. Many people came and were treated to free booze, free food, an album art gallery, and a live solo interpretation of select songs from the album. A live band is currently being assembled and trained to bring this behemoth to life as accurately as possible.

March 1st - March 31st, 2021, a Crowdfunding campaign ensued to finance the manufacturing of CD and Vinyl. Physical copies of the CD were made available 10/1/21. Vinyl pressings were made available 7/1/22 after many unforeseen setbacks. They do, however, look gorgeous and sound great. With the state of Live Music still a giant question mark, it's hard to say whether the Vinyl will get a proper release show any time soon.

There are currently 3 ways to stay up to date with developing information: the official website www.TheFiresideWake.com, the official Facebook Page, and the email list (be sure to sign up from the home page)."

After a hugely successful US tour performing music that ran the gamut from original electro-free-jazz improvisations, driving new-rock anthems and covers from The Stooges and Watt’s first punk rock opera “Contemplating the Engine Room”, mssv has proved a fearless band.

Featuring live electronic processing by both Baggetta and Hodges, as well as Watt’s relentlessly driving bass and vocals, mssv not only shows what it means to be a band in the modern post-genre landscape, but is well on their way to defining it."""

Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12"" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut ""[m=7612],"" in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12"" Singles, including ""[m=213065],"" which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band's most popular songs.

Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry's second album ""[m=16563],"" was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen's interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry's third album, ""[m=7643],"" (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry's sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following ""[m=7332],"" (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry's breakthrough album, ""[m=7376],"" (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records ""[m=7396],"" (1996), and ""[m=7510],"" (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled ""[m=292713],"" (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].

In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released ""[m=7543],"". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for ""[m=16549]."" After the 2004 ""Evil Doer Tour,"" there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released ""[m=16269],"" which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, ""[m=16284],"" in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled ""[m=7414],"" in 2008. 

Despite Jourgensen's claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled ""[m=493113]."" Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, ""[m=422618],"" in 2012 and ""[m=595839],"" in 2013. Scaccia's death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled ""AmeriKKKant."""

Their first release was the 'B-Movie Queens' split EP with Plinky (Plinky's only release). Read was replaced by Lindeman, and this lineup released two EPs, 'Mayhem On The High Seas' (1999) and 'The Invasion From Within!' (2001). Plink left and was replaced by Mike Griffen, while Sparks left and was not replaced.

Tsunami Bomb signed to Kung Fu Records and released their first album, 'The Ultimate Escape' (2002).

All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

As wounded and mutilated souls suffering curses unfathomable, death was their eternal verdict. Once submitting to The Reanimator as their Master, inviting The Ghost to indwell within them, and electing to die to themselves, the zombie slaves escaped the clutches of the grave.

Now, these devil's rejects arm themselves with sonic, vibratory executions and images of horrific realities, bringing an onslaught of sound and warning that will ring into eternity. Rest assured, you will be afraid. You will be very afraid.

There’s nothing more terrifying than the unknown. Grave Robber is the one band that can hold your hand on a decidedly horrifying romp, leading you safely to the other side.

Heed the call of Grave Robber. Die and escape the grave, or die eternally."

The name ""Craig's Brother"" was bassist Scott's calling name in school, where his older brother, Craig Hrapoff, was a popular jock. It was picked at whim for the sake of printing on flyers and stuck. 
Being christians, albeit not in their agenda, they were signed to christian label Tooth & Nail, but never managed to see eye to eye with the label's staff, philosophies and business models, repeatedly clashing over expenditures and offenses taken by the Family bookstore outlets over the band's lyrics and perceived image. In 1999, after achieving modest success with their major label debut ""Homecoming"" the year before, guitarists Andy & Adam both left the band and were replaced by Ryan Key and Dan McLintock. 
After touring for a while, Ryan went back home to Jacksonville and joined Yellowcard whereas Dan would stick around long enough to write and record their sophomore album ""Lost at Sea"" in 2000 before also returning to Jacksonville to rejoin his old band Inspection 12. Drummer and founder Heath left to get married, and HeyMike!'s Steven Neufield and Juice Cabrera also had brief stints in the group, making for future collaborations between these bands. 
Later in 2000, a photo on the band's website of then-drummer Juice flipping the camera off once again upset the Family outlet, and Craig's Brother was finally dropped from Tooth & Nail, their already finished new album remaining unreleased for over a year until it was finally printed and distributed scarcely in 2001. Without any promotion, sales were expectedly slow, and Craig's Brother soon disbanded as members kept dropping off to pursue other goals. 

Around christmas 2003, they announced they were reuniting, with the basic lineup that had stuck with the band for the longest time; Ted Bond, Scott Hrapoff and Heath Konkel. An EP was released through former Yellowcard-member Benjamin Harper's label Takeover Rock. At this point, the bandmember were all busy with their family lives and jobs, in and around the Santa Cruz area. As lead singer and songwriter Ted himself took up the role of rythm guitarist, they took their time and tried out a couple of candidates for the lead guitarist role until Glade Wilson joined the band in 2007. Work began on their third album, this time without the help of a record label but instead financing the entire project themselves through sales and their own funds, in collaboration with former guitarist and songwriter Andy Snyder. The album ""The Insidious Lie"" was finished and streamed for free on christmas day 2010, then released digitally in it's entirity in early 2011.

Founder and Lead Vocalist Charlie Harper was playing in R&B and pub rock groups before being influenced by bands like The Damned to turn to punk. 

The band initially started in 1976 as ""The Subversives"" with singer Charlie Harper. When the band line-up was based around Harper's growling Cockney vocals with Nicky Garratt on Guitar, Paul Slack on Bass and a variety of drummers they became the ""U.K. subversives"", later shortened to ""U.K. Subs"". Although adopting punk stylings, the bands work was still heavily influenced by R&B, albeit played fast. Their sound was most similar to Sham 69 or The Angelic Upstarts, although without the skinhead following

Whilst never having a big hit, several singles made the lower reaches of the Top 30 in the late 70s,  including ""Stranglehold"", ""Tomorrow's Girls"", a cover of The Zombies classic ""She's Not There""  and ""Warhead"". The first two studio LPs ""Another Kind of Blues"" and ""Brand New Age"" also made the lower reaches of the album charts.

In 1983 Nicky Garratt left the band along with bass player Alvin Gibbs and then drummer Kim Wylie leaving Charlie Harper to recruit a whole new band.

Garratt would come back in and out of the line-up over the following 25 years whilst Charlie carried on touring and recording with an almost ever changing line-up.

The UK Subs are the only band to record an album for every letter of the alphabet, in order, reaching Z (Ziezo) in 2016."
17479,58436,501536,US,Bad Religion,The Empire Strikes First,2004,0.0,14,"['LP', 'Album']",['Rock'],['Punk'],"Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.  In 2013, Greg Hetson stopped touring with the group due to undisclosed personal issues.  Guitarist Mike Dimkich stepped into fill the role and in early 2014, it was announced that Hetson had left the group and Dimkich would be a permanent member.  In the fall of 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman left the group and joined [a=Avenged Sevenfold].  He was replaced by Jamie Miller."

The band was re-launched in 2015 by some of the original members and has since released one studio album on Alternative Tentacles.

Tsunami Bomb was formed in 1998 by bassist Dominic Davi and singer Kristin McRory (both ex-[a=Headboard]), with keyboardist/backing vocalist Oobliette Sparks and guitarist Tim Chaddick. Gabe Lindeman played drums with them but could not commit to joining the band permanently. McRory and Chaddick left later that year, and by early 1999 the lineup was rounded out with the addition of singer Emily Whitehurst (aka Agent M) and guitarist Brian Plink (both ex-[a=Plinky]), with drummer Robert Read. Their first release was the 'B-Movie Queens' split EP with Plinky (Plinky's only release). Read was replaced by Lindeman, and this lineup released two EPs, 'Mayhem On The High Seas' (1999) and 'The Invasion From Within!' (2001). Plink left and was replaced by Mike Griffen, while Sparks left and was not replaced.

Tsunami Bomb signed to Kung Fu Records and released their first album, 'The Ultimate Escape' (2002). Davi was asked to leave the band (he went on to [a=Love Equals Death]) and was replaced by Matt McKenzie. This lineup released 'The Definitive Act' (2004). Griffen left and was replaced by Jay Northington, but Tsunami Bomb broke up in 2005. Whitehurst and McKenzie formed [a=The Action Design], while Lindeman and Northington formed [a=Nothington].

In 2015, Davi, Sparks, Lindeman, and Plink re-formed Tsunami Bomb with new singer Kate Jacobi to support the release of 'Trust No One', a compilation of their early EPs. Plink left in 2016, and Chris LaForge filled in until permanent guitarist Andy Pohl joined.

They released three EPs before losing their keyboardist/backing vocalist, then signed to Kung Fu Records and released two studio albums with additional lineup changes before breaking up in 2005. The band was re-launched in 2015 by some of the original members and has since released one studio album on Alternative Tentacles.

Tsunami Bomb was formed in 1998 by bassist Dominic Davi and singer Kristin McRory (both ex-[a=Headboard]), with keyboardist/backing vocalist Oobliette Sparks and guitarist Tim Chaddick. Gabe Lindeman played drums with them but could not commit to joining the band permanently. McRory and Chaddick left later that year, and by early 1999 the lineup was rounded out with the addition of singer Emily Whitehurst (aka Agent M) and guitarist Brian Plink (both ex-[a=Plinky]), with drummer Robert Read. Their first release was the 'B-Movie Queens' split EP with Plinky (Plinky's only release). Read was replaced by Lindeman, and this lineup released two EPs, 'Mayhem On The High Seas' (1999) and 'The Invasion From Within!' (2001). Plink left and was replaced by Mike Griffen, while Sparks left and was not replaced.

Tsunami Bomb signed to Kung Fu Records and released their first album, 'The Ultimate Escape' (2002). Davi was asked to leave the band (he went on to [a=Love Equals Death]) and was replaced by Matt McKenzie. This lineup released 'The Definitive Act' (2004). Griffen left and was replaced by Jay Northington, but Tsunami Bomb broke up in 2005. Whitehurst and McKenzie formed [a=The Action Design], while Lindeman and Northington formed [a=Nothington].

In 2015, Davi, Sparks, Lindeman, and Plink re-formed Tsunami Bomb with new singer Kate Jacobi to support the release of 'Trust No One', a compilation of their early EPs. Plink left in 2016, and Chris LaForge filled in until permanent guitarist Andy Pohl joined. The new lineup began releasing new material, and signed to Alternative Tentacles for a new studio album, 'The Spine That Binds' (2019)."

The original lineup consisted of Jack Grisham (vocals), Ron Emory (guitar), Mike Roche (bass), and Todd Barnes (drums).  Starting out as a politically-tinged hardcore punk band, the group moved towards horror themes and are considered by some as an influence on the early deathrock scene.  The original lineup stayed together through 1983, recording 2 EPs and 2 LPs.  Barnes and Grisham departed in '83 and were replaced by Mitch Dean and Joe Wood (the latter of whom was Grisham's brother-in-law at the time).  The Wood and Dean line up continued to record and release music throughout the 80s, shifting towards hard rock.  Emory and Roche eventually dropped out, leaving the band with no original members.  The original lineup reunited for some live gigs in 1991 but were unable to use the T.S.O.L. name since it was now controlled by Wood and Dean.  Wood continued to tour under the T.S.O.L. banner throughout the 1990s, mostly in South America.  In 1999 Emory, Grisham, and Roche regained control of the band name, and have continued to tour and occasionally record ever since.  Barnes died from a brain aneurysm in 1999 after years of addiction issues.

The future of the band was just uncertain. 

Fast forward two years. Despite almost 1000 miles separating Laub and McCumber, they were able to travel back and forth, play more gigs, and write new music in borrowed practice spaces. More years passed, and with the help of newfound bassist Spencer Burnette-McGrath, Friend Of My Youth persevered. Although McCumber still lives in California and Laub and McGrath reside in Oregon, they’ve at last finished recording their debut album entitled ‘Telling’."

Fans have come to say that ""This Year's Comeback isn't a band, they're a party.""

Formed in the summer of 2014, by friends Brian Matthew, Nick Stier, and Ryan Connor, This Year's Comeback took quite a while before finding an identity for itself. However, through many line-up changes and a few genre adjustments, in September of 2016, the band finally released its first demo tracks. Despite this step in the right direction, it wasn't until February of 2017 that an official line-up had finally been set in stone. With the accompaniment of Justin Quintana and bassist, Ken Rapsas, the band was finally ready to move towards much more grandeur projects. 

In June, 2017, TYC released their single, ""Despite The Flood"", less of a demo and more of an aural assault demonstrating the band's DIY capabilities, and raw musical prowess. 

The year following ""Despite The Flood"", 2018, This Year's Comeback released their first full length studio album ""Far From Fine, A Garden State Tragedy"" in 2018, the followup ""Missing Pages"" in 2019, and their ""Douglas Wake"" EP in 2019.

Torching the church and perversions of a rich subculture gone impotent, Will E. Ramone was visited by an other-world being, the Reverend Nicky Bullets, who promised a world of exploding cars and anarcho-mayhem from which his guitar would be the kindling. Having been charged with “the purpose,” the two sent an emissary to the farthest corners of the world seeking the most sinister and battle-ready punk tribes to grant audience and help fill the ranks of this new machine.

Some of the finest combatants the ancient order ever produced would step forward, but in the end none were truly war-ready. One by one they all died… and just when all seemed lost and hopeless, Will E. Ramone’s vigor was rejuvenated by the queen of an underground death squadron who went under the simple alias Merf. She had also been baptized in “the purpose” and together they ventured east of their land, for on the wind was rumor of a percussive god worshipped by rogues and vagabonds alike. Drummer Mike had heard Will E. Ramone’s tales of fire, death, and “the purpose.” It was the opportunity he had been seeking to finally lay waste to all sheep of the western world. 

With a mighty snare strike echoing through the terrain, the thunderous war signal had once again been ignited with their respective instruments forging the mightiest of all tri-forces. Once thought to have been permanently vanquished to a distant New England netherworld, the Reverend Nicky Bullets observed the glowing tri-force illuminating the northern night skies and knew his voice must once again carry forth the message of “the purpose.”

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

Ambro is best known as one half of the noise rock duo [a1241304], who released two critically acclaimed albums, ""Sugarland"" and ""Sunshine"", and shared the stage with the likes of Sonic Youth, Wire, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Zola Jesus. The dissolution of Talk Normal marked a shift in Ambro's writing process. Going forward as Gold Dime, her compositions now veer towards an exploratory sound that is distinctly her own. Her drumming is rhythmically-centered, a reflection of driving West African beats crossed with a blunt industrial throbbing, which serve to both underscore and retreat from classically-influenced orchestrations. Bass lines dance. Guitar riffs in rare tunings purposefully stray from typical rock n' roll conventions. Their urgent squalls gracefully enter and exit, allowing for a permeable tension throughout each of these tracks. Ambro's lead vocals are forceful but can seamlessly alter to a deadpan counterweight - a prominent feature to Gold Dime's cover of the British spoken-word artist Anne Clark's ""All We Have To Be Thankful For"". And for all of the Gold Dime's musical density and elaborate noise, the magic that ensues when Ambro's thunderous vocal style is often foiled by Adam Markiewicz's (The Dreebs, PC Worship) falsetto voice is palpable. Her lyrics are frequently confrontational (""Quota"", ""4 Hours""). But they also speak to the challenges of maintaining our most sacred relationships (as in the case of ""Easy""), as well as confronting the struggles to continue creating when forces seem against us (""Rock"", ""Shut Up"").

The band's first release was 1989's ""Whack & Blite"" 7"" on their own Blackball Records.  The band released 3 LPs and made appearances on different compilations for various independent labels before signing to a major label, DGC, at the end of 1994.  However, their major label debut, ""Dear You"", failed to expand their audience and brought cries of ""sell out"" their punk rock fan base.  This, coupled with already-present interpersonal tensions within the band that had reached the breaking point caused the band to split in 1996.  Following the split, the members performed with other acts, most notably Blake's Jets To Brazil.  Blake and Chris also returned to college to pursue various degrees while Adam resurrected Blackball Records to reissue much of Jawbreaker's out of print music as well as putting out records by other bands he has been involved with.

The band reunited in 2017."

As wounded and mutilated souls suffering curses unfathomable, death was their eternal verdict. Once submitting to The Reanimator as their Master, inviting The Ghost to indwell within them, and electing to die to themselves, the zombie slaves escaped the clutches of the grave.

Now, these devil's rejects arm themselves with sonic, vibratory executions and images of horrific realities, bringing an onslaught of sound and warning that will ring into eternity. Rest assured, you will be afraid. You will be very afraid.

Fans of The Misfits, Alice Cooper, Type O Negative, Gwar, Kiss, Danzig, and Rob Zombie will find themselves feeling as though they strolling in familiar musical history, yet simultaneously wading through a dense mire of uncharted territory. There’s nothing more terrifying than the unknown. Grave Robber is the one band that can hold your hand on a decidedly horrifying romp, leading you safely to the other side.

Originally formed in 1986, the band went into hiatus from 1991-1993 due to lacking a drummer and bassist. The band's style can be described as edgy melodic punk rock. The band has released nearly all of their releases through Fat Wreck Chords. In 2007, Good Riddance announced that they would break up and performed what was at the time believed to be their final show to a sold out crowd in their hometown on May 27, 2007. A year later, they recorded and released the show as a farewell album. However, Good Riddance reformed for a few shows in 2012, decided to stay together afterwards, and released their first comeback album in 2015.

Out of the Zeitgeist flash of ’70s Punk Rock the new sound took the darkest elements of the counter culture into ever deeper gloomier and more mature territory. 

Performing at legendary San Francisco venues Mabuhay Gardens, Graffiti, The Nightbreak and the rest billed with Christian Death, 45 Grave and all the fellow architects of West Coast Post Punk, the original incarnation passed through a rotating cast of characters centered strongly by the vision and experimental guitar of founding member Kent Cates. Eschewing the conventional chord progression/solo form entirely Cates’s guitar spins strands of melody and rhythm, tone and texture in a style that to this day is all his own. The mood was perfected with the innovative tribal drumming of Aleph Kali and Butch Mason’s haunted confrontational vocals. 

Though the band had a strong base of support, no original recordings were ever released and the young members carried on into new musical endeavors. By 1985 ADF disbanded. 

Years upon years passed yet the name was never completely forgotten. As Goth Punk culture persisted, grew and developed over time the band began to take on a kind of legendary hue among fans in the know; The lost mysterious phenomenon of Altar De Fey. -There was a kind of poetry to it. Finally in 2011, when asked if they would play a reunion for a festival in San Francisco Kent and Aleph surprised everyone by answering yes. 

Reforming originally as a 2-piece with a drum machine, Kent on guitar and Aleph on vocals to an enthusiastic reception, the duo enjoyed it so much they decided to continue the momentum and quickly added Skot Brown on bass, Aleph switched over to live drums, and Jake Hout was added on vocals. The new lineup debuted in April of 2012 and has continued regularly performing songs from the original 80’s catalogue and steadily adding new material ever since."

Within a year, the band's line-up consisted of drummer Dean Johnson, guitarist Tom Roberts (AKA Pig Champion) and bassist Glen Estes. The band was influenced by the like of The Germs, Black Flag, Discharge and SOA. Chris ""Tense"" replaced Glen on bass by the time of their 1983 debut EP, Pick Your King. This and its follow up, Record Collectors are Pretentious Assholes (featuring parts of Pig Champion's record collection on the cover), were both put out on the Fatal Erection label, run by Pig Champion and Malcom Conover from Eugene, Oregon.

In 1986, Poison Idea released the Kings of Punk LP on Pushead's Pusmort label. In the next few years, theirs line-up (mainly the rhythm section) changed several times.

By 1989, they started their own label, American Leather, and began by reissuing their 1982 demo. The band recorded the Discontent 7"" with the line-up of Jerry A., Pig Champion, Myrtle Tickner and Thee Slayer Hippie (the second guitarist switched between ""Mondo"" and Aldine Strichnine). In 1990, they released the Feel the Darkness LP.

In the next three years, they put out several more records - two more full-lengths, some 7""s and an LP collection of cover versions. When Pig Champion decided to leave the band in 1993, they split up. In 1996, the band briefly reformed and recorded a 7"" for Taang!, who also reissued most of their early catalogue. An aborted tour in 1997 saw another break-up, followed by further reformations. In 2017 the group disbanded for good.

The Muffs started as a collaboration between guitarists Kim Shattuck and Melanie Vammen, both former members of the 1980s all-female hard rock group, [a=The Pandoras]. The band started performing and recording after the addition of bassist Ronnie Barnett (Shattuck's then-boyfriend) and drummer Criss Crass.  Following the release of their first album in 1993, Crass left the band.  By the time the band recorded their second LP, 1995's ""Blonder and Blonder"", Melanie Vammen had departed and Roy McDonald was the group's drummer.  This would become The Muffs' definitive line-up.  That same year, the band released one of their best-known songs, a cover of [a=Kim Wilde]'s ""Kids In America"", for the soundtrack to the movie ""Clueless"" (ironically, it was a song that the band reportedly neither liked nor ever performed live).  After 2004's ""Really, Really Happy"" LP the band went on extended hiatus, not returning to action until 2012 (Kim Shattuck credited former drummer Jim Lespesa, who filled in on tour after Chris Crass left, with bringing her, Ronnie Barnett, and Roy McDonald back together).  The band recorded a new album, ""Whoop Dee Doo"" that year but its release was delayed when Shattuck was offered the bass-playing slot in the [a=Pixies].  Her Pixies stint was famously short-lived and the album was released in 2014.  The band's final album, ""No Holiday"" was released in October 2019, shortly after Shattuck's death from complications related to ALS."

The band was initially called The Creeping Ritual.

In 1980, Snowden and Dunning quit the band, and were replaced by [a=Rob Ritter] and [a=Terry Graham] (the rhythm section of the [a=The Bags]). Powers accepted an invite to join [a=The Cramps], and his place on guitar was taken by [a=Ward Dotson]. The new band went on to record the group's classic first two albums, ""Fire Of Love"" & ""Miami"". Ritter left the band in 1982 just before ""Miami"" was released - which is the reason the band is seen as a trio on the LP cover. Dotson soon quit as well.

Ritter taught his basslines to former Bags band-mate [a=Patricia Morrison] before leaving so she joined in his place. Graham quit, and gave his place to [a=Dee Pop]. The next release, the ""Death Party"" EP, came from an improptu recording session that featured [a=Jim Duckworth], and a bassist friend of Pop. For their next album - the only release to feature Morrison on bass - ""Las Vegas Story"" out in 1984, [a=Kid Congo Powers] returned on guitar, and Terry Graham on drums. After some successful tours, Pierce started to travel around the world and the band came to a halt for a period, as he started to work on his solo album. 

In 1987, Pierce staged a comeback for The Gun Club with [a=Kid Congo Powers], Pierce's girfriend [a=Romi Mori] and [a=Nick Sanderson] joining him. The band put out the well-received album ""Mother Juno"" the same year. Three more albums followed, and in 1995 a new line-up was formed including [a=Jeffrey Lee Pierce], [a=Wayne Kramer], [a=Mike Martt], [a=Kid Congo Powers] and [a=Romi Mori]. 

On the 31st of March 1996 the band sadly came to an end due the death of [a=Jeffrey Lee Pierce]. They were notable as one of the first bands in the punk rock subculture to incorporate influences from blues, rockabilly, and country music. The Gun Club has been called a ""tribal psychobilly blues"" band, as well as initiators of the cowpunk and punk blues sound."

Led by guitarist/vocalist Jessica Boudreaux, the Cannibals initially cut their teeth on the local Portland circuit, sharing the stage and receiving encouragement from peers including The Thermals.  Along the way, they released a pair of fantastic full-lengths -- 2013’s No Makeup and 2015’s Show Us Your Mind — on their own label, New Moss Records.  Show Us Your Mind appeared on NPR’s Sound Opinions Best of list in 2015.  The band has since spent an unhealthy amount of time on the road, earning accolades and adding plenty of fresh converts to their highly-charged, no frills attack.

It seemed only logical that when the band decided to sign to a label, they chose Kill Rock Stars, which has a long history of putting out fearless, female-led bands like Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney.  Their most recent release, Full Of It, is the band’s defining statement to date.  Recorded with producer Chris Woodhouse (Thee Oh Sees, Wild Flag), the LP is one of those massive leaps forward that every band hopes to achieve at least once in their career.  Aided by rhythm guitarist Marc Swart, drummer Devon Shirley and bassist Jenny Logan, the 11 songs spark that perfect mix of snotty attitude, unbounded energy, and window rattling volume. 

Since the band's formation they've had the opportunity to play with some their musical heroes, including: Guided By Voices, Mudhoney, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, and The War on Drugs. They've toured the country with The Thermals and CHVRCHES as well as played some major festivals including Sasquatch, Project Pabst and Riot Fest."

Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-'90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyper-kinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single ""Sell Out"" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie ""Baseketball"" as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world. 
Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, ""Everything Sucks"", in 1995. ""Everything Sucks"" became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced ""Turn the Radio Off"", which marked Reel Big Fish's first album for Mojo. ""Turn the Radio Off"" was released in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single ""Sell Out"" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.
In 1998 the song ""Take on Me"" from the ""Baseketball"" motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA. 
The Album ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"" followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for ""the Set up (You Need This)"", the only single released from this album. 
The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled ""Cheer Up!"", appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single ""Where HaveYou Been"" receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels. 
Later that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called ""Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk"" which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"" for the Nickelodeon movie ""The Wild Thornberrys"". The single for ""Monkey Man"" was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.
The band's next album, the cynical yet catchy ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy"", was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the ""Cheer Up!"" release.
In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled ""Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"". Barrett said of this album: ""We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!"" The album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as ""the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album"" because of all the silly stage banter.
The band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP ""Duet All Night Long"" with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. ""Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free"" followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster.
2009's ""Fame, Fortune and Fornication"" found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.
In 2010, the band released ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"". It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or ""SKAcoustic"" versions.
2012 brought their 7th studio album, ""Candy Coated Fury"" (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyper-kinetic ska and biting wit of the band's beloved early albums. 
In 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled ""Happy Skalidays"". The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.
With the late-2018 release of the band's 8th studio LP, ""Life Sucks...Let's Dance"" (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a--dare we say it--happier outlook on life. Barrett says, ""We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio ""Pot of Gold"" in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There's just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there's a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there's a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!"" He adds, ""Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows. The single ""You Can't Have All of Me"", is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn't reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!"""

Dharmavit dasa and Markandeya dasa are the two original founding members.


SAFE started out as a studio project when singer Dharmavit dasa and the guitarist Markandeya dasa were busy with other bands recording. With the ""Ride A New Season"" CD (2014) they decided to form a permanent band to play gigs and make SAFE a legit band. The sound at the time was a melodic hardcore with personal lyrics. SAFE played a bunch of shows but decided to take a break when Dharmavit moved from Italy to Germany in 2016. On the edge of the Black Forest, he and the drummer Matt Cantatore (ex Fumbles In Life) regrouped the band with german members and they released the ""Stay Strong"" 7""ep in spring 2018: three fast, positive, powerful and melodic hardcore songs. In november 2018 they were locked into a studio again and recorded 9 new songs for their ""Power Of Bliss"" LP. They recorded the album at Proxy studio in Stuttgart. In his Salad Days studio in Baltimore, Brian McTernan (Battery, Ashes, Be Well) took care of the final mixing and mastering of the songs and out came a mix of solid, melodic and explosive hardcore, a perfect compromise between the typical “youth crew” sound of the eighties with a lot of melodies. In 2021 came out the ""Unselfish"" 7""ep with three new songs. The lyrics are based on introspection, spirituality and a PMA mindset!

The band spent the subsequent two years supporting its second album, playing hundreds of shows, large and small. Nervous Curtains kept a low profile throughout the majority of 2014 while recording and producing its third album, Con, and other still-forthcoming releases. In the meantime, Kirkpatrick played synthesizer and piano on Swans’ To Be Kind.﻿

Con is the trio's most raw and confident album to date. The album plays up the rhythmic tension between pulsing synthesizers and live drums while merging these elements into a blast of defiant energy and enduring tunes. With this album, Nervous Curtains has created a space in which paranoia is a cultural commodity amidst a battleground of convictions and contradictions The band again worked with seasoned engineer Matthew Barnhart as well as This Will Destroy You’s Alex Bhore and received some co-production perspective and guest vocal assistance from Pinkish Black’s Daron Beck."

Deaf Kids were formed in 2010 by guitarist Douglas Leal, a native of Volta Redonda in Rio de Janeiro, who originally conceived it as a one-man d-beat project. Recording on his own, Leal was prolific. In June 2011, Leal issued the first Deaf Kids release, a self-titled album, followed shortly by an EP titled 6 Heretic Anthems for the Deaf. A split EP with O Mito da Caverna followed in September 2012, and a limited-edition single, Truth/Freedom, appeared in April 2013. The second full album from Deaf Kids, The Upper Hand, appeared in October 2013, with the cassette-only release I Am the Sickness following before the year was out. In 2014, the group went through a transformation. Leal relocated from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo, and Deaf Kids became a proper band with the addition of bassist Marcelo Dos Santos and drummer Robinho, who was soon replaced by Mariano de Melo. Now able to more easily play live, Deaf Kids' profile began to rise in the international metal and underground music communities, and word spread around the world about the group through the internet. They received solid reviews for 2015's Ao Longo dos Dias Um Tanto Danificado, and a tour of Europe was documented with the LP Live in Slovenija 2016. Enthusiastic blog posts about Deaf Kids and rave reviews for their 2016 cassette release Configuração do Lamento led to its reissue on vinyl and CD through Neurot Recordings."

The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, Lemmy had always dubbed their music as simply ""rock and roll"".

To its end, Motörhead had released twenty-three studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, Motörhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.

Motörhead are typically classified as Rock N Roll by Lemmy and band members, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name ""Motörhead"" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as ""War-Pig"" and ""Snaggletooth"". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

When Lemmy Kilmister died in December 2015, Mickey Dee declared that Motörhead (officially) is disbanded. No more tours or albums will be made. Only the brand will survive for the future.

Their latest release  “The Perplexed Sky”   is a story of highs and lows; of intense relationships, of bliss, delusions and the resurfacing of demons. Singer/songwriter Jack Murray plays with the idea of self in today’s world, examining how our own perceptions are different than how others see us. “The Perplexed Sky”  was produced by J. Robbins, a prominent figure in the legendary DC music scene of the 80s and 90s, at Magpie Cage in Baltimore. J’s previous work includes Jawbox and Government Issue (member) as well as Clutch, Against Me!, and Jawbreaker (recording and production) among many others. The album is available on translucent dark purple vinyl, CD, and all digital platforms.

The band’s live shows are a mix of noise, melody and frustration. As a duo, Jack uses guitars with bass parts built-in. This creates distinct bass and guitar sounds that feed into separate amplifiers, similar to 90’s act Local H, but with Jack’s own technique and performance. Drummer Korey Hershberger sets-up his kit at the front of the stage to directly engage the crowd. The band has played throughout the mid-Atlantic region opening for national acts such as Smile Empty Soul, Flaw, and legendary British post-punk band Skeletal Family. In the last year-and-a-half, they have played a number of local venues including Baltimore Soundstage, The Black Cat (DC), The Windup Space, Angel’s Rock Bar at Power Plant Live!, The Crown, Fish Head Cantina, among many others, having been invited to perform at all but a few by local and touring acts or promoters. They have also performed at festivals including the Liberty Musicfest in Philadelphia and the Jersey Shore Music Festival in New Jersey.

The band has its roots in Gainesville, FL where they released their first EP  “Kakistocracy” (2015), recorded by Roger Lima (Less Than Jake). Shortly after, Jack moved to NYC where the band released their second EP “..:Or the Devil Will Get You”  recorded at If and Only If Productions in Brooklyn as well as a limited 7″ split on Leesta Vall Sound Recordings. In 2017 Jack came to Baltimore and immersed himself in the local scene. After quickly establishing a presence with a number of shows, the band began work on “The Perplexed Sky”  in 2018.

Influenced by bands such as The Wipers, Screaming Trees, REM, Agent Orange, Nirvana and the White Stripes, they are often described as ranging from surf punk to garage rock, alternative and even paisley underground. One promoter described their new album as “dream garage alt-punk” while the album’s producer J. Robbins said certain elements reminded him of post-punk band The Chameleons."

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did."

Led by guitarist/vocalist Jessica Boudreaux, the Cannibals initially cut their teeth on the local Portland circuit, sharing the stage and receiving encouragement from peers including The Thermals.  Along the way, they released a pair of fantastic full-lengths -- 2013’s No Makeup and 2015’s Show Us Your Mind — on their own label, New Moss Records.  Show Us Your Mind appeared on NPR’s Sound Opinions Best of list in 2015.  The band has since spent an unhealthy amount of time on the road, earning accolades and adding plenty of fresh converts to their highly-charged, no frills attack.

It seemed only logical that when the band decided to sign to a label, they chose Kill Rock Stars, which has a long history of putting out fearless, female-led bands like Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney.  Their most recent release, Full Of It, is the band’s defining statement to date.  Recorded with producer Chris Woodhouse (Thee Oh Sees, Wild Flag), the LP is one of those massive leaps forward that every band hopes to achieve at least once in their career.  Aided by rhythm guitarist Marc Swart, drummer Devon Shirley and bassist Jenny Logan, the 11 songs spark that perfect mix of snotty attitude, unbounded energy, and window rattling volume. 

Since the band's formation they've had the opportunity to play with some their musical heroes, including: Guided By Voices, Mudhoney, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, and The War on Drugs. They've toured the country with The Thermals and CHVRCHES as well as played some major festivals including Sasquatch, Project Pabst and Riot Fest."

Finn & His Rust Kickers is a NY based earth-shaking rock/punk/skronk/country/ska/noise band featuring members of Erratic Sculpture, pigEARTH,and The Skels. 
The Rustkickers was founded in 2014 and was originally intended as a one-off gig between old friends. It quickly evolved into a genuine creative outlet, as well as an opportunity to make some noise. Work on what would eventually become their debut album ""...Leave You Nothing to Squander..."" began in 2016. In January 2017 they began a monthly series of digital singles to give away from their Bandcamp page as work progressed on the album. A live album recorded at a May 2017 show was also released. Their first physical release, a 7"" single of their cover of ""Impeach the President"" was released in the Autumn of 2017.
 ""...Leave You Nothing to Squander..."" was released in February 2018 both digitally and as a limited edition two record set. Its lead-off single ""on Peckham Rye"" was also released on vinyl and is the subject of the band's first official video. 2018 also saw the release of two animated videos for tracks from ""Squander..."", Karaoke Funeral and Dream Date with Lydia Kavina. A limited-edition cassette EP of tracks recorded live to tape in the studio was also released in 2018.
So far 2019 has seen the continuation of our Digital Singles series and the release of another live-in-the-studio EP of covers released both digitally and as a limited edition run of lathe cut 10"" records. Our second album, titled ""One More Notorious Crime"" will be released digitally on 08/02/2019 with a vinyl release coming Autumn 2019

The band's main lineup included [a=Jeff Mueller] and [a=Jason B. Noble] on guitar and vocals, [a=Tara Jane O'Neil] on bass/vocals, and [a=Kevin Coultas] on drums. The band was preceded by an experimental hip-hop project [b][a=King G & The J Krew][/b], started by Mueller and Noble with [a=Greg King (2)] in 1989. They spent two years painstakingly working on a debut album [m=944030], which was released in 1992. The group started playing live with a more rock-oriented lineup, under the name [b]King Kid International[/b] (Jeff and Jason on guitars/vocals, Tara O'Neil on bass, and [a=Jon Cook] on drums). Soon after, King Kid Intl became Rodan. Cook soon left the band; he was briefly replaced by [a=John Weiss], and finally by Coultas.

In 1993, Rodan recorded an [i]Aviary[/i] demo. Two songs from this tape were re-recorded and released as [r=563661] 7-inch on [l=Three Little Girls Recordings]. Their debut album [m=39797] on [l=Quarterstick Records] in 1994 was co-produced by [a=Jason Loewenstein] and included six tracks from Aviary, some re-recorded in Chicago by [a=Robert Weston] ([a=Shellac]). Never officially signed to any label, Rodan had been actively collaborating with [l=Simple Machines] – they appeared on several compilations and played at the label's [i]Working Holiday[/i] festival.

The band's members played a fictional musical group [b][a=Truckstop][/b] in the cult road movie [i]Half-Cocked[/i], and also contributed to its [url=https://www.discogs.com/master/39807]soundtrack[/url], released by [l=Matador]. In 1995, Rodan also recorded three songs for a [a=John Peel] session. Kevin Coultas left the band the same year, replaced by Jon Cook at live shows. Soon after, Rodan disbanded. Members of the group continued working together in various bands: Coultas played with Noble in [a=Rachel's], and O'Neil in [a=The Sonora Pine], while Mueller and Noble started [a=Shipping News] in late 1996.

In 2013, Quarterstick Records released [m=572832] compilation. It includes songs recorded for BBC Peel Sessions, Rodan debut single, tracks from Half-Cocked soundtrack, and a few songs previously available on 7-inch compilations on Simple Machines, Compulsiv Music, and Slamdek Records. All tracks were remastered by Bob Weston."

Yelchin died in a freak accident at his home at only 27; after he failed to arrive at a rehearsal in June 2016, Anton's body was found pinned between his Jeep Grand Cherokee and a brick pillar outside his house in Studio City, Los Angeles. Apparently, he parked the car in the driveway and went to retrieve mail at the locked gate downhill when the vehicle rolled back spontaneously and crushed him against the fence. By tragic coincidence, [url=https://discogs.com/label/1039725]Fiat Chrysler Automobiles[/url] was aware of rollaway incidents for 2014-2015 Grand Cherokee models caused by a problematic gearshift design and already issued a recall in April 2016. The required software patch to fix the gear indicator only reached Fiat Chrysler dealerships on the week of Yelchin's death. His parents sued FCA for wrongful death in August 2016, settling out of court two years later."

Born 22 August 1952 in Bay Village, Ohio, USA / d. 22 June 1977, aged 24 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, of acute pancreatitis. 

Best known for being in the ""classic"" late period lineup of [a=Rocket From The Tombs] (1974-75) and also co-founding [a=Pere Ubu] in September 1975 after Rocket's split that July. Laughner was dismissed from Ubu in mid-1976, after appearing on two 45's with them.

Laughner started his first band, The Fifth Edition, in 1965 while he was in middle school. In 1967, The Fifth Edition became Mr. Charlie and lasted until 1970. Bands that followed include a 1971-72 stint in the Mr. Stress Blues Band as well as his own bands The Original Wolverines (1972), Space Age Thrills (1972), Cinderella Backstreet (1973), Blue Drivers (1973), Cinderella's Revenge (1974), Fins (aka The Finns) (1974), Peter & The Wolves (which featured [a=Adele Bertei], 1975-76), Friction (1976-77), Cleveland Blues Underground (1977), and his final band Wolves (1977) (not to be confused with the earlier Peter & the Wolves). 

He championed the underground music of Cleveland and elsewhere, regularly visiting New York as the CBGB's scene was taking off in the early '70s parallel to the Ohio music scene which led to him booking the first Television show outside of NYC at Cleveland's Piccadilly Inn.  

He recorded hours of songs to tape, most of which have never been officially released. These include many originals and covers, solo, duo, or with his bands, as well as collaborations w/ Lester Bangs, Peter Stampfel, Terry Hartman, Rockne Riddlebarger, David Krauss (of Tiny Alice), Charlotte Pressler (his wife during 1971-1976), Ruby Port (aka Helen York) and others.

Laughner also wrote for Creem, Zeppelin, Exit magazines, as well as the local Plain Dealer and Akron's Beacon Journal newspapers amongst other publications featuring his poetry, prose, music reviews and articles."

Tepper co-wrote Mardones' hit song ""Into the Night,"" which not only hit the top charts and earned a Grammy nomination on its initial release in 1980, but re-charted again nearly a decade later.

In 1985, Tepper moved to Los Angeles, signing a record deal with Scotti Brothers. When Sylvester Stallone heard ""No Easy Way Out"", he chose to use it on the Rocky IV soundtrack and in the film, becoming one of the year's biggest hits. ""No Easy Way Out"" was issued as a single, climbing into the Top 30 in early 1986. It preceded Tepper's debut, but failed to retain the public's interest. One more single, ""Don't Walk Away,"" made a showing, stalling in the lower reaches of the Hot 100. The album ""Modern Madness"" came with no notice two years later, followed by Tepper separating from the label in protracted legal proceedings.

After the second album, Tepper got caught up in the recording industry politics and was chained without being able to get out of a deal for several years. Without being able to record any new solo albums, Tepper accepted the chance to join the reformed act [a=Iron Butterfly], which he toured America with, and also started to record an album for, with nearly Tepper writing all the songs. Eventually, Robert Tepper finally got out of the deal with Scotti Brothers and was free to record as a solo artist again. Iron Butterfly's label offered Robert the chance to record a solo album, life looked pretty happening for him again. But before Robert had the chance the accept the Iron Butterfly treaty or produce a third solo album, the whole set up of the record label were signed to fall apart and Robert was once again part of the music industry politics. There really was ""No Easy Way Out"" for him. 

After years of been locked away and spending the time writing songs, Robert felt strong enough to get back to the action again and decided to get a new album out. In 1996, ""No Rest For The Wounded Heart"", the third of Robert Tepper's solo albums was finally released, on MTM records.

264349,1629295,14331613,US,Hootie & The Blowfish,Imperfect Circle,2019,42.43,13,['Album'],"['Rock', 'Pop']",['Pop Rock'],"With the rich, bluesy vocals of Darius Rucker and gleeful harmonies of guitarist Mark Bryan, bassist Dean Felber and drummer Jim “Soni” Sonefeld, Hootie & the Blowfish sold over 25 million records worldwide after their infectious melodies hit the airwaves in 1994 with hits such as “Hold My Hand”, “Let Her Cry” and “Only Wanna Be With You.”

One of the biggest misconceptions to most people is that Hootie & The Blowfish became an overnight success in 1994 when their debut album Cracked Rear View, moved over 16 million copies (and counting) in the U. S. alone. What most people don’t know was that the album’s triumph came after a decade of hard work.

The quartet met while attending the University of South Carolina in Columbia in the late 1980s. New freshman Mark Bryan heard Darius Rucker singing in the showers of the dorm they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability. Bryan and Rucker began playing cover tunes as The Wolf Brothers and eventually hooked up with Dean Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan’s, and Brantley Smith as Hootie & The Blowfish. (The unlikely moniker was borrowed from the nicknames of two college friends.) When Smith’s true passion called him home to Greenville, SC in 1989, Bryan reached out to classmate Jim (Soni) Sonefeld to join the band and the immediate chemistry was undeniable!

By the time they graduated, endless gigs at frat parties and local bars had built a major local buzz. “We’d started adding original material to our repertoire,” Bryan recalled. “Our songs went over well, so we decided to see if we could make a career out of it. Even if we hadn’t had a hit, I know we’d still be making music today, because it’s exactly what we want to be doing.”

The band’s secret weapon, and the force that pulls all of its diverse influences together, is the voice of Darius Rucker, an expressive instrument brimming with gritty soul and subtle wit. When he sings, the songs are imbued with a buoyant good humor and an openhearted joy that connects on an almost spiritual level with audiences all over the world. “Having Darius in the band is a wonderful luxury,” Mark Bryan explained. “We can try something funky, or bluegrassy or a ballad; we can run the gamut stylistically, but never stray too far from our sound because once Darius starts singing, it’s Hootie and the Blowfish.

In the next five years, Hootie & The Blowfish worked their way up the food chain from local draw to gigs all over the Carolinas and finally, the entire East Coast. Their blend of pop, folk, blues, soul and rock made them hard to pigeonhole, but easily accessible to anyone who loved good music. Atlantic Records, impressed by the tens of thousands of Kootchypop copies already sold without the help of a label, signed them and released Cracked Rear View in 1994. The album had been out for six months before the band played on the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman told his audience “If you don’t have this album, there’s something wrong with you.” The day after the show aired, sales went from four or five thousand a week to 17,000 a week, and eventually Number One on the Billboard charts the following spring. It remains a strong seller today. “It became dream-like,” Rucker recalled. “I’d wished for it, but I’m not sure I believed it, even as it was happening. We were on tour constantly; the whole thing is still kind of a blur.”

At the end of the year, Cracked Rear View and the band won two Grammy’s – Best New Artist and Song of the Year by duo or group for “Let Her Cry.” They also took home an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist for “Hold My Hand,” a Billboard Music Award for album of the year, a People’s Choice Award for Album of the Year and a People’s Choice Award for Best Selling Artist, a feat they duplicated in 1996.

Cracked Rear View went on to earn the band Billboard’s Band of the Year Award in 1996 and the RIAA’s Diamond Award for sales of 10 million units. Cracked Rear View remains the 9th best selling album in music business history, and all albums combined, have moved over 25 million worldwide.

The band kept touring, remaining a top draw nationwide and released five more albums for Atlantic: Fairweather Johnson, Musical Chairs, Scattered, Smothered & Covered, Hootie & The Blowfish and The Best of Hootie & The Blowfish. The band left Atlantic by mutual agreement in 2004; Looking For Lucky released in 2005 was their first album on their own Sneaky Long Records, manufactured and distributed by Vanguard. LIVE in Charleston, The Homegrown Concert Event DVD and CD was released in August of 2006.

Hootie & the Blowfish wrapped a summer of touring in 2008 and members entered the studio to record solo albums. Since then, Soni has released 4 albums including a trilogy called Found (2012), In (2014) and Love (2015). Mark has released 3 albums with his most recent release, Songs of the Fortnight in Summer 2017 and Darius released his fifth country album, When Was The Last Time in Fall 2017.

In December of 2018, the band appeared on the Today Show to announce a return to full-time touring along with news of a forthcoming album. The 2019 Group Therapy Tour saw the band play to sold-out crowds across the U.S. and Canada, including two nights at the iconic Madison Square Garden, as well as a run of shows throughout the U.K. and Ireland. The triumphant return to the road earned Hootie & the Blowfish several prominent profiles recognizing their important musical legacy, including the cover story of the New York Times Arts & Leisure section. On November 1, 2019, they released their first new music in nearly 15 years with Imperfect Circle, named one of the “biggest albums to hear this season” by Entertainment Weekly and featuring radio single “Hold On.”"

Two areas that differ are sound quality and set length. Mark Benson who portrays John Lennon in the band, says the original Beatles live performances in the 1960s, the fans were lucky to hear the music. You have to credit The Beatles with revolutionising the sound reinforcement industry, says Benson. Back then they had these little speakers that you couldn't hear anything out of. The way concerts were Amplified had to be changed. Benson says fans who saw the original shows notice the difference. People will come to us and say, I saw the Beatles in 64 and the only difference is I can hear you, Benson says.

Another difference is set length. The Beatles did to 30 minutes at sin there early shows and never did on course, while 1964 the tribute performs to 45 minute sets. We tried the half-hour show initially but it didn't go over well, says Benson.

The members of the group decided which member would portray which Beatle based on the instrument he played. I was a guitarist, so the natural thing was the John or the George character, says Tom work, who portrays George Harrison. The way I got into this was, the fellow playing John Lennon, join the band that was a local Beatles tribute at. This was around 1981. After about a year, he got his buddy Gary Grimes to join and play Paul, and I was friends with him. About a year later, he got me to join and play George. Over the years, the lineup has included;

Mark Benson 1984 to present as John Lennon

Gary Grimes 1984 to 2009, Todd Rainey 2009 to 2010, Ricky Vacca 2010 to 2011, Graham Alexander 2011 to 2013, Mac Ruffing 2013 to the present as Paul McCartney

Tom Work 1984 to 1986, 1990 to 1993, 2006 to the present, Robert Miller 1986 to 1990, Tom Teeley 1993 to 1994, Jimmy Pou 1994 to 2006 as George Harrison

Greg George 1984 to 2006, Terry Manfredi 2006 to 2010, Bobby Potter 2010 to the present as Ringo Starr

The band's mission is to accurately recreate the 1964 Beatles invasion of America. Members play a set of early Beatles music, with some middle Beatles thrown in. Sometimes the group's costumes reflect the Beatles early period, and sometimes members wear replicas of the Shea Stadium concert apparel from 1965. The concept is performing a show that gives you an idea of what it was like to see The Beatles when they were touring, says Benson. It's definitely a music gig, but there's an acting element to it says Work. None of us is really an actor per se. I probably come closes because I've done some plays, just in Community Theatre. But there's some acting. You need to adopt the body language, the speaking voice. Those two things, I guess, for this kind of role are two aspects that resemble acting. Everything else is more musicianship and vocal impersonation singing I mean. The group separates is life on stage from off stage. We didn't want to be them, just wanted to portray them says Work. No one really considered wearing those boots around all the time or the tight pants for having hair that look like that. We were musicians before, professional, full-time musicians. We didn't start doing Beatles until we were 30. The members are getting older, but are doing better than ever.

1964 the tribute, originally called 1964 as the Beatles is a Beatles tribute band that was formed in 1984.
The origin is in the United States and they are active to the present day. The group plans to continue performing. Asked about their future, Tom work, who portrays George Harrison said , ""the answer to that is the answer Gary gave his dad. His dad asked him how long are you going to do this? And Gary Grimes who played Paul McCartney until his death in 2010 said, until they stop coming. We are not anywhere close to the age The Beatles were. I'm sure many people will comment, they're starting to look a little old to be doing this, but people are still coming. Just being a musician keeps you young at heart."

Despite being from Berkeley, California, the band's music usually invoked imagery of the American South.

John Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford initially joined forces in 1959 as The Blue Velvets and later backed John's older brother, Tom, as Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets.  The group later changed their name to the Golliwogs and released several unsuccessful singles.  In 1967, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival and John Fogerty took total control of the group.  CCR was extremely prolific, releasing 6 albums and various singles between 1968 and 1970.  However, the other members of the band chafed under John Fogerty's domination and in 1971 it was announced that Tom Fogerty had left the band.  CCR made one more album, 1972's ""Mardi Gras"", as a trio.  In the wake of Tom's departure, John, responding the other members' requests to have more say in band matters, stipulated that both Cook and Clifford had to contribute equally to the writing and recording.  The album was poorly received and CCR subsequently split.

In the years following their split, the animosities between John and the other members grew.  When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1993, John infamously barred Cook and Clifford from the stage (Tom had passed away in 1990).

It was started by Toru with High School friends Alex and Ryota after each of them got their musical instruments. After that, Taka joined as their vocalist and they focused on performing shows in the Tokyo area.

In 2006 they independently released 2 mini albums. Because of their albums sales, their participation in relatively large festivals that summer and their energetic shows in the outskirts of Tokyo, they were noticed by a foreign record company.

In March 2007 Tomoya officially joined the group and the band finally made their major debut by releasing their first single 内秘心書(Naihi Shinsho) on April 25th.

The band’s name, One Ok Rock, came from “one o’clock,” the time that the band used to practice on weekends. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between r’s and l’s, they changed “o’clock” to “o’crock” (or “o’krock”) which then was separated to become “ok rock”.

On April 5th, 2009, Alex was arrested for allegedly groping a female prep school student. They were going to release the single 「Ａｒｏｕｎｄ　ザ　ｗｏｒｌｄ　少年」on May 6th but this was cancelled. The song was also going to be used for the drama ‘God Hand Teru’ but was replaced. Also, a nationwide tour was cancelled because of the incident.

Their sound is thunderous and chaotic, utilizing a wall of noise techniques through an onslaught of keys, guitars and drums. Myke Pelly's off kilter drumming and Colin Dawson's architectural noise structures create jittery post-punk that is both upbeat and gloomy. Most recently, the band enlisted Seattle-based bassist Brian McClelland of Filth is Eternal and He Whose Ox is Gored, creating an added level of heavy rhythmic noise that not only contributes an exciting dynamic layer to the album sonically, but to their already-captivating live performance as well. The bleak vocals are persistently ominous in a seductive way, conjuring up the nightmarish aura of a dissonant horror-film soundtrack. With reviewers like Anthony Fantano (Needle Drop) likening their previous work to legendary bands such as Swans, Bauhaus, and Killing Joke, Haunted Horses carry on the tradition of noise that can terrorize as well as entrance, oftentimes simultaneously. This is evident in the list of hard-hitting contemporaries they’ve shared the stage and toured with, including Lingua Ignota, Portrayal of Guilt, A Place to Bury Strangers, Bambara, and Boy Harsher.

After regional punk rock heroes Shyster called it quits in 1999, singer/songwriter Mike Levin decided to start over. This time he chose to incorporate his own influences, such as grass roots folk and classic soul, along with his already fortified punk roots to produce a more melodic, soulful approach. And so The New Lows was born.

In 2002, Levin moved to New York City, put together a new lineup, and quickly hit the circuit playing as many shows as possible. In 2008, The New Lows recorded their second full length release, ""Atlantic/Pacific,"" with former Shyster bassist Wes Snowden and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion drummer Russell Simins. Filled with hard-charging riffs, beautiful harmonies, and resonating lyrics, the album was met with great reviews and proved to be a fortuitous launching point for what was to come.

Following the release, Levin decided to return to Florida. He soon assembled local players, drummer Gregg Lightfoot and guitarist/keyboardist Bobby Pino, to join him and Snowden. After playing continuously for the last two years, the group went to acclaimed New Orleans recording studio The Living Room to record their next album. The anxiously anticipated ""I Couldn't Sleep"" was released November 13, 2012. It's available for purchase on Bandcamp, iTunes, and Amazon.

In the summer of 2013, The New Lows embarked on a 3-week tour around the U.S. Shortly after, Lightfoot left the band and was replaced by ex-VRGNS drummer Eric Pitman. In October 2013, ""I Couldn't Sleep"" was released on split-colored, limited-edition vinyl (500 copies) on Kiss of Death Records and The New Lows played a packed show at FEST 12 in Gainesville, Florida."

5951,9382,1111653,France,Serge Gainsbourg,Histoire De Melody Nelson,1971,28.07,7,"['LP', 'Album']","['Rock', 'Pop']",['Psychedelic'],"(April 2, 1928 – March 2, 1991) Poet, singer-songwriter, painter, actor and director. Born in Paris, France, the son of Jewish Russian parents. He had well known children : a daughter, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Charlotte+Gainsbourg]Charlotte[/url], with [a=Jane Birkin]; and a son, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lulu+Gainsbourg]Lucien Gainsbourg[/url] (aka Lulu), with his last partner, [a=Bambou]. Two other children are non-mediatics  : Natacha (born 8 August 1964) and Paul (born 13 April 1968) with Françoise Antoinette Pancrazzi.
 
Serge Gainsbourg (born Lucien Ginsburg), wanted to be a painter but earned his living as a piano player in bars. He was tapped to join the cast of the musical 'Milord L'Arsouille', where he reluctantly assumed a singing role; self-conscious about his rather homely appearance, Gainsbourg initially wanted only to carve out a niche as a composer and producer, never as a performer.

His early influence was [a=Boris Vian]. Gainsbourg wanted to free himself from what he considered old-fashioned 'chanson' and explore other musical grounds, influenced especially by British and American pop. He also wrote soundtracks for more than 40 movies and directed himself in four movies: 'Je t'aime... moi non plus' (10 years censored*), 'Equateur', 'Charlotte For Ever' and 'Stan The Flasher'.

*  [r=541072] (1969) the song, featured simulated sounds of female orgasm. Originally recorded with [a=Brigitte Bardot], it was instead released with a future girlfriend [a=Jane Birkin] as Brigitte Bardot backed out. The song was censored in many countries and in France even the toned-down version was suppressed. The Vatican made a public statement citing the song as offensive. Its notoriety led to it reaching no. 1 in the UK chart.

A frequent interpreter of Gainsbourg's songs was British torch singer [a=Petula Clark], whose success in France was propelled by her recordings of his tunes but the first English-language version of a Gainsbourg song was [a=Dionne Warwick]'s 1965 version of 'Mamadou'.

Concept album [r=408587] produced and arranged by [a=Jean-Claude Vannier] was somewhat based on Nabokov's novel Lolita. It has proven influential with artists such as [a=Air], [a=David Holmes] who covered a track and [a=Beck].

in 1978 with [a=Robbie Shakespeare], [a=Sly Dunbar] and [a=Rita Marley] he made a Reggae version of the French national anthem ""La Marseillaise"". His version earned him death threats from right wing veterans of the Algerian War of Independence (OAS). Gainsbourg was able to reply to his critics that his version was in fact closer to the original as the manuscript clearly shows the words ""Aux armes et cætera..."" for the chorus."

By early 2000 Bryan moved to New York to attend film school at New York University. While completing his degree Bryan began to get disillusioned by camera folk and began recording elaborate demos of his own power pop tunes.In the three years it took to complete his course, Bryan had managed to amass an album's worth of songs. It was these demos that ultimately won over LA based, indie label Black and Greene records who dutifully signed Scary.

This opportunity enabled Scary to clean up his demos and replace his own pre-programmed beats with live drums played by Apollo Sunshine's Jeremy Black. On Halloween 2006, appropriately enough, Bryan Scary and the Shredding Tears was released to the world.

To support the record, Scary put together a touring band – ALSO called The Shredding Tears.(A confusing predicament which the songwriter has recently remedied, he’s just Bryan Scary now). Backing Scary’s vocals and keyboards were second keyboardist Mike Acreman, guitarist Graham Norwood, bassist David Ostrem, and drummer Brian Bauer.

Scary and his band soon began to draw a large word of mouth following, due to their glam, theatrical stage show. Each song was given its own glittering visual representation, complete with wacky costumes and set pieces all of which was filtered through the darkly comedic mind and maniacal stage persona of Bryan Scary.The band drew comparisons to Queen, ELO, Sparks, and Of Montreal, among other artists unafraid to court the dramatic. 

After some heavy touring, Scary and the band returned to the studio  to begin crafting the next album, the first to feature his touring ensembleIn 2007 the band launched multiple tours nationwide. In September–October 2007, the band went into the studio to record their newest album 'Flight of the Knife'. 

(See Bryan Scary & The Shredding Tears)

The band spent 2009 touring the Mad Valentines EP, before getting back in the studio in order to produce third full-length release. Entitled Daffy's Elixir it is a wild west-themed conceptual album which was funded in part by money pledged from friends and fans through Kickstarter.com. More than $16,000 was raised towards production of the album. Bryan recorded fully orchestrated demos for his band members which were then worked out in rehearsals prior to the sessions. On February 25, 2010 the recording sessions for the album began in Brooklyn, NY with producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Phish). Goggin had previously mixed the single ""Red Umbrella"" for Bryan Scary which was included on the Mad Valentines EP.

The completed DAFFY’S ELIXIR is an epic double album featuring cons, quacks, cow-gal robots, spurned lovers, villains and bandits, all set in the Old West. Euro-centric art-pop meets Spaghetti-Westernisms and old-time yarn spinning, a unique stew congealed by Scary’s most ambitious musical arrangements yet. 

Daffy's Elixir was released April 24, 2012, on Paper Garden Records/Lavaslope "

He lives twenty minutes out a decrepit one-and-a-half lane road in the wilderness of the Sierra Nevada foothills with his wife, daughter, and dog, and when he’s not touring he teaches high school Drama and English.

Through grassroots promotion (and a little luck with the algorithms) he’s been heard by half a million people on Spotify, and had his songs streamed over 2 million times. Grover performs live with his band The Lampoliers (Josh Certo, Anthony Delaney, & Marshall Henry), and at least once a year he tours a different region of the United States, performing acoustic shows and house concerts.

Mercy Choir is the songwriting and recording project of New Haven, CT based musician Paul Belbusti. Since 2004, Belbusti has produced a large quantity of critically acclaimed music ranging from abstract experiments to more traditional pop and rock and roll, released both digitally and physically on his own imprint (Dead Language Records) and collaboratively. Mercy Choir, as a recording project, is generally Belbusti alone (with a few exceptions), recording in his home studio with a mixture of analog and digital instruments and techniques. As a live band, Mercy Choir is a shifting and evolving entity. Many musicians and friends pass through. Join and rejoin. Contributing arrangements and breathing new life into songs that may have started as crude, lofi, sketches. The Mercy Choir discography is joyously uneven and unpredictable.

HOME OF KIM WARE'S INDIE-FOLK / AMERICANA COLLECTIVE AND RELATED PROJECTS
Singer, songwriter, and drummer-turned-guitarist Kim Ware of the Good Graces is known for her unique brand of raw, folk-leaning “southern indie” music. Performing with a rotating cast of musicians, Ware has been crafting tracks with both guts and heart since picking up her first guitar in 2006. She’s one of those rare artists whose melodic lines and candid lyrics feel so natural they’re almost unnatural; she’s been praised as a “songwriter’s songwriter” as well as “an Atlanta treasure” by local musicians and press alike. 
Named after Ware’s spirited grandmother, Grace, the Good Graces blend the gritty realness of 90s-era alternative rock with the straightforward charm of classic country and folk, inspired by artists like Lucinda Williams, Liz Phair, Kathleen Edwards, and Lydia Loveless. There’s an irresistibly relatable humanity to Ware’s music, which seems to transcend masculine and feminine perspectives to create an accessible, gender-neutral tone: She’s part Taylor Swift, part Joni Mitchell, with a little John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats thrown in for good measure. Driven by Ware’s knack for deceptively simple narrative lines, the Good Graces make songs that explore life’s unresolvable dichotomies through lyrics that feel both intimate and universal. “I’ve always tried to make my songs a very honest reflection of who I am. But what part of life fits neatly in a box? Life is not a simple thing. So I often end up writing about that non-simplicity.”
Born and raised in a small North Carolina town called Kings Mountain, Ware was a naturally introverted child. Her love of music led her to take up drumming, where she could participate in songs safely from the back of the stage. She got her first drum kit for Christmas at sixteen and taught herself to play, drumming in alt-rock bands (including popular Wilmington, NC act Tex Svengali) throughout her twenties and thirties. Eventually she moved to Atlanta, where she joined two bands whose songwriters (Jeff Evans of Chickens and Pigs and Mary O. Harrison of Virginia Plane) inspired a new appreciation for lyric-driven, narrative songwriting. But it wasn’t until 2006, after finding an old acoustic guitar at the Lakewood Antiques Market, that Ware began writing and singing her own work as the Good Graces. “It took time to let go of my insecurity and reluctance to be in front. I had to learn to appreciate vulnerability, because I realized that’s what people respond to.” the Good Graces have been compared to Neko Case, Drive-By Truckers, Phoebe Bridgers, and the Weepies, with a wide spectrum of songs celebrated for their melodic strength and frank lyrical observations on life’s complexities and inconsistencies.
Since 2006, Ware and the Good Graces have toured the East Coast, Texas, California, and the Midwest, performed at festivals including 30A, NXNE, and LEAF (where Ware was a finalist in the 2019 NewSong Singer-Songwriter Competition), and shared stages with a long list of renowned artists, including Indigo Girls, Sierra Ferrell, The Love Language, Elizabeth and the Catapult, Granville Automatic, and The Old Ceremony. the Good Graces dropped debut full-length album Sunset Over Saxapahaw in 2008, followed by several EPs. Next came full-lengths Drawn to You in 2013 and Close to the Sun in 2014, developing a uniquely southern, stripped-down indie style driven by percussive guitar and Ware’s characteristically pure vocal twang. In 2017, Ware teamed up with Atlanta guitarist, songwriter, and producer Jonny Daly to release third full-length Set Your Sights (acclaimed by major music outlets Noisey and No Depression) and 2018’s The Hummingbird EP. Daly also contributed to 2019’s Prose and Consciousness, recorded over a handful of live sessions at The Green House in Atlanta, as the Good Graces’ sound evolved into a more expansive, atmospheric Americana still rooted in simple, acoustic folk.
During the 2020 pandemic, Ware launched two projects designed to connect local artists and friends despite quarantine restrictions: a virtual Facebook venue called “Kimono My House,” which includes members across the world and continues to grow daily, and a podcast called ""Quarantuned With the Good Graces,"" where she interviewed musicians about their creative processes and the need for artists to stay connected.
After sixteen years in Atlanta, Ware recently moved back to Kings Mountain, where she lives in a farmhouse her family has owned for more than a century. “I’m constantly writing songs that reflect this place, and I’m realizing that maybe I’ve always been writing about home in some way or another.” She’s working with NC engineer/producer Jerry Kee (Superchunk, Archers of Loaf, Polvo, Kingsbury Manx, Dex Romweber, Shark Quest) on the Good Graces’ sixth full-length album, exploring “the stuff of home” from the farmhouse and her father’s peach orchard next door: the objects, faces, emotions, and natural features that make a familiar place feel confusing and comforting at the same time."

He has written many songs including the [a=Pink Martini] original ""Mar Desconocido"". 

He has lived and studied in many countries.  When he was two years old, his family moved to the UK. Martín’s musical interest was sparked at a young age by his exposure to South African musicians while living in London, including members of the jazz group District Six, as his mother (dancer  [a=Luciana Proaño]) would take him to rehearsals where he would often fall asleep under the piano.  He began studying piano at age six and later guitar and drums as a teenager.  He is an alumnus of the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston (MA), where he attended on a scholarship and graduated Magna Cum Laude.
 
Having lived in the UK, France, Peru, Spain, and the USA, he speaks and sings in several languages, including English, Spanish, and French.
 
Career
 
He began to formally study drum-set and hand percussion at age thirteen, and his professional music career began at age fifteen in Portland, OR when he met the group [a=Al-Andalus Ensemble] with whom he traveled, performed, and recorded.
 
For over ten years, he performed and contributed to musical arrangements on six albums with the acclaimed group [a=Pink Martini].
One of his original compositions, “Mar Desconocido”, appears on third album [m126639]!

Many other collaborations include working alongside [a=Simon Shaheen], [a=Jamey Haddad], [a=Oscar Stagnaro], [a=Essiet Essiet], [a=Al-Andalus Ensemble], [a=John Butler], [a=Eugene Skeef], [a=Women Of The World], [a=Leo Blanco], [a=Benny Green], [a=Sean Ghazi], [a=Rufus Wainwright], [a=Fared Shafinury], [a=Mario Frangoulis], [a=Dan Gaynor], [a=Edna Vazquez], [a=Mario Diaz], and [a=Dave Eggar], to name just a few.

His solo work has won him several international awards and has been well received among critics, musicians, and audiences alike. Martin's work is inspired by a life of travel, a multicultural upbringing, and the commitment to an open and pluralistic society with equal opportunity for all people.
 
As a producer, he has co-written many songs and produced albums for several other artists.

Between May 17-19, he held three live performances with the title ""El Muro / The wall"" in collaboration with Dana Tai Soon Burgess Dance Company, organized by the Smithonian Institution at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC"

Heinz composed over 130 scores for a wide variety of films. Though best known for music he wrote for exploitation movies, one of his most prestigious collaborations was with Austrian director Franz Antel. Heinz scored Antel's four-part series [i]Der Bockerer,[/i] about a naive Viennese butcher in Nazi Germany.

Initially an indie rock band, their first three records, the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997), and the studio albums Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up (2001), were commercially unsuccessful and were released by the independent labels Electric Honey and Jeepster respectively. The band then signed on to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002.
Snow Patrol rose to national fame with their major label debut, Final Straw, in 2003. The album was certified 5× platinum in the UK and eventually sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Their next studio album, Eyes Open, (2006) and its hit single ""Chasing Cars,"" propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the UK Album Charts and was the best-selling British album of the year, selling over 6 million copies worldwide. In 2008, the band released their fifth studio album A Hundred Million Suns, then in 2009 their first compilation album, Up to Now and in 2011 they released their sixth studio album Fallen Empires.
During the course of their career, Snow Patrol have won five Meteor Ireland Music Awards and have been nominated for three BRIT Awards. Since the release of Final Straw, the band has sold over ten million albums worldwide.

The name is a contradiction in terms, “Violent” being self-explanatory and “Femmes” being Milwaukee slang for wimp.
The rhythm section added high school singer/songwriter Gordon Gano in 1981. Gano and Ritchie had previously performed together at Gano’s National Honor Society induction ceremony, where they caused a near riot. Gano was expelled from the Society and suspended from high school for this outrage. 
One of the only stable aspects of the band is their aversion to rehearsal. Due to this they would take the music to the streets in an attempt to hone it and earn some spare change. It was on one of these occasions that they were spotted by the Pretenders. Chrissie Hynde and the gang were so amused by the Violent Femmes antics that they invited the band to open the show for them. The hometown Milwaukee audience received the Femmes with unanimous booing. However by the end of the set the Femmes had converted approximately 50% of the audience to their cause. Many years later Brian Ritchie encountered Hynde when the Femmes and Pretenders shared the bill at a radio concert. She said, “Oh, you’re still around.”
The Femmes borrowed $10,000 from Victor De Lorenzo’s dad to record their legendary first album in 1982. Slash Records in Los Angeles was the only label to offer them a deal with the amazing advance of $0. The band accepted the deal and started on the predictable round of world tours, recording, more world tours, nervous breakdowns, band members quitting, solo albums, regrouping, more touring, divorces, more crackups, dropped from record deals, new deals, more touring, record company going bankrupt, lawsuits, etc. etc. etc. ad infinitum. 
Fast forward to the present. Many things have changed. One thing that hasn’t is the sound of the band. Their loose, improvisational, acoustic sound is timeless.

Their influences span more than a few decades of loud guitar indie and college rock, including: Guided By Voices, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Teardrop Explodes, Superchunk, Creeper Lagoon and The Lemonheads.

The Big Takeover magazine said of The Pretty Flowers debut album, Why Trains Crash, “These Los Angeles hard power-poppers...play '90s style indie-rock that harkens back to later The Replacements early Weezer, a little Sloan and quite a bit of Wilco.”

On July 14, 2023 the band released their sophomore album, A Company Sleeve, on their new label, Double Helix Records.

Sweet Sweet Music Blog wrote, “A Company Sleeve, featuring twelve incredibly robust compositions, manages to surpass even [Why Trains Crash's] infectious appeal.” Rosy Overdrive wrote, “The album is more than worth this wait–it’s a very strong collection of earnest guitar rock that incorporates bits of slacker rock, jangle pop, college rock, power pop, pop punk, and heartland rock all led charismatically by Green’s clear, everyman vocals.”"

They landed on the name Midnight Choir, taken from the Leonard Cohen song ""Bird On The Wire"".
They recorded their first selftitled album in Texas 1994, heavily influenced by american roots music. In 1996 they met The Walkabout's front man Chris Eckman. And they managed to get him to produce their following albums. Eckman wanted to develop the band into more darker and orchestrated sound, something he managed to do. The band never got serious attention until 'Amsterdam Stranded' was released in 1998, their most selling album in their career. However as the band got further recognition in Norway and Europe, they parted ways in the beginning of 2004 after two more albums to pursue other projects. They released five albums and one Best-of cd during their lifetime.
In March, 2016 they reunited for a sold out Rockefeller in Oslo that followed with a new tour.

A life-long Boston native, he is also known for his activism and humanitarian efforts and was honored in 2008 at the Boston Music Awards as Humanitarian of the Year. Since then he has also worked as a solo artist, releasing both live and studio albums including 2019's Chadwick Stokes & the Pintos.
While attending Middlebury College in the mid-'90s, Stokes formed the indie/roots group Dispatch along with bassist Pete Francis Heimbold and drummer Brad Corrigan. Musically diverse and with a penchant for extended improvisations, Dispatch toured constantly, and their grassroots climb to success was aided by early peer-to-peer file-sharing networks like Napster and LimeWire. By the time they began their 2002 hiatus, they had released four albums and become a major concert draw, all without the assistance of a label. Following Dispatch's massively successful final concert in 2004, Stokes formed another trio called State Radio, whose politically and socially charged songs blended bits of punk, rock, and reggae. Beginning with 2006's Us Against the Crown, the prolific group released two more LPs as well as a handful of EPs and live albums before Stokes made his first solo effort in 2009 with Live at the Brattle Theater.
Upon signing with Nettwerk Records, he made his solo studio debut in 2011 with Simmerkane II, though he continued to record and tour with both State Radio and Dispatch, who reunited briefly in 2007, and again in 2011. Following a series of intimate living-room concerts, Stokes worked with producer Sam Beam (Iron & Wine) to record his second solo album, 2015's The Horse Comanche, for Ruff Shod Records. For his next project, he assembled a backing band called the Pintos to release the politically charged Chadwick Stokes & the Pintos in late 2019. ~ Timothy Monger"

The band had a large fan base in what was sometimes called ""the three Bs"": Boston, Buffalo, and Belgium.
Vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aaron+Perrino]Aaron Perrino[/url] met drummer Shawn Sears in a music theory class at Oneonta State University in New York, and Sears ended up managing Perrino's band the Waverlys. Bass player Jim Gilbert was also a student at Oneonta. The trio three ended up in Boston independently. Waverlys broke up after Perrino moved to Boston, where he formed a new band, the Sheila Divine, with Jim Gilbert and a drummer (name unknown) in 1997. Shawn Sears quickly replaced the original drummer, and three months later, the trio scored a deal with [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Roadrunner+Records+(US)]Roadrunner Records[/url].
An eponymous five-track [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/861005]debut EP[/url] was issued in 1998 to establish the group's name prior to the 1999 release of their full-length debut, [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/701144]The New Parade[/url].
In late 2000, the band was hard at work on their second album when they added [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Colin+Decker]Colin Decker[/url] as a second guitarist to broaden their sound. From 1996 to 2000 Decker was singer/guitarist in a band called Lincolnville (from Portland, Maine). At the time he had a day job as a sound engineer, mastering recordings for labels on a contract basis. He got to know the Sheila Divine when he was involved (although uncredited) in the mastering of the New Parade. Lincolnville broke up in June 2000, citing geographical constraints as the main reason. Decker had been living in Boston for some time and the progress of the band began to suffer as a result of the lengthy commute to Portland. Looking for a new band to play with, and not long after his exposure to the Sheila Divine, Decker was introduced to Jim Gilbert at the Middle East, Boston's legendary Rock club. He and the Sheila Divine got together to play and it clicked right away.
In April of 2001 the Sheila Divine released their second album, [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/671703]Where Have My Countrymen Gone[/url], through the [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Co-op+Pop+Records]Co-Op Pop[/url] imprint. Later that year in August, Shawn Sears left the group to spend more time with his child. Following a handful of shows with fill-ins [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pete+Caldes]Pete Caldes[/url] and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Paul+Buckley]Paul Buckley[/url], drummer Ryan Dolan replaced Sears. Like Colin Decker, Dolan is also a former member of Lincolnville.
Unfortunately, Where Have My Countrymen Gone would prove to be the Sheila Divine's final LP. A six track EP, [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/671706]Secret Society[/url], was released through [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Arena+Rock]Arena Rock Recording Co.[/url] in September 2002. After that they embarked on a non-stop world tour, which would prove to be the band's undoing. While at a show in the mid-west a confrontation with Jim resulted in Aaron throwing his guitar down and announcing to the audience that the band was breaking up. Upon returning home, the band stated on their website they would not break up, but would instead take time off. Aaron Perrino started recording songs in the studio by himself, which would end up on the War Chords EP, the debut release of his new project, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dear+Leader]Dear Leader[/url] (which was intended to be a solo project, but later developed into a new band). The Sheila Divine officially announced their demise on their website in April of 2003, and played two farewell shows in October at The Paradise in Boston.
On December 31, 2005 The Sheila Divine played a reunion show at Bill's Bar in Boston. The band played as a three piece with Aaron, Jim and Ryan.

The group was led by Justin ""Slade The Leveller"" Sullivan (b. 1956, Buckinghamshire, England; guitar, vocals), a former platform sweeper and Mars bar production-line worker, with the help of Stuart Morrow (b. 1966, Bradford, England)  on bass guitar and Phil Tomkins on drums. Within a few months, Tompkins had been replaced on drums by Rob Waddington, and this line-up remained unchanged until the summer of 1982, when Waddington left the band and was replaced by Robert ""Robb"" Heaton (b. 1962, Cheshire, England d. Nov. 4th, 2004), a former drum technician and occasional drummer for the band Hawkwind. This line-up remained together until Morrow left the band for personal reasons, during the band's ""No Rest"" tour, the day after a concert in their home town of Bradford. Which was coincidentally the day of the Bradford disaster, May 11th, 1985  He was replaced on bass in the summer by Jason ""Moose"" Harris (b. 1968).

Their brand of punk folk/rock attracted a loyal cult following, much of which shared the band's grievances towards the Tory government policies of the 80s. This was best executed on their debut album, which combined militant themes such as ""Spirit Of The Falklands"" and ""Vengeance"" (a vitriolic anthem about getting even with one's trespassers) with the haunting lament for childhood, ""A Liberal Education"". The group's championing of traditional working-class ethics saw an unexpected boost for a dying art and trade - that of the clog.

New Model Army made their first public appearance at Scamps Disco in Bradford in October 1980. After releasing singles on Abstract Records, enjoying a number 2 UK independent chart hit with ""The Price"" in 1984, they formed an unlikely alliance with the multinational EMI Records, which saw the band acquire a higher profile and a significantly increased recording budget. 

They eventually broke through to a wider audience with ""No Rest"", which peaked at number 28 on the UK singles chart in 1985 - a position they were never to beat in an impressive run of 12 UK chart singles between 1985 and 1991. With often inflammatory lyrics, the band have never compromised their beliefs for commercial gain. 

They ran into trouble with BBC Television's Top Of The Pops show for donning T-shirts with the (albeit laudable) slogan, ""Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin"". This attracted some derision from ""anarcho-punk"" traditionalists [a251960], who replied with their own motif: ""Only Stupid Bastards Help EMI"". They subsequently continued to release high-quality albums, with considerable crossover potential, always maintaining credibility with their original fanbase. 

In December 1991 the group left EMI, eventually finding a new home on Epic Records. Their first single for the label revealed few concessions to the mainstream: ""Here Comes The War"" featured a picture of a charred body, and a pull-out poster instructing the user in how to prepare a nuclear bomb. In 1994, a dance remix of ""Vengeance' was released as a protest against the Criminal Justice Bill. After a lengthy absence the band reconvened for 1998's ""Strange Brotherhood"". New Model Army's short spell with Epic ended as quickly as it started with the band preferring to self publish and go back to their roots. By 2000 their most recent studio album was ready. Named ""Eight"" it included a now familiar, though no less effective, formula and energy. They continue to release new material and tour as of 2023."

Years later, Keith retrieved the files from his ancient laptop and got them mixed by Mat Halliday (Empire! Empire!, Fireworks) and mastered by Dave Downham (Beach Slang, Into It! Over It!) to give the album a proper release.

Anna Flyaway fills a missing gap for Empire! Empire! listeners but will also find a home with a new audience as the songs still feel fresh, 14 years later. For fans of early Death Cab for Cutie, Mineral, and Minus the Bear. - Taken from Count Your Lucky Stars Records"

They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

From an impromptu jam, in early January 2009 at Jack White's Third Man studio in Nashville, the foursome found common ground and began writing, composing and laying down recordings 'on the fly'. The outcome was the band ""The Dead Weather "" and the album ""Horehound"", representing one of the brightest and most refreshing events in the musical history of 2009.

Alison 'VV' Mosshart, [ex ""Discount""] and still part of ""The Kills"" duo, provides lead vocals, backing guitar, percussion and her compositional style and delivery to many of the band's lyrics,

Dean Fertita, [ex ""Waxwings"" and ""Queens Of The Stone Age""] brings his multi-instrumentalist skills to bear on guitar, bass, organ, piano, synth and backing vocals.

Jack Lawrence, [ex ""Do-Whaters"" and 'floating' member of ""The Greenhornes"",  ""Blanche"" and ""The Raconteurs""] provides bass, guitar, drums and backing vocals.

Jack White, aka Jack White III, [""The White Stripes"" & ""The Raconteurs""] plays drums, provides lead and backing vocals, and plays his unmistakable style of lead guitar. Born ""John Gillis"", White began work in the upholstery trade, forming his first two-piece band ""Two Part Resin"", later renamed ""The Upholsterers"" after a career he would leave behind. He was then a member of ""Goober & The Peas"", Two-Star Tabernacle"" and ""The Henchmen"" before morphing into the persona of Jack White of ""The White Stripes"". After the success of ""The White Stripes"" as a 2-piece, with his wife Meg on drums [who's surname he adopted], White was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as 17th in their list of ""Greatest Guitarists Of All Time"".

""The Dead Weather"" band debut was a performance at ""Third Man"" HQ in Nashville on the 11th March 2009, followed by the single ""Hang You From The Heavens"" released from the ""Horehound"" album. The album was released on 13th July 2009 in Europe and the following day in North America, with 3 tracks made available as downloads for the ""Rock Band"" video game. The 3 tracks were ""Hang You From The Heavens"", ""No Hassle Night"" and ""Treat Me Like Your Mother"". In October 2009 the band released a further single ""I Cut Like A Buffalo"", accompanied by a cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band song ""A Child Of A Few Hours Is Burning To Death"". The single was also available bundled with 2 live tracks ""Bone House"" & ""Hang You From The Heavens"". During 2009 the band appeared on ""The Culture Show"" & ""Later, With Jools Holland"" on UK TV.

At the close of 2009 the band were close to completion of a follow-up album and will be touring the Pacific in March 2010, taking in Australia, New Zealand & Japan. By mid-January 2010 a documentary DVD will be available worldwide titled ""It Might Get Loud"" featuring the guitarists Jack White [""Fly Farm Blues""], Jimmy Page & The Edge."

Though he had been making music for years under the name Spark Alaska and a multitude of high school bands, the franticness and earnest expression being put on display in these upstate basements and attics was infectious.

In late 2014, Cook brought the first Petite League demo of friend and drummer Henry Schoonmaker, and the rest is history. Since then, the two have recorded two albums (Slugger and No Hitter), garnered press from Pitchfork, the Fader, Noisey, etc. , co-founded the notable Syracuse DIY venue Scarier Dome, and now reside in Ridgewood, Queens post-graduation.

This bring us to present day, and the band’s the third record, Rips One Into the Night. Blending the sweet, bubblegum qualities of bedroom pop and the snot nosed fuzz of garage rock, Rips One Into the Night is Petite League fully-formed. Coming in at 10 tracks, Rips One Into the Night will be released on September 1st by The Native Sound and the band’s own Scarier Dome label."
