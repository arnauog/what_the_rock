The following year the Driller Killer EP was released, featuring three new tracks that would eventually end up on the bands second album, Tomb of the Eagles, which was released in 2011. While recording this album the band started working on their first concept album, Demonic Dinner Dance. Taking inspiration from the days of vinyl, this album featured two pieces of music, a side A & side B. Each piece was made up of several individual songs that segued into each other with the lyrics exploring the story of a fictional Dinner Dance. Before its release in 2014 the band previewed two songs from it as part of 2012’s EP, High Maintenance Girlfriend, which also contained two exclusive tracks and two remixed songs from the bands earlier albums. Another release bridging the gap between the Eagles and Demonic albums was the digital only single, Just When I Wasn’t Lookin’ which featured a guest vocal from [a=Martin Jakubski] the singer with StillMarillion, Maiden Scotland and occasional guest with [a=The Steve Rothery Band].

2018 saw the release of the album, Work Work Work, a new set of tracks from the band revolving around the lyrical theme of the working day. It was preceded in December of 2017 by the single I Belong. A companion album, Another Day at the Office, is currently being worked on, with one track from it, The List, a reworking of the Work Work Work song, Last Train from Hell, having already been released on the digital single Book Bus in 2016.

Born December 10, 1965 in Amherst, Massachusetts, he first emerged as a member of the hardcore unit Deep Wound, founding Dinosaur in 1984. Over the course of acclaimed LPs like 1987's You're Living All Over Me and 1988's Bug, the group emerged among the most highly regarded in alternative rock, with [b]J Mascis[/b]' creaky, [a=Neil Young]-like vocals and monolithic guitar leads becoming primary influences on the burgeoning grunge movement. The group temporarily disbanded in 1989, largely to allow the legendarily non-communicative singer the opportunity to dismiss bassist [a=Lou Barlow], who went on to form [a=Sebadoh]; in the meantime, [b]J Mascis[/b] sat in on drums with a series of bands, among them [a154053] and GobbleHoof, even producing the latter's eponymous 1990 LP. Upon re-forming Dinosaur Jr. in 1991, he scored Allison Anders' independent film Gas Food Lodging a year later, making a cameo appearance in the picture itself; he and Anders became regular collaborators in the years to follow, most notably on her feature Grace of My Heart. In the meantime, [b]J Mascis[/b] also produced records for pals including fIREHOSE (Mr. Machinery Operator) and Tad (Inhaler), and in 1996 issued his solo debut Martin and Me. After 1997's Hand It Over, Dinosaur Jr. disbanded. Keeping on with his personal musical eclecticism, [b]J Mascis[/b] and his new outfit [a293242] issued More Light in fall 2000. Featuring appearances from avant garde guitarist [a=Kevin Shields] and [a=Guided By Voices] vocalist Bob Pollard, the record was a fine return to form that excited Dinosaur Jr. fans who had been disappointed with his acoustic record. A tour with Elf Power followed, featuring longtime friend [a=Mike Watt] on bass and [a39770] guitarist Ron Asheton at several tour dates. It was his riff-heavy jams with Asheton and Watt that inspired much of the music he started writing for his follow-up, as well as several skydiving experiences. When he stepped back into the studio, he kept the guest appearances down to a minimum and recorded Feel So Free for a 2002 release. DInosaur Jr. reformed with its original lineup in 2005, and have released 4 studio albums since."

He lacked apparent heir when he died, which made him the subject of BBC programme [url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1046552]H£ir Hunt£rs[/url] in November 2011, where investigators look for descendants of deceased people who did not leave a will.

His main claim to fame was his 1966 version of 'Hey Joe' by [a=Billy Roberts]. [a=Jimi Hendrix] had seen him perform at [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Wha%3F]Café Wha?[/url] in New York City, and got a huge hit in 1966 with a similar, slower (but heavier...) version (bands like [a=The Byrds], [a=Love] and [a=The Surfaris] had already made faster versions of it). Until his death, he claimed he actually wrote it after having heard it as a ""traditional"" in Florida as a boy, but as of 2009 there is no proof whatsoever he is right. He might have confused it with country artist [a=Carl Smith]s 1953 country hit by the same name, written by [a=Boudleaux Bryant] of American pop/country duo [a739931] ([a=Felice Bryant] and husband Boudleaux Bryant).

He also had a hit with Canadian folk singer [a=Bonnie Dobson]'s 'Morning Dew' in 1967 (once more claiming songwriting credit due to his ""harder"" arrangement...), which became a hit with hardrocking Scotsmen [a=Nazareth] in 1972 ([m1047486]), pulled from their 1971 eponymously titled debut album ([m24564]).

[a=Nick Cave] covered his 'Long Time Man' on his 1986 album [m17242].

Years active: 1960s to1978, 1986-2002

From the official website:
------------------------------------
Darkflight started in the year 2000, creating a mix of blackened doom metal with fantasy influenced lyrics. In the beginning of 2002, the debut demo ""Obscure"" was completed, with the demo's concept inspired by Adam Nichols's fantasy book, ""The War Of The Lords Veil"". The label Totentroll (Rage of Achilles subsidiary), who specialized in releasing 7"" vinyls of fantasy metal, proposed to release two of the demo tracks as an EP single called ""Alone Somewhere Beyond"". Meanwhile, Darkflight recorded the album ""Under The Shadow Of Fear"" and attracted the attention of the main label. They both decided to focus on releasing a full length and the 7"" EP single was cancelled. The band signed a 2 album record deal, and the album was released on June 30th, 2003.

Darkflight started recordings for the next album called ""The Northern Campaign"". In the middle of 2004, Rage of Achilles announced that it would cease to exist due to financial problems. The band used some of the unfinished album tracks and released an online Promo, while searching for a new label.

A few labels contacted the band during that time and while Darkflight didn't have enough material for a second full length, they decided to join in a split album with another band. Together, Oak Knoll Productions and Konklav Records planned a split release with the French band Ars Moriendi. Unfortunately, Oak Knoll Productions couldn't handle the manufacturing costs, as well as having very serious financial problems, resulting in the canceling of the CD.

During 2007 year the band released the 3rd demo called ""Distant Pain"" and immediately caught the attention of the US based label Ars Magna Recordings. Recording sessions took place in the winter of 2007 and the second full length album named ""Perfectly Calm"" was completed, containing some new songs, the ""Distant Pain"" demo and two of the tracks from the unreleased split album. The album was released on the 6th of June 2008 and contains 8 tracks of nearly 60 minutes of playing time. Currently the band is working on a new full length album with the temporary title ""Closure"".

Back in 1988, Martin M. (guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, voices) and Radar Dave (guitars, voices) - who had formed a band called Moonstone, playing Hawkwind covers and original material - were inspired by Nik Turner's 'Watching The Grass Grow' to be more immersed in space rock scene. They recruited Mr. Dibs (bass) and Floyd (keyboards, synths) for the organization of a new space rock band Purple Otter Trotters, playing a gig for the Traveller's Aid Trust in Manchester and releasing a tape titled Mike Moorcock's Underpants, a creditable collection of Hawkwind covers. In the next year the band was reborn as KREL, with the addition of a new drummer Mike Man.

KREL made a great effort into gigging around Stockport and Manchester to promote their self-produced debut cassette 'Who's Next On This', and gained fame with their live performances or as a competent supporter for the famous space rock outfits, including gigs with Ozric Tentacles in Manchester and Wolverhampton. Asked to play a couple of support slots for Hawkwind at Bradford and York as a small taster for the British spring 1992 tour, KREL continued to gig locally as well as playing at a Club Dog event in London. They spent next few months rehearsing as well as recording lots of materials for the next cassette album 'Dark Star', which was released to accompany the British tour with Hawkwind. Over 45,000 people could get enthusiastic over KREL's performances with their original audio-visual system.

In May 1993, the next cassette album 'Earth Zero' could achieve high levels of interest, particularly in Europe. Although Mike Man was replaced by Gibo as a drummer, KREL could keep active and accept the invitation to support the Enid for charity gigs of National Association for Bikers with a Disability (NABD). In 1995, after Mr. Dibs' leaving the band for the formation of Spacehead, KREL recorded the excellent 'About Time (to Emit)' tape, almost a solo work by Martin M. and exactly the basis of their debut CD. 'About Time (to Emit)' was reworked & polished into a complete work 'As Astra', that was approved and released in 1996 by Dead Earnest label.

Nothing has been heard from KREL around the new millennium but Dead Earnest had planned to release a compilation CD of the remastered tracks from the previous cassette-only works. In 2003 Dead Earnest decided to ask Martin for releasing KREL's new album. This request was not his pleasure, but eventually their new work - consisting of tracks from the unreleased 1992 Shed Studio sessions, live tracks from their tour opening for Hawkwind in 1992, plus newer material - 'Out Of Space' was released in 2004."

Original members chosen for the perilous path by the very gods themselves were : WAYNE FIREFLY - Vocals and Bass, smokin' JAMES FLAMES - Guitar, IAN MAIDEN - Guitar, NICK FERATU - Drums. Playing their first show in November 1999 led onto a hard, constant year round touring schedule, sometimes putting 1000 miles a week on the van. This included Ireland, Europe, countless appearances on the Holidays In The Sun / Wasted festivals and tentative plans were made to attack the U.S.A.
Having played shows with such luminaries as Suicidal Tendencies, Poison Idea, D.R.I., Stiff Little Fingers, Conflict, G.B.H. U.K. Subs, Leftover Crack, Capdown, the Subhumans, Funeral for a Friend, the Wildhearts, the Vibrators, Vice Squad and the Damned to name a few, and with the release of their first album (CAN YOUR PUNY BODY SURVIVE?)) in 2001 on their own INFRA BLACK RECORDS, led to signing with popular punk / ska label GOOD CLEAN FUN RECORDS in 2002.
This unholy alliance led to the release of their second album (THE INCREDIBLE, UNSTOPPABLE TITAN OF TERROR) in 2003.
Since a split of the original lineup in June 2005 put the brakes on for a few months, and taking a few months of rethinking and rebuilding, remaining original founding member Wayne Firefly put another line up together to carry on the sonic slaughter. Finding new members, HARRY KARI and LAZ VEGAS, who took over guitars and drums respectively. Now down to a three piece during this period, the search was on for a second guitarist but to no avail.
The release of their third album entitled, ""PAIN IS ONLY TEMPORARY,GLORY LASTS FOREVER"", was December 2007. Put out again by their own INFRABLACK RECORDS label. November '08 saw the departure of drummer Laz Vegas. December '08 saw the arrival of TINMAN, (ex Instant Agony drummer.)
In November 2009, STUNTFACE took on another guitarist putting the line-up back to the preferred four piece. This character was known as STE FLAT BACK and is a veteran of his own pop punk band Flat Back Four.
STUNTFACE were no more in June 2010. Sometimes, you just have to know when to quit. Ironically after demoing 12 tracks for a 4th STUNTFACE album.. these demos still exist somewhere. That album was going to be called EL CASA DEL DIABLO if it ever saw the light of day.

John Christoforou) and drummer Milan Zekavica. 

The seeds for the formation of The Escape Club were sown when Zekavica joined Steel and Holliday in Mad Shadows, who subsequently performed on an album by the obscure early 1980s Stephen Milford-fronted new wave outfit Planning by Numbers.

Before long, Christo had also joined the lineup, and The Escape Club was born and the fledgling band quickly released the single ""Breathing"".

In 1985 The Escape Club signed with EMI and recorded the album White Fields, which was released the following year. 

In 1987, the group moved to Atlantic Records and began recording their next album, Wild Wild West, and the album was released in the summer of 1988 and spawned the single ""Wild, Wild West"", which climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart while the song's video received major rotation on MTV, however, it was banned from British Television for unclear reasons.

In 1989, they released two more singles from Wild Wild West: ""Shake for the Sheik"", which climbed to No. 28, and ""Walking Through Walls"", which peaked at No. 81.

The Escape Club's cover single of The Doors' ""20th Century Fox"" appeared on The Wonder Years: Music From the Emmy Award-Winning Show & Its Era, which also received airplay on MTV. The song was produced by Doors band member Ray Manzarek.

In 1990 the band returned to the studio to record their final album, Dollars and Sex, which saw a March 1991 release. The first single, ""Call It Poison"", failed to crack the US Top 40. 

Atlantic Records then released the song ""I'll Be There"", which the group said was heavily influenced by the death of a friend's wife, and the song has become an anthem among those who have experienced losses of their own. 

""I'll Be There"" reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and achieved gold status in the US.The group disbanded in 1992. 

The Escape Club is the only British band to have a No. 1 hit in the U.S. while not charting at all in their native UK.

The band self-released a fourth album ""Cloud 10"" in 2005.

Trevor Steel and John Holliday reunited, with new band member Red Broad, in 2009 and self-released a fifth studio album, Celebrity, in February 2012.

In 2019, Johnnie Christo returned to the line-up and the Escape Club played as a full band for the first time in 25 years during the U.S. tour Lost 80s Live. "

Three young brothers performing real 1950's Rockabilly music just how it
was originally intended to be - Raw, Savage and full of youthful energy!

Despite their ages (which even when combined, still add up to less than
that of many artists performing on the Rock 'n' Roll & Rockabilly scene)
Gordon, Tom and David Doel already have a wealth of experience playing real
rockin' music. In their school years, they became well know performing
under the name Schoolhouse Rock - regularly gigging, making radio
appearances and having tracks released on Fury Records. Highlights for the
trio included appearing alongside Rockabilly legends Ray Campi and Sonny
George. Schoolhouse Rock performed raw and wild rockabilly, in a league
with the more senior bands of the scene, but party because of their young
ages, and partly because of their name, were sometimes considered something
of a novelty band.

After a short break from performing as a live band, the Doel Brothers
re-invented themselves as The Young Savages, a name which far better suits
their untamed style of Raw Rockabilly, and immediately started to be taken
more seriously. Already they have signed a management deal and been
snapped up by specialist Rockabilly label Raucous Records. Their debut
album is fittingly titled 'Untamed' (RAUCD 114) and is produced by
Rockabilly heavyweights Boz Boorer (The Polecats) and Ian Speller (Rusti
Steel & The Tintax) both of whom also make guest appearances as
musicians. 'Untamed' features eleven full-throttle blasts, with nine
originals and two carefully chosen covers from Rockabilly Music's rich history."

Formed not long after the last of the millennium fireworks went off, this big bunch of strays were not permitted into the local pets hotel as their honking V-8 engine was just too much for the bluebird, buzzard and the oriole at all hours of the day, and so commenced their journey spreading the rock-a-beatin’ boogie throughout the land. They found a base at the Ritz Ballroom, Brighouse, stopping off and having fun with the lovely folks at ‘The Swing Cats Ball’ / Stockport, ‘Vegas’ / Edinburgh, Colne Rhythm’n’Blues and Burnley Blues festivals and not to mention of course some marvellous guest houses hosted by the warm and welcoming landlord’s / landlady’s at The Primrose / Leeds, The Wardrobe / Leeds and Batley Variety Club / eh, Batley… A very kind man one day dug these cats ‘n’ kittens so much that he exchanged the saucers of milk for other round shiny things called compact discs and ‘Everybody Wants To Be A Cat’ in 2003 and ‘It Aint What You Do’ in 2005 on Raucous Records managed to get the ‘me-oww’ to other felines in far-flung places like Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and even Japan – places our master, Dick Whittington, never ever mentioned on the map to London so that was a nice surprise. And another very kind group of guys ‘n’ gals gave The Cat Pack an award at the 2002 BBC Big Band competition and that sits very proudly on the really high shelf at our master, Dick Whittington’s first home because any of the lower shelves he knows it’ll get knocked down when we’re jumping around waiting for our tea.
So amongst also sleeping a lot, curling up in a ball, doing that funny hunched-back, side-stepping jumpy thing cats do now and again, The Cat Pack discovered many other cat-lovers who were really nice to us with lots of strokes and tickles under the chin at companies like Pfizer, Sainsburys, The National Railway Museum, The Royal Armouries and Bristol Evening News; weddings, functions and charities at smashing places like Longleat House / Bath, Majestic Hotel / Harrogate, Gateshead Stadium and Aldborough Manor / North Yorkshire; and some really fun journeys at places like where our master, Dick Whittington, works a lot – Blackpool Opera House, Oldham Coliseum, Bristol Colston Hall, Halifax Victoria theatre and Leeds City Varieties – not to mention supporting two of the real original hep-cats, Little Richard and Chuck Berry when they too were wandering around the UK.
And finally, we’re dead lucky to have some of the coolest, caring, cuddly and cute cats in the world amongst the ranks. Saxophonists, Trombonists, Trumpeters, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, Vocalists; loads of very talented performers of the highest professional calibre who have also been on trips with hep-cats ‘n’ kittens like Joe Longthorne, Peter Grant, Georgie Fame, Corrine Bailey Rae, Amy Winehouse, The Drifters, Diane Schure, The Stranglers, Roy Wood, Michael Roach, BBC Big Band, Syd Lawrence Orchestra, Pasadena Roof Orchestra, Squadronaires, NYJO; shows including The Rat Pack live from Las Vegas, Chicago and Legends Reborn; venues most notably at the London Palladium, Royal Albert Hall and many UK Arenas, plus countless TV / Radio sessions, cruise ships, summer seasons and pantomimes (where we obviously met our master, Dick Whittington………)

Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song 'The Small Hours' from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine.

In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the name [a=Hologram (8)]. Mortimer retained the name Holocaust. A sticker on the cover of Hologram's only album, [url=https://www.discogs.com/Hologram-Steal-The-Stars/release/3111675]Steal The Stars[/url] stated that Holocaust was now Hologram.

The band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, 1997's Covenant and 2000's The Courage To Be. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves as well as the full-length record ""Primal"". In 2013 John Mortimer gathered the Primal-line-up for the yet-to-be-released ""Sweet Liberty"", touring heavily and releasing a digital EP called ""Expander""."

Three young brothers performing real 1950's Rockabilly music just how it
was originally intended to be - Raw, Savage and full of youthful energy!

Despite their ages (which even when combined, still add up to less than
that of many artists performing on the Rock 'n' Roll & Rockabilly scene)
Gordon, Tom and David Doel already have a wealth of experience playing real
rockin' music. In their school years, they became well know performing
under the name Schoolhouse Rock - regularly gigging, making radio
appearances and having tracks released on Fury Records. Highlights for the
trio included appearing alongside Rockabilly legends Ray Campi and Sonny
George. Schoolhouse Rock performed raw and wild rockabilly, in a league
with the more senior bands of the scene, but party because of their young
ages, and partly because of their name, were sometimes considered something
of a novelty band.

After a short break from performing as a live band, the Doel Brothers
re-invented themselves as The Young Savages, a name which far better suits
their untamed style of Raw Rockabilly, and immediately started to be taken
more seriously. Already they have signed a management deal and been
snapped up by specialist Rockabilly label Raucous Records. Their debut
album is fittingly titled 'Untamed' (RAUCD 114) and is produced by
Rockabilly heavyweights Boz Boorer (The Polecats) and Ian Speller (Rusti
Steel & The Tintax) both of whom also make guest appearances as
musicians. 'Untamed' features eleven full-throttle blasts, with nine
originals and two carefully chosen covers from Rockabilly Music's rich history."

As a child he learnt to play the piano, recorder, violin, harmonium, before moving on to the guitar. In November 1963, he joined his first band called [i]The Mariners[/i], aged 17. They were followed by [i]The Crestas[/i], whom he left in 1965 and moved to London. There he joined [a=The Voice (8)], but this proved untimely as they were disbanded a short time later. Next was a soul band called [i]The Wanted[/i], but this was also short-lived and he moved back to Hull.

In 1966, he joined [i]The Rats[/i] who changed their name to [i]Treacle[/i] in 1968. Then in 1970 he was asked to join the [a=David Bowie] backing band [i]The Hype[/i], and on 5th February 1970 he made his debut for Bowie playing on his Peel Sessions, recorded for the BBC's Radio 1. The backing band began to record their own music and would go on to release in their own right. Ronson also started to work with Bowie on the arrangements, as well as arranging and producing for other artists. He ceased working with David Bowie in 1973, and began concentrating on his solo work and producing. He was for a short time a member of [a=Mott The Hoople] and had a band called [a=The Hunter Ronson Band] with [a=Ian Hunter].

Though he died in London, he was buried in Eastern Cemetery in his hometown.

Previously the guitarist in garage band [a=The Go], Jack White's musical output in this fused twosome was heavily laced with folk blues, country, 60s Britpop and Broadway show tunes. Dressed in minimalist red and white outfits, the Stripes' striking stage presence was allied to their undeniable grasp of the rudiments of timeless rock music. Their debut was the 1997 single ""Let's Shake Hands"", followed by ""Lafayette Blues"" [[l105510]]. They then moved to the label [l13828] and began to receive acclaim for their act and eponymous [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-The-White-Stripes/master/10338]1st album[/url], mixing astute cover versions ([a=Robert Johnson]'s ""Stop Breaking Down Blues"" and [a=Josh White]'s ""St. James Infirmary"") with some devastating originals.

By the time of the following year's [url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-De-Stijl/master/399]De Stijl[/url] [The Style], the media buzz surrounding the White Stripes had reached new heights. Of particular note was the duo's reception in the UK, where their music was lauded in national media, including [i]The Daily Telegraph, The Sun[/i] and even Radio 4's [i]Today[/i] programme - not normally known for its liberal music policy. The influential John Peel was quoted as comparing their importance to that of Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols - although both those acts were originators, whereas the Whites clearly powerful interpreters. They certainly dispelled any question of hype, upon release of a third album, ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-White-Blood-Cells/master/10332]White Blood Cells[/url]"", followed by ""[url=http://www.discogs.com/White-Stripes-Elephant/master/10341]Elephant[/url]"" in 2003. The latter recorded at London's tiny Toe Rag Studios, using pre-60s analogue equipment and only eight tracks. Produced by Jack White, the highly-successful album offered a contrast to the digital conformity of music emerging in the new millennium, reaching the top-ten in the US & going platinum in the UK.

This track was reworked and renamed 'Carrion' which became their first UK Top 40 single in 2003. That year saw the release of their debut album 'The Decline of British Sea Power' on the Rough Trade label.
Their sophomore effort 'Open Season' was released in 2005 and spawned their first UK Top 20 single 'It Ended on an Oily Stage'. Three years later, in 2008, their third effort 'Do You Like Rock Music?' earned the band a coveted Mercury Music Prize nomination. The band, now a six-piece, released fourth album 'Valhall Dancehall' in early 2011.
