Beginning with their 1968 debut album they broke tradition by using classical music instruments in rock songs and rock instruments in classical pieces. This fusion, daring at the time, impressed legendary conductor [a=Leonard Bernstein] so much that he invited the group to appear at one of his Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra where they performed their signature song ""Brandenburg"", based on the first movement of Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto.

Brandenburg appeared on the group's second LP ""Faithful Friends"" (1969). This LP had higher production values than their first and contained many of the songs that were part of their live act.  Their third album, ""Reflections"" (1970), was actually recorded prior to Faithful Friends and was a collaboration with Greek composer [a=Manos Hadjidakis] on the score for a film that was never produced.  Rhythm guitarist Brian Corrigan departed after the third album and after being part of the only movie appearance by the group, ""Zachariah"".

The band then shortened its name to The New York Rock Ensemble and switched to Columbia Records.  Roll Over (1971) was their most overtly rock album and, at that time, their biggest seller.  Their album Freedomburger (1972) was an uneven collection of songs. Soon after the tour supporting this album the band dispersed.  Kamen, joined by Rudnytsky and other musicians, gave it one last try when they released New York Rock in 1973."

Many of Italian music fans know the name of the Capsicum Red only because their singer and guitarist Red Canzian has had a career of great success with the Pooh, and in fact these four musicians from Treviso did not attract a lot of interest during the short life of their group.

The name Capsicum Red was chosen by the producer Pino Massara when he discovered Canzian, singer and guitarist of the Prototypes, and took him to the new label Bla Bla in 1970. To attract the interest of the press, the Capsicum Red were presented as a foreign group, and this caused some success for the first two 45 rpm.
The first single was recorded by Ocean Canzian with studio musicians and had some popularity, due to the fact that it was used as the theme song of the TV program, ... and I'll tell you who you are. Another 45 laps, Tarzan, came soon after, recorded in London with the musicians of the band Stone the Crows, but did not have the same success of the previous year.
Both 45s contained commercial songs far away from the next album, and both were later included in the rare collection Tarzan, published by Bla Bla in 1972.

To accompany Canzian in live performance were then selected some of the musicians Treviso: the first line-up included Canzian, Bolzan, drummer and bassist Paul Podda Valter Gasparini, now replaced by Steffan. Once again the label communication strategies tried to create interest for the group: a Canzian is said that he was born to an Italian father in England and had started playing in that country, and that the group was formed in London, where the young musicians had met and had held their first concerts.

In 1972, with new member Roberto Balocco coming from Cold Cream, the group shifted decisively with the LP Notes for an obsession towards progressive music, with strong classical influences.
The first side contains the long Pathetique suites derived from Beethoven, an interesting piece of symphonic prog with keyboards in evidence. The second front is on a lower level with three shorter songs that in some cases seem weaker.

The group disbanded in 1973, when Red Canzian went for a short time in Osage Tribe and then the Pooh, and Paul Steffan formed the country-inspired duo Genova & Steffan releasing an album in 1975."

Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013.

He is a well known country rock performer, writer and co-writer of hit songs for other artists, most famously Linda Ronstadt and association of the Eagles band. He was married to [a=Alexandra Sliwin] from 1969-1972.

Souther was greatly influenced by Texan Roy Orbison, whose sound he tried to emulate. Following his move to Los Angeles in the late 1960s, he met a young guitarist from Detroit named Glenn Frey. They bonded over their Detroit roots and a common love of country and R&B music. In short order, they began working together while sharing a small apartment in Los Angeles' Echo Park area (their downstairs neighbor was Jackson Browne with whom both Souther and Frey would collaborate on numerous projects).

Shortly after meeting, Souther and Frey formed a folk duo called Longbranch Pennywhistle. Their lone album, released in 1970 on Jimmy Bowen's Amos Records, featured significant contributions from guitarists James Burton and Ry Cooder, fiddler Doug Kershaw, drummer Jim Gordon, pianist Larry Knechtel and bassist Joe Osborn.

After recording an eponymous solo album in 1972, persuaded by David Geffen, Souther teamed up with Chris Hillman and Richie Furay to form the Souther Hillman Furay Band The group released two albums, but creative tensions and lack of record sales (not to mention Furay's discomfort with playing secular music following his conversion to Christianity) led to the band's demise.

Souther is probably best known for his well-crafted songwriting abilities, especially in the field of country rock. He co-wrote some of the biggest hits for the Eagles, including ""Best of My Love"", ""Victim of Love"", ""Heartache Tonight"", and ""New Kid in Town"". ""How Long"", which appears on the Eagles Long Road Out Of Eden was written by Souther and originally recorded on his first solo album in 1972. He also produced Linda Ronstadt's ""Don't Cry Now"" album, and wrote songs for several of Ronstadt's multi-platinum albums, including ""Faithless Love"" from Heart Like a Wheel and ""White Rhythm and Blues"" included in her Living in the USA album. He also recorded several notable duets with Ronstadt, including ""Hasten Down the Wind,"" ""Prisoner in Disguise,"" and ""Sometimes You Can't Win."" He wrote ""Run Like a Thief,"" which appeared on Home Plate by Bonnie Raitt.

Souther has also contributed as a singer in works written by other artists, including backing vocals with Don Henley in ""The Light Is On"" by Christopher Cross on his eponymous debut album.

His biggest hit as a solo artist was his 1979 Orbison-influenced song ""You're Only Lonely"" from the album of the same name, which reached number 7 on the Billboard charts. A collaboration with James Taylor called ""Her Town Too"" from Taylor's Dad Loves His Work album reached number 11 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.

He was a contributor on the Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night 1987 concert and video, sang The Platters' ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" in the 1989 movie Always and sang the theme song to the 1989-1992 sitcom Anything But Love.

On October 14, 2008 Souther released If the World Was You, his first new release in 25 years. In the Fall of 2009, Souther released a follow up live CD entitled Rain - Live at the Belcourt Theatre, featuring a blend of old and new material.

As an actor, he has played several roles, including the character of John Dunaway in the (1989–1990) third season of the television drama thirtysomething and Ted in the film Postcards from the Edge (1990). He also performs in the audio book genre including the recent Jimmy Buffett sequel to Tales from Margaritaville, A Salty Piece of Land. He played Jesse James in the Television movie ""Purgatory"" in 1999. He was also Jeffrey Pommeroy in ""My Girl 2""."

After a short period of time, the line-up was changed, Weathers and Williams left, replaced by [a2067822] (Guitar and Voice) and [a=Jeff Jones (2)] (Drums). This line-up features the album ""Battle Hymn"" on [l=Chrysalis Music], dated 1971 in Hard-Rock style with Progressive and Blues-Rock veins. The electric guitar and vocals are the protagonists, supported by a solid rhythm section and the record alternates more pushed tracks with other more melodic. The feedback is positive for both critics and audiences, thanks in part to their excellent live performances supporting bands such as Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, Procol Harum, Yes, Ten Years After and Zz Top. Despite the success of the first album and the live band changed again, Blackmore left the group replaced by [a=Mick Dyche] (Slide Guitar, Guitar and vocals) and [a=Steve Gurl] (Piano) added to the five. The sextet released a single called ""Good old days"", containing an unreleased B-side: ""Life Is a Symphony"", before the album ""Turkey"" also in 1972, in the hope of confirming and improving the success of the first work, but it was not so. The record is less incisive than the previous one, despite the excellent technical skills of the musicians and the addition of keyboards, they churn out a good record but that has a lesser impact than the pfirst. After a couple of years without any new record production and having had other changes in the line-up, [a=Bernie Marsden] (Guitar) replaces Dyche and [a=Kevin Currie] (Drums) takes Jones's place and in the mid of 1974 Wild Turkey disband, each member takes different musical path. Until 1996, when [a=Glenn Cornick], supported by the band's historical members, give Life at the Wild Turkey's second era, reforming the group and recording the third album 22 years after their dissolution. The reunion of ""Stealer of Years"" on [l=HTD Records] involves: [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica), [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass, Mandolin, Penny Whistle), [a=Tweke Lewis] (Electric guitar and acoustics, Backing Vocals), [a=Brian Thomas (25)] (Drums) and [a=Lee Morris (10)] (Keyboards) as guest. The sound differs from the 70s Turkey, oriented more towards blues-rock than the hard-rock of the first records. Well arranged and performed, more melodic tracks alternate with others more in the Rock vein for a pleasant return on the scene. The band seems to be ready to walk the stage again, instead the following studio album takes another 10 years, during which only two albums containing live recordings from the previous period are released: ""Final Performance"" in 2000 and ""Live in Edinburgh"" in 2001 by [l=Audio Archives] label. In 2002, a collection containing a repertoire of studio recordings from the 1970s was released by the same label. In 2006 they came out ""You & Me In The Jungle"" produced on [l=Wild Turkey Music Ltd] and the artists involved are: [a=Glenn Cornick] (Bass), [a=Gary Pickford-Hopkins] (Vocals, Harmonic), [a=Mick Dyche] (Guitar, Bass, Voice), [a=Steve Gurl] (Keyboards), [a=Clive Bunker] (Drums), Graham Williams (Guitar), [a=John Weathers] (Percussions, Vocals). Again the sound of the album differs from the first two, the tracks are different from one to another by genre, some more Blues, others more Rock, passing through Boogie moments or more Melodics, always maintaining an high-level technique in the performance. The latest album released by Wild Turkey is the ""Live at Wellington 1973"" also on [l=Audio Archives].

The foundation of their sound lied within the Bass work of Gary Wallis who spend many hours working on the band's equipment and developing new sound techniques to enhance the band's overall presentation.

Formed in 1970, Galt, Ontario Formed in 1970 from the remnants of the R & B cover band FJ And The Impressions which included bassist [a=Mike Gingrich] and organ player Ron Baumtrog. 
Amish started out playing cover versions of McKenna-Mendelson Mainline, The Modern Rock Quartet, The Doors and James Gang songs.
The band’s manager, Bill Gefross, brought them to the attention of US label Sussex Records where Motown producer Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore, both staff producers for Sussex, took the band into GM Studios in East Detroit to record. Guitarist Botts was a draft dodger from the Viet Nam War and couldn’t return to the United States to record so session guitarist Joe Gutz performed on the album instead.

Their self-titled debut was distributed through Buddah Records in 1972. The album contains a remake of Traffic’s “Dear Mr. Fantasy”. The original song “Down The Road” was intended as a 7″ release with the non-LP track “Upon My Leavin’”, but the label never issued it.

After the album;s release, and a possible US tour, Amish merged with another Preston-Galt area band called Oasis and guitarist Bob Norris replaced Botts while drummer Kim Neil replaced Byrne.

Following the recording of a second album, but not released, Baumtrog left and Gery Mertz was brought in on keyboards. The band carried on for a couple of years, even as a 4-piece after the departure of Mertz.

Baumtrog is the Health & Safety Co-ordinator for Metokote Canada in Cambridge, Ontario; Mike Gingrich would play with Nightwinds in the late 1970s, Klaatu’s touring bassist from November 1981 until August 1982, The Headpins in 1983 and Holly Woods And Toronto in 1984; Doug Stagg passed away in 1999.

In 1971 they got a deal from Reprise Records to make their debut album, which was entitled “Kindred” and was produced by Chuck Negron, one of the three lead vocalists of Three Dog Night. 
Fronted by two lead singers, Marty Rodgers and Gloria Giano, KINDRED performed colorful, soulful, male-female polyvoiced, and energetic Rock music, combining the influences from classic Soul, Funk, R’n’B, Blues, Hard-Rock, and Psychedelic Rock. They had a strong focus on melody and arrangement with vast feature of electric keyboards, guitars, and variety of percussion instruments. 
In 1972, KINDRED released their second LP “Next of Kin” and disbanded. Bobby Cochran joined John Kay's STEPPENWOLF and recorded three albums with that band. In the 80’s, he formed an all-star group BOBBY AND THE MIDNITES (with Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Alphonso Johnson, and others)."

McLuhan was a concept and a mixed-media group where no particular musical venue or style would necessarily prevail. The creator of the idea was David Wright who composed most of the music and wrote the lyrics on their only album, Anomaly.

Paul Cohn was a friend and fellow-student of David Wright at UICC (University of Illinois Chicago). He was also a sax, flute and clarinetist in a week-end prom group called the Seven Seas. When the band lost their trumpeter he asked his friend who he knew could play, to fill in. Soon after the group had a falling apart thing with the singer and guitar player who had big plans and wanted to be stars etc...

So after the two stars had walked-out, David introduced the remains of the group to the McLuhan concept. The idea was to try different things in performances including special sound effects such as baby's crying, various weird instruments, background sounds, playing old movies during their performance (""Monster Bride"" was actually Bride of Frankenstein and in live performance they would turn on the movie at the point where the 20th Century Fox theme is played). The medium was the message"", not the content. Labels didn't matter

""The Wise-Fools Pub"" on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago hired McLuhan to perform every Monday night and they developed a small local following. Their performance got really thight at Wise Fools, and eventually it led to a Brunswick Record contract.

McLuhan only was together for about 1 to 1 ½ years. And they never had a live performance promoting their album, because the very last thing they did was producing Anomaly. It got some obscure radio play but it was ""dead"" as far as the band knew.

Anomaly's concept and ideas now sounds advanced for its time of release (1970). Uniquely american artrock in a brassy and groovy kind of way. Over the years its become cult album, but its never been re-released.

Believe it or not, but the band is still around (2024). Two founding members (NEAL ROSNER - bass, vocals and PAUL COHN - woodwinds) collected a few talented musicians from their home area to regularly play the  ANOMALY-album in its entirety plus a few classic 70s rock songs in saturday matinee shows @MONTROSE SALOON in CHICAGO/ILLINOIS.   https://www.facebook.com/paul.cohn.7/videos/3417486725182877"

Alexis Korner was a British blues musician and radio broadcaster. He had travelled with his parents through Switzerland and North Africa before settling in London as a 12 year-old. He grew up listening to the early blues pioneers and his music career as a guitarist and singer really began with engagements in [a1421932] and [a=Chris Barber] bands.

In 1956, Korner met [a1053895] with whom he founded the famed blues club in Ealing and the band [a=Blues Incorporated]. Their aim was to play 'real' and uncompromising blues (probably the first 'electric British blues' bands) becoming a platform for the careers of [a=Mick Jagger], [a409290], [a=Jack Bruce], [a=Charlie Watts], and many others.

Davis left in 1963 and Blues Incorporated disbanded in 1967. The following years saw Korner in many bands, most of them short-lived: [a3134722], [a=New Church] and [a=Snape]. From the late 1960s Korner toured, often as [a1251059] - for instance with [a=Peter Thorup], but mostly with bassist [a=Colin Hodgkinson]. By the late 1970s, Korner gained recognition as a radio DJ and broadcaster, continuing to record sporadically with bands such as [a325864] and Snape. His 50th birthday all-star concert was released as [m=477316]. In 1981, he joined the ""supergroup"" [a1227376], led by [a255182] and based on boogie-woogie keyboard players, which featured a rhythm section comprising Jack Bruce and Charlie Watts, among others, as well as a horn section. Korner died from lung cancer in 1984.

They played covers of well known songs. In 1965 the name was changed to Incrowd. In 1967 the name had already changed to Ekseption because there was another Dutch band with the name Incrowd.

The band was also joined by Rob Kruisman, who became the new bandleader. Later that year also [a=Rick van der Linden] (keyboards) joined the group. He was a classically trained musician who finished Conservatory and had played with several jazz- and popgroups, one of them was the Occasional Swing Combo. They met each other, because both bands played at the same gig. Van den Broek was impressed by the playing of Van der Linden and asked him to join Ekseption. In 1968 the band entered the Loosdrechtse Jazz Concours and won the first prize, a record deal with Phonogram.

At the end of the year the band was about to record their debut album with producer Tony Vos. By this time Alta and Griek were replaced by bass guitarist Cor Dekker (he died in 2005) and drummer Peter de Leeuwe. As the first single ""Beethoven's The Fifth"" was chosen and it became an instant hit for the band. The follow up singles ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and ""Air"" became big hits as well. Because of this chart success Van der Linden became the new bandleader. In 1969 Kruisman left the band because he was not happy with the new musical approach. Shortly after that also co-founder Van Kampen left the band (he dies in 2003). He left the music business, and became a music teacher."

The same year, the band cut their self-titled debut album, which was produced by [a=Ian Paice] and [a=Roger Glover] and saw Dio credited under his real name, Ronald Padavona.

Orange Wedge was established around 1968 in Baltimore, Maryland. The group evolved from Greg & The Originals. Members were Greg Coulson (lead vocals), Fred Zang (rhythm guitar, vocals), and Don Cowger (bass). In 1968 they added Craig Krixer (lead guitar), Dave Burgess (keyboards) and Tom Rizzo (drums). Krixer came up with the name Orange Wedge. The rock band began playing many teen centers, and school dances. After a brief illness and hospital stay in early 1969 Coulson rejoined the band. They began playing on regular basis quickly becoming one of the top hard rock bands in Baltimore. Orange Wedge could be seen at all the local clubs in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia. Zang and Krixer left the group in 1969 and joined Black Foot Smoke. Zang played guitar and/or bass for a lot of other groups.
He is still active in the music business. The group that created the records existed between 1971 and 1975.

When the group decided to do there own music, guitarist Joe Farace (ex-Fabulous Monarchs, Cabbage) brought his basic ideas to the group. Coulson was responsible for the lyrics. The entire band created the arrangements. The first record entitled ""Wedge"" was recorded and mixed in Baltimore at Flite Three Studios in 1972. Five hundred copies were made which were distributed a few local stores, and several labels for a possible deal. The remaining records were sold out at shows when the group performed.

In 1973 Burgess left the band becoming a member of Patch. Their second album was released in 1974 titled ""No one left but me"" and was recorded at Sheffield Studios with special guests Mark O'Connor, and Jay Graboski of Oho. This time a thousand copies were pressed and distributed in the same way. The group performed the songs live at their shows. They were also heard on the local rock radio station. The group was never offered a contract for either release.

In 1975 Joe Farace left the band. Coulson and Rizzo continued the group which finally called it a day in late 1978. Both Orange Wedge LPs have been reissued in the 00's in the States and also have been reissued as a 2 LP German import on Little Wing.

Joe Farace is still performing in Baltimore with his group Bottle of Blues."

The band started with Tim Roller (guitar), Mark Roller (bass), Paul Cassidy (drums), with Randy Byron, formerly of the Comin' Generation, on guitar. Byron was not in the band for long. During the recording sessions Cassidy was not able to perform so Bob LaNave was brought in on drums. So each side of the LP was recorded at different studios with a different drummer. There are at least three unreleased songs from the LP sessions. ""The Only Truth"" was released in 1972. Some discographies and music catalogs continue to list the album’s release date as 1969. The confusion over the release date may come from the album’s serial number of 69000 (on the Starshine label). Prior to the LP, they self-released a very rare 45 called ""Sleepy Softness"" which is much lighter in style (the flip side is the same song played backwards). The first single from the album was ""Who Can I Say You Are"". Most pressings of this single incorrectly list the album's original title as 'The First Supper'. The original vinyl LP pressing of the album has become a collector’s item due to its rarity, and the fact that it's strong all the way through. It also came with a full-size color poster. * * Beware collectors, as the LP has been counterfeited. In the 80's Starshine label owner Floyd Philips released a 45 of 2 old outtakes that came in a picture sleeve.

After being together for eight months, the band recorded our first, and only, album ""Keep On truckin'"" in one of Philadelphia’s finest recording studios.

Upon release the band started to get TV and radio airplay as well as being booked for larger concerts. The band were  a great success and growing more and more popular every day.

A few years later Surprize were approached by a larger and more well-known recording company. They wanted to promote and produce the second album and give it a release on their own label which meant the chance of
national distribution. 

Shortly after this approach whilst performing out of town, band leader Peter Accardi had a supernatural occurence, which would change the bands. 

In Peter's own words 
[i]"" After the show I had a party at my motel room. There I met a man who possessed satanic, psychic powers so strong that he controlled the minds of my friends and acquaintances to a degree that you would have to see for yourself to believe. Everyone there seemed to be able to read each others’ thoughts and led me to believe that every NORMAL human being could do this. They claimed to know ALL about ALL."" 

""Many of my friends actually read my thoughts and told me exactly what I was thinking. They told me that all I had to do to be like EVERYONE else was to relax, and let my mind wander into their level. Then according to their counsel, I would fully understand ALL things: eternity, infinity, where I came from and where I was going.""

I could actually feel an unbelievably strong pull on my mind and thoughts. I remember thinking that maybe this strange man was some sort of god, yet as I looked around the room, I saw only wrong and evil. At this I decided that he must be the anti-Christ, or even Satan himself. I had little knowledge of the Bible, but I had walked the aisle in a fundamental, Bible-teaching church to” receive Christ” at about age twelve.""[/i]

The next morning Peter Accardi, called for a special meeting. At this meeting Peter shared how something supernatural had happened to him, and how he knew he was going to heaven. His life was changed and he tried to share how we all needed the same thing in our lives. Much to everyone's shock, Peter walked away from his career as the lead singer of the band and decided to go to Bible College in order to become a Preacher.

A few weeks later keyboard player joined Accardi in his new calling and followed him on his journey to become a Preacher. Not long after the band decided to call it a day.

As for Accardi and Bissel both now serve the Lord at the Elkdale Baptist Church, West Clifford, Pennsylvania. Peter Accardi is the church Evangelist and Frank Bissel serves as the Pastor of the church."

A professional at twenty, he played with Charlie Musselwhite, Canned Heat, The Rolling Stones, and John Mayall before starting a solo career.

Mandel was one of a group of prominent 1960s midwestern Jewish bluesmen, including Michael Bloomfield, Corky Siegel, Barry Goldberg, and Bob Margolin, along with New York City-bred Al Kooper (born Alan Peter Kuperschmidt) and Philadelphia’s David Bromberg. A number of these musicians wound up crossing musical paths at some point with fellow Jewish-American midwesterner Bob Dylan.

Mandel was valued so highly by his peers for his innovative guitar work that he came within inches of joining the Rolling Stones as a replacement guitarist after Mick Taylor quit in 1974. He auditioned for the band, and his guitar work can be heard on two songs from the Stones’s 1976 album “Black and Blue”: “Hot Stuff” and “Memory Motel.” (Some English guy named Ronnie Wood, formerly of Rod Stewart’s band, got the full-time gig.) Mandel also played with bluesman Charlie Musselwhite and for English guitarist John Mayall’s legendary band, the Bluesbreakers.

Mandel, who was born in 1945, still performs and records.

Featuring guitarists Anthony and Charles Hawkins, bassist VC Veasey (aka Veesee L. Veasey), and drummer Tyrone Hite, the group got its start in the late '60s after Veasey, Hite, and Anthony Hawkins had spent time in a band called the Soul Agents, backing Edwin Starr and Gene Chandler. Inspired by Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?, they added Anthony's younger brother Charles on second guitar and christened themselves Black Merda. 

Despite some interest around their Detroit base -- including Norman Whitfield and Eddie Kendricks -- Black Merda signed to Chess, thanks in part to the psychedelic soul eccentric Fugi (aka Ellington Jordan), who they also backed on his Mary, Don't Take Me on No Bad Trip LP for Chess.

Black Merda's self-titled album sounded revolutionary enough, although the bandmembers were disappointed that it didn't reflect their heavy live shows. They then moved to the West Coast to continue playing with Fugi, but returned to Chicago to record a second album. Shortening their name to Mer-Da, the group returned in 1971 with Long Burn the Fire, a funkier outing that bore a likeness to early Funkadelic. 

The band quickly fizzled out, but over the next three decades, continued record-collector interest in the group eventually resulted in a reunion with Veasey, both Hawkins brothers, and Fugi, although Hite had died in 2004.

American composer, arranger and music leader at Manhattan Baptist Church in New York, New York and for a number of Christian releases on [l106394] and [l159646]. He was the founding musical director and conductor for [a3675827]. His production company is [l=BR Productions].

A resident of New York City, Buryl Red was born in Little Rock, Arkansas where he took up piano at the age of three, later playing in his parents’ church. Heavily influenced by the Black Gospel music he was exposed to in his hometown, he began improvising on the hymns he played in church. 

A graduate of Baylor University and Yale Graduate Music School, in the early 1960’s he served as the music minister of Manhattan Baptist Church--the first Southern Baptist church in New York City.

A composer, arranger, and hymn writer, Red was the founding musical director and conductor of “The CenturyMen,” a choir composed of Baptist church music directors from around the world. Founded in 1969, the group performed internationally. They were nominated for a Grammy in 2000 for their recording “Beautiful Star—A Celebration of Christmas.”

Red was also the composer of the landmark choral work “Celebrate Life!” which he created with Ragan Courtney and released in 1972. One of the songs from that work, “In Remembrance,” became a standard and was included in the African-American Heritage Hymnal in 2001 and in the Baptist Hymnal in 2008.

In 1974  he released his classic recording and accompanying hymn booklet “The Old Songs,” which brought modern, rhythmic arrangements to 33 favorite church hymns, introducing Baptists and other denominations to the idea of modern worship music which had begun with the Jesus Movement of the 1960’s and ‘70’s. 

Equally confident whether on stage at Carnegie Hall or the set of Saturday Night Live, during his career Red produced over 2,500 published compositions and arrangements and more than 4,000 recordings; provided musical supervision, composition and arrangement for several hundred shows, documentaries and musical specials for network and cable T.V., and wrote and edited over 50 musical textbooks. He was also a member of the Church Music Publishers Association.

In 1969, Frank Zappa heard The Persuasions singing live over the phone in a New Jersey record shop, picked his jaw up off the ground and promptly flew the group to Los Angeles to record their first album “A Cappella”. Thus began a 25-album recording career that focused on R&B, Soul, Pop, Rock ‘n’ Roll, but eventually included full album tributes to Frank Zappa, The Grateful Dead and The Beatles. The group even recorded a children’s album, “On The Good Ship Lollipop,” winner of many parents’ group awards. Through it all, The Persuasions’ sound was crowned by Jerry Lawson’s sweet and smoky lead baritone, (which began as a tenor), his effortlessly organic vocal arrangements, and his electrifying stage charisma. Critics often place Lawson’s inspired phrasing in a context with Sam Cooke, Brook Benton, and Otis Redding.

Modern vocal groups such as Take 6, Rockapella, The Nylons and Boys II Men all cited “The Kings of A Cappella” as a primary influence. The L.A. Weekly once wrote, “The Persuasions are to singing what Muhammad Ali was to boxing—invincible, innovative, original, beautiful.”

The five Persuasions—Jerry Lawson, Jimmy Hayes, Joe Russell, Jayotis Washington, and Herbert “Toubo” Rhoad—fell together by chance in 1962, harmonizing on outdoor basketball courts in Brooklyn after pick-up games. They went on to release 25 albums and to perform or record with artists including Liza Minnelli, Bette Midler, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Van Morrison, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle, Little Richard, Nancy Wilson, The Neville Brothers, Country Joe McDonald, B.B. King, John Hiatt, Leon Redbone. Their music has turned up in films from “Joe and the Volcano” to “The Heartbreak Kid,” “Streets of Gold,” and “E.T.”

The Persuasions’ first record deal was with Frank Zappa in 1968. He “discovered” them over the phone when their friend (and eventual producer) David Dashev, phoned Zappa from a New York studio, declaring, “you’ve got to hear this.” They debuted to the world with the LP, A Cappella on Zappa’s Straight label. Said Zappa many years later ” I could tell, even over the phone, that these guys were something special. Rock critic and author Greil Marcus once called The Persuasions’ style a “perfect marriage of passion and intelligence,” and Rolling Stone rated their 1977 album, Chirpin’, as one of the hundred best works of the 1970s. Mix Magazine proclaimed “The Persuasions are four parts of one voice, one spirit.” Cash Box correctly noted, in 1996, “These all-vocal, instrument-free heroes paved the way for today’s platinum A Cappella acts, Take 6, and Bobby McFerrin, as well as the retro-hip-hop styles of Boyz II Men, and Pentatonix.”

Following their Straight album, The Persuasions signed with Capitol and recorded three of the most arresting vocal albums ever made: We Came to Play, Spread the Word, and Street Corner Symphony. They covered tunes by Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Kurt Weill, Curtis Mayfield, The Temptations, Joe South, Rogers and Hammerstein, Lennon and McCartney. This eclectic mix of material and genre was a direct reflection of Lawson’s taste in music, and became a template for the many Persuasions albums that were to follow, culminating in the 1990’s with a gospel album, a children’s album, and acclaimed tribute albums to Frank Zappa, The Beatles, and The Grateful Dead.

These were singers in the tradition of great gospel A Cappella groups such as The Golden Gate Quartet and The Fairfield Four, but the Persuasions advanced the art form into a percolating, pulsing, street-edged meld of rock ‘n’ roll, soul, country, blues. . .In short, they “Persuasionized” any songs that suited them, and made them their own—from “Papa Oom Mow Mow” (heard in “E.T.”) to “Curtis Mayfield’s “Man Oh Man” to Kurt Weill’s “Oh Heavenly Salvation.” Lawson adapted a huge range of popular music to A Cappella style, with his own original arrangements, and co-produced Persuasions and recordings. He was an electrifying front man who also had the gift of gab. Some of his between-song patter was simply great stand-up comedy. The other members of the group all made vital contributions to the unique Persuasions sound. Jimmy Hayes’ silky bass-singing was and is without peer in all Contemporary A Cappella history—perhaps all A Cappella history. “Sweet Joe” Russell’s mighty harmonies and occasional leads were essential to the overall Persuasions sound. Jayotis Washington’s elastic tenor provided contrast on occasional novelty tunes, and Toubo Rhoad’s “invisible” baritone sort of held the proceedings together.

Though discovered by college radio in the early ’70s, championed by Barry “Dr. Demento” Hansen (who had them record his theme song), they got little more than token FM airplay on the west coast in the ’70’s, while in New York they were being played constantly by Frankie Crocker on WBLS. Their albums were often wrongly relegated to “Doo Wop” and “oldies” bins in record stores. Still, they carried on, building a deeply devoted audience and touring the world. Their live performances remain the stuff of legend (thankfully borne out by various audience recordings and Wolfgang’s Vault shows.) Incredibly, Bruce Springsteen opened for The Persuasions on more than one occasion. In 1979 The Persuasions became an integral part of Joni Mitchell’s legendary “Shadows and Light” tour.

Throughout the 60s, 70s, and most of the 80s, The Persuasions preached the A Cappella gospel almost entirely alone—certainly the secular, eclectic A Cappella gospel. Although they didn’t know it, they had created the genre that is today known as Contemporary A Cappella.

Perhaps, to really understand the impact of this American musical institution, it is best to quote Tom Waits, who famously remarked: “These guys are deep sea divers. I’m just a fisherman in a boat.”

Footnote:
There is a group calling itself “The Persuasions,” trading on well-known Persuasions repertory and arrangements today. They are effectively a tribute group that includes one member of the original five, Jayotis Washington. The leader of this group was never authorized by all original group members to use the name, “Persuasions.” Having one original member, and still claiming the original name seems unfair to audiences who will not know the difference between the authentic Persuasions and this group. Recordings and live performances after 2003 are not the work of the original, renowned A Cappella group, The Persuasions.*

Featuring guitarists Anthony and Charles Hawkins, bassist VC Veasey (aka Veesee L. Veasey), and drummer Tyrone Hite, the group got its start in the late '60s after Veasey, Hite, and Anthony Hawkins had spent time in a band called the Soul Agents, backing Edwin Starr and Gene Chandler. Inspired by Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?, they added Anthony's younger brother Charles on second guitar and christened themselves Black Merda. 

Despite some interest around their Detroit base -- including Norman Whitfield and Eddie Kendricks -- Black Merda signed to Chess, thanks in part to the psychedelic soul eccentric Fugi (aka Ellington Jordan), who they also backed on his Mary, Don't Take Me on No Bad Trip LP for Chess.

Black Merda's self-titled album sounded revolutionary enough, although the bandmembers were disappointed that it didn't reflect their heavy live shows. They then moved to the West Coast to continue playing with Fugi, but returned to Chicago to record a second album. Shortening their name to Mer-Da, the group returned in 1971 with Long Burn the Fire, a funkier outing that bore a likeness to early Funkadelic. 

The band quickly fizzled out, but over the next three decades, continued record-collector interest in the group eventually resulted in a reunion with Veasey, both Hawkins brothers, and Fugi, although Hite had died in 2004.

A native of Miami, Oklahoma, Jim Dawson grew up in Littleton, Colorado. A self-taught pianist and guitarist, he performed with several high school bands before enlisting in the United States Naval Air Reserve in 1963. By the following year, he had become a maintenance controller, servicing a squadron of F-48s or Phantom jets aboard the USS Independence in the South China Sea. Securing an honorable discharge in 1966, he settled in New York, where he began to hone his skills in folk music venues and coffeehouses. He briefly performed with a band, the Good Earth, featuring Bill Swofford; the latter went on to international fame as Oliver and scored a major hit with the pop tune, ""Good Morning Starshine."" Returning to solo performing in 1968, he waited for three years before securing a recording contract.

Dawson was considered one of the most promising contemporary folk artists of the early '70s. Signed by the Kama Sutra label in 1972, he was touted as the ""next Dylan"". His first two albums for the label, Songman and You'll Never Be Lonely with Me, however, failed to chart and included no hits. Signing with RCA in 1974, he recorded a self-titled third album with the production help of Jim Croce's producers, Terry Cashman and Tommy West. Failing to achieve his hoped-for breakthrough, he moved to Jamaica, where he spent several months doing drugs and drinking. Returning to New York in 1978, he resigned himself to cleaning apartments and driving a cab. Persuaded by friends, Dawson began writing new songs in the mid-'80s and performing in small clubs and coffeehouses in New York's Westchester County and Long Island. His first break came when he was hired to write and record the opening theme song for a popular German television soap opera. With the money he received, Dawson set up a home studio in his New York apartment. Since 1985, Dawson has collaborated with guitarist/vocalist Warren Nichols. The duo has worked together on two albums, Songman Recorded Winter 2000, released in May 2001, and Therapy in Session, released in 2002."

Bio by Rich Tupica, Lansing City Pulse
The rival to the Plagues was another local band of teens, the Ones. After founding members/brothers Kevin Nicholoff (bass) and Kerry Nicholoff (organ) recruited the dynamic lead vocalist and guitarist Danny Hernandez (who passed away in 2000 at age 53), the Ones quickly became Lansing’s biggest sensation.

The Ones, which also included drummer Mark Boomershine, toured the circuit, packing in huge crowds at each stop. The band primarily played covers of soul hits — and Hernandez had the perfect voice, guitar skills and stage presence for the job.

“We were doing James Brown stuff because Danny could do it,” Kerry Nicholoff said. “He was a great showman and guitar player. He’d drop down to his knees and all that. That’s what he did. His whole family were great musicians.”

Loren Molinare of the classic Lansing rock 'n' roll band the Dogs, which formed in 1969, recalled growing up in the Lansing teen scene and witnessing the brilliance of Hernandez and the Ones at the Armory on Washington Avenue.

“Danny was kind of like the Hispanic James Brown with a guitar — he was quite the showman,” Molinare said. “People take that stuff for granted now. Back then, rock 'n' roll was still fresh and new. Bands actually made money back then. Live music was a big deal. There was no MTV or Internet, so when a band came to town it was a big deal. It was a different world.”

Dave Cripe, who played in the Back Alley, a 1960s Lansing band, recalled seeing Hernandez perform in a group prior to the Ones. “Danny was fantastic, just unbelievable. I saw him when he was in a band called Pepe & the Problems,” Cripe said. “My cousin, who was a little older than me, took me over to a dance that was in the Frandor parking lot. I thought he was fantastic then. But the Ones — they were like celebrities in Lansing. They still are to our class at Everett High School.”

Aside from clubs, dances and concerts, the Ones played a seven-night-a-week gig at the Metro Bowl in Lansing, which was then a hip bowling alley and night club. That gig is where the band honed its stage show and perfected what would later be its signature tune.

“You Haven’t Seen My Love” hit the charts in late 1967, and later took off across the region in early 1968. The song featured lyrics by Hernandez and was produced by “Boogie” Bob Baldori of the Woolies at Fenton Records. Kerry Nicholoff, who wrote the classic organ riff on the tune, recalled being surprised by the reaction to the epic love ballad.

“It went to No. 1 in Lansing,” Nicholoff said. “They were playing it on all the stations non-stop. We’d sit outside on a summer night, and it seemed like the record was on every half hour. Then it started playing in Grand Rapids and other cities in the area. Then we started getting calls from just about every record label.”

The song, originally released by local labels Spirit and Fenton, soon got picked up and distributed by Motown Records — a first for a non-Motown-produced act. The record deal led to additional Motown singles and a tour, which included one date opening for Smokey Robinson & the Miracles.

By 1969, the Nicholoff brothers left the band. Hernandez continued to perform as Danny Hernandez & the Ones with a rotating cast of members for a number of years. Later lineups included Hernandez’s nephew Ronnie Hernandez (of the New Paris Bakery), as well as local musicians Tom Taylor, Gary Pitchford, Gary Melvin and Brad Hersey. "

His father Lenny was a champion rudimental drummer who would later run Hart Music, selling drums and musical instruments in San Carlos, California (USA), until 1971. The reason Micky Hart was not a member of the Grateful Dead between 1971 and 1974 had to do with his father embezzling the band's money. In the Dead, Hart shared drumming duties with [a385240].

Ian and Sylvia, a well-known folk duo who rose to popularity in the early sixties, began making records in Nashville around 1968. They wanted their own country band that played in a progressive style. Great Speckled Bird was formed in 1968 and was one of the pioneering groups that created the ""Country Rock"" style of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The group recorded two LPs. The first, Great Speckled Bird, was issued by Ampex Records in 1969. Columbia released the second, You Were On My Mind, in 1972. Great Speckled Bird toured extensively playing across the United States and Canada. They appeared in Japan at Expo '70, on the Johnny Cash TV show, and on Ian's television series, The Ian Tyson Show, from 1970 through 1973.

Jim Colegrove, Jeff Gutcheon and N.D. Smart formed Hungry Chuck in 1971. It was their intention to form a band that played an eclectic style of music blended from root forms of American Music: rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll, folk, country and gospel. The LP, titled Hungry Chuck, was issued by Bearsville Records in 1972. The group recorded an as yet unissued LP for Bearsville that same year. After making those recordings the group went their separate ways.

In 1978, Jeff Gutcheon joined Jim Colegrove in Texas to record Panther City Blues. Then again in 1982 to record an LP with the Texas rockabilly legend, Sid King, in Dallas. Jim, Jeff and N.D remained in touch over the passing years. In 1994 they decided to begin working on new material for a record. Jim and Jeff broke ground on the project in March 1995 in Fort Worth. In June 1996, Jim and Jeff joined N.D. at his home in Georgetown, Ohio for a session. In January, 1997, Jeff, N.D. and Amos Garrett came to Fort Worth, Texas where they joined Jim to record new songs. Six sides were completed and mixed in February, 1999. By 2001 Jim and Jeff were together in another band called Lost Country®. That group began issuing records on the Cool GrooveTM label. "

In 1970 Yorkville Records was able to get Capitol Records to be the distributor for Ocean. Their debut single, “Put Your Hand In The Hand” went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #10 in Canada. The song had been recorded as a track by Anne Murray on one of her albums a few years prior. Ocean quickly went from playing gigs at high schools and night clubs in Toronto to doing concerts across North America and Europe, as well as starring on the A list of pop music TV shows.
Their debut album, Put Your Hand In The Hand, featured their next two singles, “Deep Enough For Me” (#54Can) and “We’ve Got A Dream"" (#47Can). Though their touring won them many rave reviews, their personal income was tarnished by discovery of missing funds and mismanagement by agents. In 1972 they released a second album, Give Tomorrow’s Children One More Chance. The title came from the second line from their second single from the album, “One More Chance"" (#12Can). The first single, ""Make The Sun Shine"" was #75, and their last ""I Have A Following"" was #83.

This gang had political motivation to uplift young Latino and Black men in the community.

The name Ghetto Brothers was chosen by Hui Cambrelen one of the original founders along with Ray delaVega and Benji Melendez. Benjamin Melendez, who left the organization in 1976, was also known as a guitarist. He led a band, also known as the Ghetto Brothers, which included his late brother Victor Melendez on bass.

Upon Bob and Geoff's graduation in 19 71, they were able to devote themselves to full-time writing, recording, and playing on the local and regional scene. Jasey was a college senior at that time, and married to Syd, whose picture appears on the LP jacket. This album was recorded in late 1971 and early 1972. As you will hear, the band members were heavily influenced by the big British Invasion bands as well as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and the Eagles. The Jammers' soaring harmonies and intricate lyrics were the result of these influences on the trio. As live performers, the Jammers were known for giving incandescent shows with a rough edge (think Stones and the Who) rather different from what is captured on their album. A play list of covers interspersed with their own very original music was often compiled in an idiosyncratic way in order to fit the perceived needs of the audience for whom they were performing. The Jammers' ability to ""read"" the audience and to play with passion insured that everyone present had a good time. One audience member was heard to say, ""When I feel down, I want to come hear you guys play because you are always so upbeat."" What more could a band want to hear? A second Kansas City Jammers LP was recorded during the summer of 1972, followed by the single 'Give Me That Rock and Roll' in 1973; the single made it to number twenty on WCOL radio's playlist. Today, the band members have moved on to new careers, but still write and perform with other musicians. Bob has been practicing medicine for thirty years, and has a son and a daughter. He has laid down his drumsticks in favor of the guitar, and plays with an ensemble. Jasey has taught high school English for thirty-five years, and is the father of one son and three daughters. He co-wrote a hit song that was made famous by Eddie Rabbit in the 1980's. He performs with his wife and other local musicians in Ohio. Geoff is now a professor of social work and the father of two daughters. He is still writing songs but not performing, and is also the author of numerous books"

Robert John is an American singer-songwriter

John – born Robert John Pedrick – had been recording since he was 12 years old, first charting in 1958 (as ‘Bobby Pedrick’), and then continuing to record through the 60s for a variety of labels.

He recorded ‘Raindrops, Love and Sunshine’ in 1970, featuring his powerful (nearly ear-shattering) falsetto, and an arrangement that owes a huge debt to the previous year’s mega-hit ‘More Today Than Yesterday’ by the Spiral Starecase.

John went on to have a number of hits in the 70s and 80s, including the aforementioned ‘Sad Eyes’ (#1 1979) and even and putting that falsetto to use again in 1983 with a remake of the Newbeats ‘Bread and Butter’ (#68 1983), which came out on Motown.

As a highly intelligent student, Cassotto dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970s he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it."

In the Evacuation of East Prussia in early 1945, in harsh winter conditions, his mother first had to flee with the baby boy from the advancing Soviet troops. In 1948, the two also fled from Arnstadt in the East German Soviet occupation zone to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song ""Renegade"" on the album Steppenwolf Seven). Located in the British occupation zone, teen aged Joachim, suffering from eyesight problems, listened to music broadcast by the British Forces Broadcasting Service before his family moved to Canada in 1958.

In 1965, he joined a blues rock and folk music group named The Sparrows (later known as [a407730]), which had moderate success in Canada before moving to California, augmenting its line-up and changing its name to Steppenwolf in 1967. With music that pioneered hard rock and heavy metal, Steppenwolf had international success with songs such as ""Born to Be Wild"", ""Magic Carpet Ride"", ""Monster"", ""The Pusher"", and ""Rock Me"". This was multiplied by the use of ""Born to Be Wild"" and ""The Pusher"" in the 1969 movie Easy Rider.

He recorded both as a solo artist and with Steppenwolf during the late 1970s. As of 2017, John Kay continues to perform with Steppenwolf."

Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"".

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.

Bio by Rich Tupica, Lansing City Pulse
Another hot act in the ‘60s Lansing scene was the Woolies. The band saw national success and worked with Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Stevie Wonder and Chuck Berry.

The Woolies, led by “Boogie” Bob Baldori, made a mark far beyond Michigan. Baldori moved from Dearborn to East Lansing in 1961 to attend Michigan State University. His early bands, Maury Dean & the Nightshift and the Mongers, would be a precursor to a life-long career in blues-inspired rock-nroll. Baldori also founded Spirit Records in the mid-1960s, a local label with a catalog of over 30 records.

While most local bands were digging the British Invasion, Baldori said the Woolies, which also included the younger Baldori brother, Jeff, were more influenced by the roots of American music. “We were locked into early blues,” Baldori said. “We did a lot of Robert Johnson and Chicago, urban rhythm and blues. Basic rock is what we called it.”

Upon arriving in East Lansing, Baldori became heavily involved with the then-lackluster East Lansing rock scene. He was even a part of a club called the Fat Black Pussycat, which was home to the local booming folk music circuit that booked big-name singers like Pete Seeger. But soon enough, the Woolies, and rock 'n' roll in general, would take up all his time.

Baldori, a lawyer who still lives in the Lansing area, recalls watching downtown East Lansing grow into a musical hot spot. “When I got here, East Lansing was dry,” he said. “The closest place to play was Coral Gables, so we’d play there all the time. But when bars opened in East Lansing it became a mecca for music in Michigan. We played all the bars there. There would be 10 bands working in two or three blocks of downtown. We’d play Lizard’s (now Rick’s American Cafe) every Thursday for a long time. Then we switched to Sunday nights.”

While his band played in the same area as the Ones and the Plagues, Baldori said his band was part of a different scene. “We were more plugged into the regional scene,” Baldori said. “We traveled a lot. We’d even played gigs in California. Then we hooked up with Chuck Berry in 1966 and played all over the country with him. We also recorded two albums with him. We are still great friends with him. I played with him at his 80th birthday a few years ago.”

The Woolies’ biggest hit was a cover of “Who Do You Love.” Originally released as a single in 1966, the song later found its way onto Rhino Records' ""Nuggets"" box set, an acclaimed collection of 1960s garage singles.

“It went to No. 1 in a few markets,” Baldori said. “It was a big deal. The reason it didn’t score nationally is because back then it took forever to spread across the country. It was a hit in Boston, Miami, Los Angeles — but not all at the same time. It was spread out between ‘66 and ‘67. I still go to cities and people remember it being a No. 1 hit. It was breaking in regional charts, but had it broke all at once, it could have been bigger.”"

Released three years after his post-Beau Brummels solo album ""Candlemaker"",  1973's ""Pan""  found Ron Elliott returning to the recording environment with the band Pan.  Showcasing the talents of  singer Keith Barbour, drummer Don Francisco, bassist Sherman Hayes, and lead guitarist Arthur Richards, the high powered line-up quickly scored a contract with Columbia Records.  With Elliott responsible for all of the material, musically the album was quite diverse.  Tracks such as 'Long Way Home', 'Garbage Man', and 'More Than My Guitar' made it  clear Elliott had been listening to more than his share of early-'70s country-rock bands - echoes of The Flying Burrito Brothers, Michael Nesmith and Poco abounded throughout the collection.  That wasn't to say Elliott had totally lost his fascination with more commercial genres.  'Love Glow (Calamity Jane)' was near perfect top-40 pop, while 'Lady Honey' and 'Dancing To the Band' both included buoyant CS&Y styled harmonies.   Mind you, the album wasn't perfect.  'Delinga de Mattei' was a throwaway old timey ballad, while Barbour's performance on 'The Puppet' came precariously close to the MOR material that made him a mid-'60s solo star (thought there was no denying he had a killer voice).   Speaking of voices, as much as I enjoyed this al bum, to my ears one of the set's most interesting dynamics lay in how different Barbour and Elliott were.  Exemplified by tracks like ' Love Glow (Calamity Jane)', Elliott had a light, commercially-friendly voice.  In contrast, Barbour had a deep, gruff, soulful voice.   Hearing them sharing lead vocals on the same song ('Long Way Home'), was interesting, if somewhat jarring.  
Columbia doesn't seem to have done much to promote the LP.  No singles seem to have been released and you seldom run across a copy of the album.  Anyhow, anyone expecting to hear Beau Brummels-styled top-40 pop was probably going to be disappointed by the set, which would be unfortunate since the album was quite enjoyable."

A  self-taught guitarist, Hendrix began his musical career backing such R&B greats as Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and B.B. King. Brought to London from New York by former Animals bassist [a=Chas Chandler], Hendrix quickly established himself as the brightest new star on the burgeoning progressive rock scene of the early '60s. Along with bassist [a=Noel Redding] and drummer [a=Mitch Mitchell] he formed [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/255672-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-The]The Jimi Hendrix Experience[/url].

After a landmark appearance at the Monterey Pop festival, their debut album [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Are-You-Experienced/master/24497]Are You Experienced[/url] was released in September 1967. The album, and its 1968 successors - [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Axis-Bold-As-Love/master/24511]Axis: Bold As Love[/url] and the seminal blues-oriented developments of [url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Experience-Electric-Ladyland/master/24535]Electric Ladyland[/url] - earned Hendrix international acclaim as a premier rock instrumentalist and innovator of his generation. A 'greatest hits' collection, ""Smash Hits"" (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, ""Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey"" (1970), followed before his untimely death. A posthumous studio album, ""The Cry Of Love"", was released in January of 1971, followed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"" in June of 1973."

He is probably most famous as the leader of [a252521].

Doug Sahm excelled in a wide range of genres throughout his career and influenced both the Texas and national music scenes. Sahm was a musical prodigy who, at an early age, began playing with a local band. He was singing on the radio at the age of five and was so gifted that he could play the fiddle, steel guitar, and mandolin by the time he was eight years old. Around this age, he appeared on the Louisiana Hayride, and before he was a teenager, Little Doug Sahm, as he was known, had played onstage with such greats as Hank Thompson, Faron Young, and Hank Williams. When he was thirteen he was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, but had to decline so he would not miss school. 

Sahm's career spanned over four decades and encompassed a variety of musical styles, including German polkas, blues, rock, and Tejano. In the 1950s he attended Sam Houston High School, San Antonio, where he formed several bands, including the Dell-Kings, Pharaohs, and Markays. In 1964 he helped found the Sir Douglas Quintet under the direction of producer Huey P. Meaux. This outlandish group of Texans, which included Sahm's friend Augie Meyers, dressed up and pretended to be part of the so-called ""British Invasion"" of the mid-1960s. Sahm wrote the quintet's 1965 smash hit, ""She's About a Mover,"" which made the Top 20 chart. 

In the 1970s he moved to Austin and became a member of the ""Cosmic Cowboy"" scene, along with Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker. He released his solo debut as [a509253] when he was signed by Atlantic Records in 1973. With help from his friends Flaco Jiménez, Bob Dylan, and Dr. John, Sahm released the album [m152060], which included the song ""Is Anybody Going to San Antone?"" 

In 1989 Sahm teamed up with Freddie Fender, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados. The group produced a soulful mix of country music, blues, ballad singing, Texas rock-and-roll, and conjunto. They were signed by Reprise Records in 1990 and released their first album, Texas Tornados, later that year.

Sahm was named Rolling Stone's 'Chicano Of The Year' in 1971."

Died 6 July 2020 in Hermitage, Tennessee, of a stroke. 
Daniels, who wrote ""Carolina (I Love You)"" about his youth, was the son of a lumberjack and was raised with a love of bluegrass music. He borrowed a guitar when he was 15 years old and immediately learned to play basic tunes. He then acquired skills on mandolin and fiddle, but had to modify his playing when he lost the tip of his ring finger in an accident in 1955. He formed a bluegrass band, ''The Misty Mountain Boys'', but the group changed its name to ''The Jaguars'' following the single ''Jaguar'', which they recorded in 1959 (produced by [a=Bob Johnston]). Daniels said, ""for nine years we played every honky-tonk dive and low-life joint between Raleigh and Texas"". This enabled him to master a variety of musical styles, but his only national success came in 1964 when he wrote an [a=Elvis Presley] B-side ""It Hurts Me"", a tender ballad that remains one of his best compositions.

In 1967, Daniels followed Bob Johnston's suggestion to accept regular session work in Nashville. He played electric bass on [a=Bob Dylan]'s Nashville Skyline and later appeared on his albums Self Portrait and New Morning. He also worked with [a=Marty Robbins], [a=Hank Williams Jr.] (on Family Tradition) and [a=Ringo Starr] (on Beaucoups Of Blues), and took Lester Flatt his place alongside Earl Scruggs. He produced albums by [a=The Youngbloods] and by [a=Jerry Corbitt]. The latter, in turn, produced one by Daniels, both of which were released in the USA by [l=Capitol Records].

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

d. San Francisco, California, February 15, 1981, by drug overdose.
 Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, and was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".
Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud but clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his effect on the blues genre, on helping to influence the revived production of the guitar, and on many other guitarists.

Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1994 (Performer).

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

The Shadows primarily performed instrumentals, and was formed as a backing band for singer [a=Cliff Richard].

Marvin is famous for having a distinctive guitar sound and appearance, primarily using a clean sound with very high reverb and vibrato, which primarily gives a dreamy effect to the sound.

Prior to the album, Gentlehood recorded a handful of songs for the Zabad label in 1970.

A number of these musicians wound up crossing musical paths at some point with fellow Jewish-American midwesterner Bob Dylan.

Mandel was valued so highly by his peers for his innovative guitar work that he came within inches of joining the Rolling Stones as a replacement guitarist after Mick Taylor quit in 1974. He auditioned for the band, and his guitar work can be heard on two songs from the Stones’s 1976 album “Black and Blue”: “Hot Stuff” and “Memory Motel.” (Some English guy named Ronnie Wood, formerly of Rod Stewart’s band, got the full-time gig.) Mandel also played with bluesman Charlie Musselwhite and for English guitarist John Mayall’s legendary band, the Bluesbreakers.

The band formed in 1968.

Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

There has been a Deep Purple band in existence since the late 60s, apart from the eight years between 1976 when Mark IV split up and 1984 when Mark II reformed.

His father was a minister and Birdsong started singing in the Los Angeles Community Choir. After serving in Vietnam he played for American army personnel in clubs throughout Germany for a while. At the end of his service he was stationed in Baltimore where he played in the clubs around Pennsylvania Avenue. In the late 1960s he moved to New York City where he studied music and composition at the Manhattan School of Music and at the Juilliard School. Also in New York Birdsong met Wes Farrell who helped him get a contract with Polydor. By that thime he had already reconnected with LA high school friend Roy Ayers, who'd moved to New York too. Ayers got him session work with Herbie Mann, and Birdsong would join his band, appearing on the Ubiquity album and also working on later Ayers albums, as well on albums by RAMP and Eighties Ladies. Later on Birdsong would work with Marley Marl and  never achieved chart success with his solo work, but co-wrote Ayers' Running Away hit.

Hahn is known as one of jazz’s high-ranking guitarists. He became a key name in the 1960s for his input to the up-and-coming fusion movement, and has remained one of its dedicated promoters until today.
At the age of 7 he began playing the guitar and was playing professionally with the Bobby Wiley Rhythmaires at the age of 11. He joined the John Handy Quintet in 1964 and recorded two albums for Columbia Records with them.
His next stations were The Jerry Hahn Quintet (1967, one record for Arhoolie Records) and the Gary Burton Quartet with Roy Haynes and Steve Swallow (1968, three albums). Then the Jerry Hahn Brotherhood was initiated by him in 1970. This formation has been described as one of the “trailblazers of rock-jazz integration”. Later he joined the Bennie Wallace Quartet and he also performed, toured, and recorded with former Cream drummer Ginger Baker. Hahn has a Doctor of Music degree and has taught at several universities. He continues to perform, record, tour, and conduct guitar clinics. Hahn has also written columns for the Guitar Player magazine and a textbook for jazz guitar.

Born February 3, 1949 in Tallahassee, Florida and died October 24, 2010 in Tallahassee, Florida, USA at the age of 61.
One of the biggest country hit composers of the 1970s, she wrote or co-wrote for at least a dozen superstars. Among her most successful songs are “Tennessee Whiskey” (George Jones, 1983, David Allan Coe, 1981)), “Just Get Up and Close the Door” (Johnny Rodriguez, 1975), “Let It Shine” (Olivia Newton-John, 1976), “I’ve Never Loved Anyone More” (Lynn Anderson, 1975), “New York City Song” (Tanya Tucker, 1973, Jan Howard, 1973) and  “Half My Heart’s in Texas” (Ernest Tubb, 1978).
Others who recorded Hargrove tunes include Leon Russell, Michael Nesmith, Marty Robbins, Tracy Nelson, Eddy Arnold, Loretta Lynn, Al Green, Tammy Wynette, Sandy Posey, Jean Shepard, Anita Carter, Billie Jo Spears, B.J. Thomas, Dottie West, Jim Ed Brown, Moe Bandy, Tommy James, Merle Haggard, Asleep at the Wheel and Barbara Fairchild.
Linda Hargrove was also a recording artist, herself. Between 1974 and 1978, she released eight charting singles on Elektra, Capitol and RCA. Her biggest singing success was 1975’s “Love Was (Once Around the Dance Floor).”
Her five major-label country albums were Music Is Your Mistress (1973, Elektra), Blue Jean Country Queen (1974, Elektra), Love You’re the Teacher (Capitol, 1975), Just Like You (Capitol, 1976) and Impressions (Capitol, 1977).
At a time when female country performers were highly coiffed in glamorous evening gowns, Linda Hargrove defied convention by wearing her straight hair unstyled, not using makeup and dressing in denim. Hence her billing as “The Blue Jean Country Queen.”
Born in Florida in 1949, Linda Hargrove became intrigued by Music City after hearing Bob Dylan’s Nashville Skyline album of 1969. In 1970, producer and steel guitarist Pete Drake discovered Hargrove, signed her to a song-publishing contract and began using her as a guitarist on recording sessions by Waylon Jennings, Mac Davis and other stars.
Within a few years, Hargrove was producing sessions, herself. Among her productions were ad jingles for Plymouth, Frito-Lay, Golden Flake potato chips and Dodge trucks.
She married and underwent a religious conversion. As Linda Bartholomew, her married name, she recorded gospel albums in 1981 and 1989. She also left Nashville and returned to her native Florida.
Signed to a second song-publishing contract on Music Row in 1993, she returned to Music City to perform showcases in 1993, 1994 and 1996. She issued her final album, One Woman’s Life, in 2005.
Throughout those years, her health became precarious. She had been diagnosed with leukemia in 1986.

Born : November 22, 1941 //    Hollis, OK , United States

Born to William Nathan Stafford and Juanita J. Stafford in Hollis, Oklahoma, Terry Stafford grew up in Amarillo, Texas, and graduated from Amarillo's Palo Duro High School in 1960. After high school he moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a career in music.

His most famous song, ""Suspicion"", which was released on Crusader Records and which had previously been recorded by Elvis Presley, made it to #3 in the US and #31 in the UK singles charts. ""Suspicion,"" with a vocal by Stafford that reminded many listeners of Presley, had the unusual distinction of being at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 4, 1964, just below The Beatles when they made history by holding down the entire top five. The following week is when ""Suspicion"" topped out at #3, with The Beatles holding the other four spots of the top 5. Stafford's recording sold over one million copies. His follow-up, ""I'll Touch a Star"", made #25 in America. Both recordings were produced by Bob Summers (brother-in-law of Les Paul), who played all the instruments on the tracks as well as engineering and recording them. Bob released his own version in the 1970s as well as a remake with Ed Greenwald on vocals in 2008.

Born into a family of sharecroppers in Simonton, Texas, and greatly influenced by his Grandfather, a Baptist Minister, Dobie’s life revolved around family, the church and music. Moving from Texas to California in the early 60’s, Dobie met Sonny Bono, then A&R manager for Specialty Records. That encounter led to his first notable single, ""Look At Me."" (later recorded by The Righteous Brothers). Although ""Look At Me"" remained on the charts a healthy five weeks, Dobie’s real breakthrough came in 1965 with the release of ""The 'In' Crowd.""
In Hollywood he enrolled in acting classes, and appeared in Theatre-group Productions, including ""A Raisin In The Sun,"" ""The Amen Corner,"" ""Look Homeward Angel"" and ""Rhinoceros."" His dramatic gifts eventually landed him a role in the L.A. production of the Mega – Hit, Musical ""Hair,"" in which he remained for two and a half years.  ""Drift Away,"" (1973) still heralded as his signature tune, was written by Mentor Williams."

A professional at twenty, he played with Charlie Musselwhite, Canned Heat, The Rolling Stones, and John Mayall before starting a solo career.

Mandel was one of a group of prominent 1960s midwestern Jewish bluesmen, including Michael Bloomfield, Corky Siegel, Barry Goldberg, and Bob Margolin, along with New York City-bred Al Kooper (born Alan Peter Kuperschmidt) and Philadelphia’s David Bromberg. A number of these musicians wound up crossing musical paths at some point with fellow Jewish-American midwesterner Bob Dylan.

Mandel was valued so highly by his peers for his innovative guitar work that he came within inches of joining the Rolling Stones as a replacement guitarist after Mick Taylor quit in 1974. He auditioned for the band, and his guitar work can be heard on two songs from the Stones’s 1976 album “Black and Blue”: “Hot Stuff” and “Memory Motel.” (Some English guy named Ronnie Wood, formerly of Rod Stewart’s band, got the full-time gig.) Mandel also played with bluesman Charlie Musselwhite and for English guitarist John Mayall’s legendary band, the Bluesbreakers.

Mandel, who was born in 1945, still performs and records.

During their initial Folk / Bluegrass phase, the group released two singles; ""Gather Them Rosebuds"" and ""Dog Song"". Around this time, a newspaper from Alabama raved about the group being a rising talent. The group would continue performing live for a couple years, recording their first album ""Live"" somewhere around 1966 (although it was released a year or two later). In 1967, the group added guitarist Corky McCorkle, relegating Ron Stephenson to playing 12-String and Acoustic Guitar. David Boyce also joined on Guitar for a short period in 1967. Later that year, the group released their first full fledged Rock tracks, the single ""I Walk With The Sun / She Loves Me"". It was also released as ""I Think Of You And Cry / She Loves Me"". The single was distributed through three labels and charted locally. The band then recorded their first studio album ""Souvenir Album"" in 1969 and handed copies out at shows. It contained their latest singles along with originals by their producer (Hod David) and Musical Director / Producer (Skip Brooks). A switch of drummers then occurred in the same year, as Benny Joe Devine replaced Jim Moody. 


In 1970, The Town Criers recorded their sought after album ""Let's Do It!"", which was yet another live show. The album has been sampled several times and features the debut of the group's attempt at a Psychedelic sound. After this album's release, both McCorkle and Patterson left the group. Skip Brooks then joined as a full member, previously being the group's musical director and guest Keyboardist. He was also a songwriter and producer for the group. Ron Stephenson took over bass duties as Skip Brooks performed Rhythm Guitars in the studio. This lineup recorded the group's most advanced work ""4"". The album featured three original compositions from Skip Brooks and two King Crimson covers. The album was a departure from their previous work, containing more advanced instrumentals and complex songwriting. 

Details on the group after this point are murky. In 1972, the group released an album titled ""The Year Of The Toad"". It consisted of one side of Country Rock and another of Comedy and Poetry. This was most likely the band's last album as a foursome. The Town Criers bought and operated their own club / lounge, The Town Crier Play House sometime in the early 70's. It was there they recorded and distributed ""Town Criers In Concert"" in late 1972. At this point in their tenure, the only original members remaining were Ed Wing and Ron Stephenson. The group disbanded sometime later. It's possible more albums by this group exist and are undiscovered.

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

They're probably best known for two tracks ""Unchained Melody"" and ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' "". The latter being written and produced by legendary producer [a=Phil Spector] from 1964, which many critics deem to be the pinnacle of Spectors' producing career. In order for Lovin' Feelin's success, many believe it can be attributed to the fact the playing time was listed on the original promo's sent to radio stations as 3:05 --because Spector refused to shorten the track-- which was lower that it's actual playing time of nearer 4 minutes at 3:45. This is because at that time many stations would program shows to fit-in with ad-breaks so wouldn't play anything longer than around 3 minutes long. Also, British pop artist [a=Cilla Black] released a version in Christmas 1964, before the original version was released in the UK, which furthermore attracted media attention. All this happening despite the US being in the middle of Beatlemania and the British Invasion. 

In 1999, the performing-rights organization Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) announced that it was the most-played song of the 20th century. Additionally, the song was chosen as one of the Songs Of The Century by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In 1970, they engaged the Bolivian percussionist Thomas Goldschmitt (mainly hand percussion) and got a recording contract with BASF. Two additional members were added to their line-up: Ingo Bischof (keyboards) and Wolfgang Brock (drums). ""Karthago"" was recorded in October 1971 graced with excellent heavy guitar work and the funky, gutsy vocals of J. Albrecht, recalling the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the heavy progressive funk band Funkadelic.

More Santana-esque instrumental work was present on ""Second Step"", recorded in May 1973. W. Brock had left for The Rattles in February 1973 and was replaced by Norbert 'Panzer' Lehmann on this album. Then Lehmann departed to the heavy progressive band ""Epitaph"", and he was replaced by Konstantin Bommarius (ex-2066 & Then, Abacus). Hartwig also left in the Summer of 1974. His replacement was something of a sensation at the time - Glenn Cornick (ex-Jethro Tull). They signed with Bacillus label and relocated to Oxford, England, in November 1974, where they recorded ""Rock'n'Roll Testament"".It marked a change of style towards a smooth, well-produced rock with some minor symphonic touches.

In January 1976 they recorded the double album ""Live At The Roxy"". As Glenn Cornick had quit the group, Gerald Hartwig was now back again. Albrecht, Bischof and Goldschmitt were also helped by Reinhard Bopp (guitar, vocals, ex-Hardcake Special) and Ringo Funk (drums, ex-Atlantis, ex-Jeronimo). This record literally became the 'Karthago testament', as the group disbanded in the Spring of 1976. 

However, Albrecht later assembled Ringo Funk and Chico de los Reyes (piano, vocals) in the studio in the Summer of 1977 for the forgettable ""Love Is A Cake"" - a commercial disco, pop-rock disaster!

Frijid Pink was formed when members of the Detroit Vibrations Stevers and Harris were joined by guitarist Gary Ray Thompson, (who convinced Vibrations' manager Clyde Stevers (Richard's father) that he was a better candidate for a guitarist), and singer Tom Beaudry, who later took the stage name Kelly Green. They spent their first two years touring throughout the Southeast Michigan/Detroit area and eventually signed with Parrot Records. Their first two singles, ""Tell Me Why"" (#70 Canada) and ""Drivin' Blues"" (both released in 1969) failed to attract much attention, but their third 1969 effort, a distorted guitar-driven rendition of ""House of the Rising Sun,"" reached the Top Ten on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in winter 1970 and #3 in Canada. This disc sold over one million copies, thereby receiving a gold disc.

The band was so popular in their native Detroit area that a fledgling Led Zeppelin (who were just then getting started from the remnants of The Yardbirds) opened for them at Detroit's Grande Ballroom.

Joe DiFazio (keyboards, guitar, and vocals) who was the major driving force composing and writing lyrics. With an extensive background in classical music, his experience ranged from baroque, classical, romantic, and modern styles of music.
Royce Gibson (drums, percussion) who commanded a variety of instruments and added a unique facet that provided a symphonic dimension to the group's sound.
Roger Lewis (guitars), a former member of FREEPORT who joined the band in late 1974, following the production of the group's self-titled debut album. His guitar playing brought a new light on the group's original compositions.
During their short career ATLANTIS PHILHARMONIC performed with such acts as Styx, King Crimson, Glass Harp, Hello People, Wishbone Ash, Raspberries, Muddy Waters, and Tim Buckley. Their music has been called ""picturesque"" and has earned them the respect of an ever growing audience. The lush keyboard arrangements, intricate compositions, original mixture of styles, definite sound, and excellent vocal performance have placed this band among the best acts of the US Progressive Rock scene of the 70's."

LaBeef stood 6' 7"" (2.0 metres) tall and was given the nickname ""Sleepy"" from the appearance of his eyes. He was raised on a melon farm and moved to Houston when he was 18. There, he sang gospel music on local radio and put together a bar band to play venues as well as radio programs such as the Houston Jamboree and Louisiana Hayride.

In the 1950s, as the rockabilly component of rock-n-roll became evident, LaBeef began recording singles in the genre; his first, ""I'm Through"", was issued on Starday Records in 1957. In 1964, he moved to Nashville and moved to a more solidly country style, recording singles for Columbia Records. His first genuine hit was in 1968 with ""Every Day"", which peaked at #73 on the U.S. Billboard Country charts. After moving to Plantation Records in 1969, he scored a second hit in 1971 with ""Blackland Farmer"", which charted at #67. Around this time LaBeef also starred in the horror movie The Exotic Ones. LaBeef transferred to Sun Records in the 1970s and continued releasing albums and touring widely; his popularity flagged in America but rose in Europe. The 1980s saw him sign to Rounder Records, where he released albums into the 1990s.

The Brooklyn-born Sands' husky, soulful voice first attracted the attention of Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller's Blue Cat label in 1965, and upon signing with the company she entered the studio with the songwriting/production team of Chip Taylor and Al Gorgoni to record her debut single, ""Take Me for a Little While."" Prior to the record's release, a test pressing was smuggled to executives at Chess Records, where Chicago soul singer Jackie Ross immediately cut her own version of the song; just as Sands' rendition of ""Take Me for a Little While"" cracked the R&B charts, Chess' marketing muscle assured that Ross' cover began receiving the lion's share of radio airplay, leaving the original in the dust. (Ross, it should be noted, was initially unaware that the test pressing had been stolen and left Chess soon after.) The ensuing litigation severely hobbled Sands' fledgling career, and her follow-up, 1966's superb ""I Can't Let Go,"" was lost in the mire; a year later, the song became a major international hit for the Hollies. Moving to the Cameo label, in 1967 Sands resurfaced with the Taylor-penned ""Angel of the Morning""; despite heavy early airplay, within weeks of the single's release Cameo went bankrupt, allowing Merilee Rush's recording of the song to top the pop charts a few months later. In 1969 Sands finally notched a hit of her own with ""Any Way That You Want Me,"" also issuing an LP of the same name. She spent the majority of the following decade focusing primarily on songwriting, however, and after completing the 1979 RCA album Suspended Animation retired from performing altogether. In 1996, Sands joined Taylor onstage during a gig in Los Angeles, the impromptu reunion proving so successful that they agreed to re-ignite their collaboration; the album Women in Prison, distinguished by a far more rootsy feel than her blue-eyed soul near-hits of the 1960s, followed in 1999.

Formed in 1971 in Edwardsburg, Michigan. U.S.
Disbanded in 1975
Members were Paul Decker (Back Vocals, Keyboard, Percussions), Jimmy Robinson (Vocals), Bill Wallace (Guitar, Keyboards), Chuck Eagan (Guitar, Back Vocals), Tom Curtis (Drums), Keith Robinson (Back Vocals, Keyboards), Jerry Opdycke (Bass, Back Vocals)

Kopperfield emerged out of the ashes of a couple high school bands in Edwardsberg, MI. Keyboard player Keith Robinson and bassist Jerry Opdycke were in competing combos, but were also good friends who had frequently jammed and discussed the possibility of connecting in a band. The opportunity finally presented itself when their respective bands began to disintegrate in the fall of 1971. Opdycke soon put in a call to Robinson. Chuck Eagan and longtime friend Bill Wallace accompanied Opdycke into the group on guitars and Robinson brought in his little brother Jimmy as the lead vocalist. Tom Curtis, at the time playing bass in another band, joined on drums. The new collection of players jammed and gelled instantly and Kopperfield was formed. From the very beginning, they were writing a prodigious number of original songs. By 1972, they had worked up enough courage to journey to Chicago and record some of them, although they were still rough early efforts. By 1973, the material had improved so much that the band began work on its Tales Untold project in between extensive stretches on the road. Kopperfield also lost Wallace during this period and replaced him with another keyboard player and vocalist, Paul Decker. Tales Untold was finally finished and released in 1974 and Kopperfield immediately began work on its second LP, tentatively titled Back to Bitchin' (the album was never finished or released). They also signed with a booking agency out of Chicago, allowing them to open for groups and artists like Foghat, Country Joe McDonald, Kansas, the James Gang, and H.P. Lovecraft. By 1975, however, Kopperfield came to an end."

After releasing four unsuccessful singles on Fontana and EMI, Torpey was replaced by first [a2579185], and then Mick by Andrew David Scott (b. 30 June 1949, Wrexham, Wales) and the new line-up signed to RCA. The band were introduced to the writing partnership of Chinn and Chapman, who were to provide the band with a string of hit singles.However, the band were writing their own hard-rock numbers on the b-sides of these hits. The group's determinedly effete, glam-rock image was reinforced by a succession of Top 10 hits.

The Sweet in 1974 recorded the album Sweet Fanny Adams without the assistance of Chinn and Chapman. The album charted at number 27, but disappeared again after just two weeks. As The Sweet became more of an albums band, the hit singles began to dry up. Following a move to Polydor, they cut four albums with each release making less impact than its predecessor.

Mandel was valued so highly by his peers for his innovative guitar work that he came within inches of joining the Rolling Stones as a replacement guitarist after Mick Taylor quit in 1974. He auditioned for the band, and his guitar work can be heard on two songs from the Stones’s 1976 album “Black and Blue”: “Hot Stuff” and “Memory Motel.” (Some English guy named Ronnie Wood, formerly of Rod Stewart’s band, got the full-time gig.)

Until disbanding in 1975, Podipto was known as one of the brightest acts hailing from the Midwest, blending rock, blues and country into a unique sound that would never be forgotten by those who heard them or saw them perform. Throughout the early 1970s, Podipto toured the country, performing with acts such as Elton John, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, The Carpenters, Kenny Rogers, The Guess Who, Poco, John Sebastian and many others. 

The band's unique sound was created by the blend of three vocalists—two male and one female—who traded leads and joined in harmony. Podipto could shift from feel-good dreamy 70s folk to growling twin-guitar blues on a dime, refusing to let any one genre of the time define their sound. Most of the band's original songs were written by rhythm guitarist and vocalist John Collins, and bassist Jack Sundrud. Dan Lund played electric guitar with (then wife) Karen Lund on vocals and piano. John Calder was the band's initial drummer, but after being drafted into Vietnam, Steve Rundquist replaced him on drums. The band had a couple of lineup changes in 1973, when Steve and Jack left the band to pursue other projects. For a short time Ron Kelley provided on vocals and bass in 1973, until Wilson Roberts joined the band. Chester Ellingson took over drums in 1973. 

Podipto recorded two albums, the first in 1970 with GRT Records of Canada. Shortly after the album's release, the label faltered, leaving Podipto and its other bands with an uncertain future. Dubious of record companies, Podipto recorded its second album just as its title suggests: Homemade. The band broke up in 1975, to the dismay of many fans who embraced their sound and messages of peace and love, good times, political awareness and relentless groove.

Now, 40 years after their breakup, Podipto's music is being restored and issued for the first time on CD and digital download. In addition to their two albums, fans will hear studio demos of lost songs, and live recordings of the band that span all the years and all the members of the band. These recordings have been meticulously cleaned and readied for release after sitting for 40 years in various basements across the U.S. 

Podipto was Northern Minnesota's band that everyone loved, a band that made it big enough to get national attention and ride a wave of 1970s action and unrest, and a band that ended quietly, leaving an empty space that could never be filled and a sound that could never be replicated."

John and Jim knew at a very early age, music would be their calling. After studying music for twelve years it was time to take the show on the road. THE LINKS performed all across the country, and finally settled in Reno, Nevada.

Performing with John and Jim throughout the years were, Dick Cedarstrom, Stan Galli, Mark Ashworth, Steve Knight and Larry Ringstad. In 1985, while traveling through Omaha, John and Jim stopped in to Anthony's Steak House to see the Johnny Ray Gomez show. Performing with Johnny Ray was singer, bass player, Mary Howard.

Herbie began getting involved with the newly emerging disco scene when he covered LTG Exchange's ""Waterbed"". It's a very funky instrumental with a great bassline. From this album he also covered ""Hijack"" by Barrabas. This became popular in the early disco scene in the UK and was one of the very first 12"" promos ever pressed in Europe.

Another disco recording was his cover of Celi Bee's ""Superman"" theme which peaked at #26 on the US Billboard charts. For this album Herbie worked with New York disco producer Patrick Adams and together they wrote the jazz-funk classic ""Etagui"".

She came under fire in late 2023 for allegedly manufacturing this indigenous background and hiding her Massachusetts birth to white parents of Italian ancestry, according to a CBC documentary that found her original 1941 U.S. birth certificate. Sainte-Marie’s Order of Canada appointment was terminated by an ordinance signed by Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on January 3, 2025; no reason was given for the termination.

She came up in the Greenwich Village scene in New York in the 1960s and her music has generally been categorized as folk and traditional music (although she did record one mostly-country album in Nashville: ""I'm Gonna Be a Country Girl Again"".)

Rural was formed in the Winter of 1970 when Ames area musicians Ralph Stevens (drums) and Charlie Grau (guitar) came together with the idea of starting a new group. They quickly brought on board Doug Campbell (bass), Jay Saul (guitar) and Tom Till (keyboards & guitar). Rural’s lineup was now complete, and amazingly enough, would NOT change throughout the life of the band.

The band moved to a beautiful farm outside of Ames that they nicknamed the Depot, and it became home base of one of Iowa’s most successful bands of the 70’s.

Their early song list included: The Band, Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Dylan, and even a little Dave Dudley (“Six Days On The Road”). But things were about to change.
In the summer of 1971 they were asked to play Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, with the Ragin’ Cajun, Doug Kershaw. After working with Kershaw, Charlie Grau became inspired and took up fiddle playing. This added an entire new dimension for Rural as shown in their song list.

Their sound became a country rock sound, and their career in Iowa jumped up to all new levels.

Soon their popularity would grow and they were constantly on tour to such states as Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, and the Dakotas. Quickly, they would cover over a nine-state area. One of their favorite places to play at was our own Hollyhock Ballroom where they appeared four times in 1972 and 1973.

They had the chance to work with many national acts including Mason Proffit, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and even Sha-Na-Na.

With their territorial success, going into the studio and recording proved to be successful as well.

In 1973, they released their first 45 single, “Country Boy” backed by “In The Morning”. (Front Porch Records 837). This was followed by their second single release, “Ripe Tomato Blues/Clear Blue Western Sky”. (Mole Records MR #1)

In 1974, they offered up their only LP release, “One By One” (Mole Records MR #2), with all their records being good Midwest sellers."

Usually touring and sometimes recording as [a=Ronnie Hawkins] And [a=The Hawks (2)], Hawkins is legendary for his skill as a talent scout & mentor. His band had an ever-changing lineup with many members going on to successful careers elsewhere. Notable in his career was the December 1969 stay by [a=John Lennon] & [a=Yoko Ono] at his home in Mississauga, Ontario. Lennon signed his erotic ""Bag One"" lithographs during his stay there during the couple's campaign to promote world peace. His achievements include induction into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2002, in recognition of his lifetime contribution to music and his generous support of the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario and other charitable organizations. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2004, and in 2013, Hawkins was made an Honourary Officer of the Order of Canada. 

Hawkins has been mostly retired since his 80th birthday concert, dubbed ""The Last Hurrah"", at Toronto's [l=Massey Hall] in 2015, and sold Hawkstone in 2017.

For unknown reasons, the Hawkins songs ""Going to the River"" and ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman"" have been credited to Alice Cooper and released on various versions of the live album [m204910]"

In 1962, after a series of 32 burglaries that included groceries, hardware stores, schools and a church, seventeen year old Armand Schaubroeck was sentenced to three years in jail. He was charged with safecracking and thrown in the Elmira State Reformatory, a maximum security prison in New York. He would get out a year and a half later on parole but the impression would remain vivid in his mind. 

...Apparently his imprisonment acted as a catalyst to the birth of his very unique and somewhat deranged rock 'n roll persona- he named his band Armand Schaubroeck Steals and all his music seemed to be a cathartic exorcise to the obsessions that haunted him.

His sound borrowed elements from Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Kim Fowley, spiked with a provocative Andy Kaufman-esque weirdo sense of humour (the monogram of his name reads A.S.S.) and a distinctive fuck-you attitude that came mostly from the fact that he didn't need music to make a living. He and his brothers would found a musical store that is today one of the most successful in the business. 

Not only did he have relative monetary independence, he also had a whole place full of instruments for himself. He built a studio in the store's basement, created Mirror Records and recorded a handful of albums that were personal, obsessive, ironic and deliberately abusive to the public ears. He even wrote sneering remarks in the back of his record covers saying ""I doubt if you'll ever hear this record on the radio."

His stage name that he would be known by in the music world was “Little Enis”. The thing Little Enis was best known for was his left-handed upside down style of guitar playing. This was a style that was all his own. Instead of restringing the guitar which was normally made for right handed people, Little Enis played his guitar upside down. The way this was accomplished was by cording with his right hand over the top of the guitar neck and with his left hand he strummed up from the bottom instead of down in the fashion a guitar would normally be strummed or picked per say. His style of Guitar playing did not go unnoticed; the Grand Ole Opry even noticed his unique and distinctive guitar playing.
Little Enis’s band was called ""The Table Toppers"". They toured for a time with Jerry Lee Lewis as his opening act. Carlos is listed in the Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame. He was an Elvis impersonator performing shows that would literally tear the house down. Playboy Magazine published an eleven page story about Little Enis and his band. The article was titled ""The Greatest Left-Handed Upside Down Guitar Player"". He is also included in a book by Ed McClanahan titled ""Famous People I have Known"".
Glenn Carlos Toadvine was the son of William L and Dora Toadvine. He was born in Hogue Hollow, Boyle County, Kentucky on August 5th 1935, where he was raised with his two brothers. The three boys attended school in Parksville, Kentucky and played basketball as Parksville Wildcats. At the young age of forty Carlos died from a heart attack while visiting his sister in Pompano Beach, Florida on February 26, 1976. There were more than a thousand people that showed up for his memorial service.
His obituary was carried in many newspapers around the country, such as: the San Diego Union in San Diego, CA; Aberdeen Daily News in Aberdeen, SD; Plain Dealer in Cleveland, OH; Athens Sunday Messenger Athens, Ohio; Sheboygan Press Newspaper in Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Evening Independent Newspaper in Massillon, Ohio; Herald Times Reporter, Newspaper in Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Trenton Evening Times, NJ; Lock Haven Express Newspaper in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania; Santa Ana Register Newspaper Location: Santa Ana, California.

After being sent to the Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school at the age of nine, he spent much of the next two decades in correctional facilities, including three years at the Ohio Penitentiary. Coe said he received encouragement to begin writing songs from Screamin' Jay Hawkins, with whom he had spent time in prison.

After concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium while he performed on the street. He caught the attention of Shelby Singleton, owner of the independent record label Plantation Records and signed a contract with his label.Coe is a retired member of the Louisville, Kentucky, chapter of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club.

Coe's musical style derives from blues, rock, and country music traditions.His vocal style is described as a 'throaty baritone'. His lyrical content is often humorous or comedic, with William Ruhlmann describing him as a 'near-parody of a country singer'. Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Coe as ""a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest honky-tonk and hardest country of his era […] he may not be the most original outlaw, but there is none more outlaw than him"""

Bruce and Tim were drafted into the Army, and ended up at the same post in Ft. Mead, MD, playing gigs during nights and on weekends. They performed at an Armed Forces Music Festival, with headliner Roy Clark and master of ceremonies Ed Sullivan, before top brass and an audience of thousands. Back in KC during the 70’s, Bruce and Tim formed a band with bassist Bob Schad and drummer/multi-instrumentalist Mark Higbee (2008 KMHoF inductee with The Fabulous Four) that was very successful both locally, and for notable runs in Reno and Lake Tahoe, NV. A live album ,“Strawberry Pickins” resulted during the 70’s, as did a 1976 studio LP “Somebody Give Me A Smile”. Composed mostly of original songs by Bruce and Tim, the additional session players included Lynn Pillar (steel guitar) Eric Bikales (keyboards) Peter Jacobs (drums) and Allen Blasco (guitarist, multi- instrumentalist, producer) all of whom are KMHoF inductees. A 45 single, “Pleasure to Love” b/w “Foolsgold” was released in 1979. Bureman & O’Rourke’s latest production, the 2013 CD “Shoulder To Shoulder” features 100% original songs by the duo.

The trio moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1972, where they caught the attention of Willis Alan Ramsey, a Texas singer and songwriter. The group specialized in combining advanced three-part harmony singing in the manner of Crosby, Stills, and Nash with original songwriting influenced by traditional pop, western swing, and US roots music including country, New Orleans R&B, Cajun music, and soul. In 1974 the group released its first album, 'Blame It on the Bossa Nova', on it's own Lespedeza Record Company label.

Uncle Walt's Band broke up initially 1975. At this time, Hyatt and Hood joined the group [a4287912], an electric group that also combined popular singer-songwriter styles of the 1970s with harmony vocals and prominent country, soul, and R&B influences. 

In 1978, Uncle Walt's Band played a reunion gig in Austin, a city to which the members had relocated, and the success that performance initiated a reunion that lasted for several years and saw the recording of three additional albums. During this period, the group appeared on the nationally-televised concert series 'Austin City Limits'. From 1982 until 1993, Uncle Walt's Band reunited occasionally as the group's members pursued solo careers in Austin and Nashville. Hyatt's death during the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in Florida in 1996 precluded any further reunions.

Though Uncle Walt's Band's four independently released albums had limited distribution and sales during the group's lifetime, ongoing fan interest prompted reissues of their music on two Sugar Hill Records compilations in 1991, and on Omnivore Records' comprehensive reissue series from 2018-2021."

Two Paxton songs received a lot of attention: ""Jesus Is My Lawyer in Heaven"" and ""Jesus Keeps Takin' Me Higher and Higher."" These and the title song constitute the album's high-energy numbers. Another Paxton song, ""The Gadget Man,"" is noteworthy for its complex and original structure.

[l=A&M] signed him for some demos, at least one of which was released, but evidently that deal didn't last. He hung out with a few songwriters and attempted some collaborations, the one of note being with the post-[i][a252484][/i] and pre-[i][a457236][/i] [a=Tommy Talton]. They shopped a few songs and had songs cut, but nothing ever came of that.
Berry ran into a bunch of people in L.A. (Notably [a=George S.

Neither album went anywhere, though Berry's touch as songwriter led to the solo contract with [l=RCA].
This album, [r=1152228], received praise among critics but fell flat on its face commercially.

Breaking unknowns seemed a crap shoot in those days and, having worked with many of the promo and A&R people during those times, it was no wonder.
He did have his option for a second album picked up and test pressings exist. One made it into the hands of a critic for either Phonograph Record or BAM and he raved but, alas, the record was not released.
Berry formed another band with George S. Clinton that went by the name of [i][a1522333][/i]. The band released one eponymous album in 1976.

The Couriers was one of many names used by student outreach ministry teams at Central Bible Institute, (C.B.I.) in Springfield, Missouri for many years. Most of the teams were musical groups; duets, trios, quartets, ensembles, etc. Though the outreach group names were never officially owned by the school; now an accredited college, each year students would assume one of these established names which had previously gained a quality reputation by other alumni. Because of this practice each recycled group name took on new life each year. The same group personnel usually didn't last more than a semester or at longest a full school term. With a constant flow of senior graduations and freshmen enrollments each group would either be reorganized or revitalized annually.

""The Couriers"" originally formed in 1953, consisted of Dick Malone, lead; Roger Kling, baritone; Nick Schubert, pianist; Lem Boyles, tenor and Cliff King, bass. They were the most sought after bible school group during their year and a half tenure.

The group endured many personnel changes before turning full-time professional in 1958 and relocating to Pennsylvania. The group went though many changes during the next 22 years, including switching from a quartet to a trio, until Neil Enloe and Duane Nicholson decided to retire the group in 1980. In 1984, Duane and Neil decided to reorganize the group and the Couriers were reborn, with Neil's brother Phil rejoining the group.

His music combines blues, pop, jazz, boogie woogie and rock and roll.

Rebennack began playing the piano at the age of six and, as he grew up, he became strongly influenced by the style of [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1394017-Henry-Roeland-Byrd]Roy Byrd[/url] (aka Professor Longhair). He immersed himself in the music and voodoo cultures of New Orleans, where he became known as [a=Mac Rebennack], playing the organ in strip-clubs with 'make-up' bands in the French Quarter.

However, it was as a session guitarist with [a=John Vincent]'s Ace Records that gave him his first break, around 1957. He worked with the New Orleans R&B session crew at Crescent City's '[a=Cosimo V. Matassa]' studio and with an 'All For One' co-operative formed by [a=Harold Battiste]- cutting Storm Warning (Rex, 1957) and singles on Ace, Rex and AFO (an acronym of All For One) .

Rebennack then moved to California in 1962 with Battiste's crew, where they played on [a=Sam Cooke]'s final recording session. Rebennack subsequently undertook a lot of session work around LA (appearing briefly for a Freak Out! album session with [a=Frank Zappa]) and developed his Mardi Gras persona of Dr. John Creaux The Night Tripper with Battiste's help, assembling the Gris-Gris album whilst sessioning for [a=Sonny & Cher].

His drawled and ponderous style, tinged with a husky Southern Comfort delivery, caught the mood of the moment upon the album's release in 1968 giving him the commercial freedom to explore the many facets of the Louisiana blues and Memphis funk cultures in following releases. His recordings have been supported by such alumni as Clapton, Jagger, Allen Toussaint, The Meters, Jerry Wexler and Mike Bloomfield. He had a top-ten hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, and he appeared in the Martin Scorsese film The Last Waltz (1978).

Dr. John kept touring and releasing records. He unexpectedly passed away of a sudden, massive heart attack on June 6, 2019."

Became a citizen of Switzerland and relinquished American citizenship in 2013.

Turner began her successful career with hits like ""River Deep, Mountain High"" alongside husband [a=Ike Turner] in the 1960s, from whom she separated after years of abuse, as she reported in her autobiography ""I, Tina"".

In 2008, Turner came out of semi-retirement and embarked on her ""Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour"" - one of the largest ticket-sales tours of that year. 'Rolling Stone' magazine has hailed her as ""One of the greatest singers of all time"", reaching unprecedented heights in stadium-filling Rock."

The band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.

The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.

Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95. Over the course of his career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones (e.g. on Street Fighting Man), George Harrison (appearing on All Things Must Pass), Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell and Cass Elliot. One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

Kuchler (keys), Boyd Williamson (guitar), Gabriel Berrafato (bass), and Lynn ""Lance Chance"" Gnatzig (drums). Previously known as Birth, the band changed its name in April 1974 when Boyd replaced Bill Schmidt on guitar. Birth's roots were a band called Atlantic Ocean, which had formed around a group of musicians who were attending college at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse. They had played most as a 6 piece band, but had at one time, with horn players, as many as ten people onstage.

Yancy Derringer played a lot of originals at a lot of bars, festivals, and college campuses around the Midwest, and had a good fan base that had followed the previous bands. Dedicated to writing their own songs, they nonetheless also did unique covers of songs by Mott the Hoople, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and were also known for an impressive Led Zeppelin medley. Another highlight of their show was a nine-minute-long original, ""Weedburner,"" a slide guitar stoner's anthem that Boyd played on a Rickenbacker with a brilliant built-in light show. C.F. handled the lead vocals, Hammond organ, piano, and Minimoog, while Lance and Gabe showed themselves off as one of the tightest rhythm sections ever.

They released an album of originals in 1975 called ""Openers"", which generally received excellent reviews and is widely regarded as a collectible in Goldmine and Rockin' Records (it has been reissued on CD by Gear Fab Records in the US, and is being pressed as an LP in Italy on the Comet Gear Fab label) but underfunding and a underachieving manager helped undercut its momentum and ultimate success within a year of its release. This four piece band broke up in October 1976, and, after having ""real jobs"" for a few months, were itching to play again.

In the meantime, Bill Schmidt had put together an 8-track studio at his home in Monroe, where Yancy had started recording tracks for their second planned release, ""Good Time Strangers,"" which was never finished, due to the band breaking up. He introduced C.F., Boyd, and Gabe to singer and 12-string guitarist Gregg Huber from Oconomowoc. Bill kept time on drums and spun the reels. Gregg introduced some songs of his own, and also some that had been written by J.C. Hall, Jr., a singer/songwriter that he had worked with in a band they'd had in high school, known as Gordeoux-Huber-Hall.

This second version of Yancy Derringer was vastly different from the first, turning away from hard rock towards more melodic music, relying more on lush vocals and more complex chords than the more straightforward rock that Yancy had been known for. But the central pull of a more pure form of rock from the original members wouldn't be denied, and before long, Bill's lack of experience at drums was showing.

By this time, Gregg had introduced the band personally to J.C. Hall, Jr., whose sheer size, energy, and humor were an instant hit with the group, not to mention his impressive abilities as a singer and songwriter.
So after a number of gigs as a five-piece band, Bill Schmidt was replaced on drums by Leigh Carey, a flamboyant drummer who was everything on drums that Bill Schmidt wasn't, having come from an Eau Claire 3-piece band called World War III, and J.C. Hall joined on vocals and general crazyness. This third incarnation of Yancy Derringer proved to be a free-for-all circus that had no real direction, but it did have two or three lead vocalists, two guitars (sometimes 3 or 4), bass, keys, and a drummer who, while talented, tended to play like he was still in a three piece band.

After some gigging in this 6-man format, Gregg was becoming increasingly unhappy with the musical pandemonium, and the rest of the band was becoming unhappy with Leigh's overplaying. So Gregg decided to leave, and Leigh was replaced on drums by Yancy's original drummer, Lance Gnatzig. While still initially known as Yancy Derringer, the new band was powered-up, stripped-down, and built for speed. And Hall's creative influences were bringing so much more to the band than it had ever had before, that they all agreed that it simply wasn't Yancy Derringer anymore."

1074410,412111,3274690,Germany,Tiger B. Smith,We’re The Tiger Bunch,1974,35.0,9,"['LP', 'Album', 'Reissue']",['Rock'],"['Krautrock', 'Prog Rock']","
Tiger B. Smith was indeed a prominent German heavy rock band from Bad Camberg, known for their blend of progressive fuzz-blues rock and heavy, instrumental passages. Their music was heavily influenced by iconic bands such as The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Edgar Broughton Band, Hawkwind, and Black Sabbath. This eclectic mix of inspirations, combined with their dynamic performances, helped them carve out a unique sound in the early 1970s.
Holger Schmidt (vocals, guitar) was the core member of Tiger B. Smith and had a long history in the German rock scene. He started his musical journey with Groove in 1965, then went on to form Whiteface in 1968 and Second Life in 1969, which eventually evolved into Tiger B. Smith.
Klaus Meinhardt (bass) and Karl-Heinz Traut (drums) were the other key members of the group, staying with the band through its core years from 1967 to 1975 with some brief interruptions.
Tiger B. Smith’s style was marked by heavy fuzz guitar, long instrumental jams, and a progressive edge. They combined blues-rock foundations with the raw intensity of early heavy metal, a sound that was especially resonant with fans of hard rock bands from the late 60s and early 70s.
The group was often compared to Black Sabbath and Hawkwind, particularly for their heavier, fuzz-laden guitar work, while their use of long, exploratory jams and occasional spacey elements also drew parallels with Hawkwind’s psychedelic side. Their shows often included improvisation and spontaneous jams, making them a popular live act at the time. They played such notable bands as Deep Purple, Scorpions, UFO, and Nektar.
After disbanding in the mid-1970s, Holger Schmidt continued his musical career with projects like the Jon Bear Project (1975) and Tokyo (1984), but the pull of Tiger B. Smith remained strong, leading to a 2001 reunion. Despite not achieving widespread commercial success, the band's early work became influential in the European hard rock and progressive scenes.
Tiger B. Smith remains a cult favorite among fans of progressive and heavy rock, with their blend of fuzz, improvisation, and heavy riffs still holding appeal for those exploring 1970s German rock and its connection to the larger European and global music scenes of the time. Their participation in major European festivals and tours with bands like Suzi Quatro, Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, and The Spencer Davis Group further solidified their place in rock history.

The band emerged from the underground German rock scene with a very original and eccentric album called ""Phallus Dei"" (1969). The musicians who participated to this delirious and psychedelic experience were (among others) [a=Peter Leopold] (ex [a=Amon Düül]), the front woman and singer [a=Renate Knaup], [a=John Weinzierl] on the guitars... with guests as Holger Trützsch who plays tribal percussions (original member of [a=Popol Vuh]). Then almost with the same musicians the band recorded the seminal ""Yeti"" (1970). An album in a similar vein as the previous but more accomplished (with a couple of structured songs always with numerous pieces of epic improvisations). ""Yeti"" will launch Amon Düül II career outside Germany. The same year the bass guitarist Dave Anderson leaves the band to join [a=Hawkwind]. 

""Tanz Der Lemminge"" which follows directly ""Yeti"" is an impressive work with a great diversity of powerful, emotional songs with some folk accents next to long free space jamming. Recorded in 1972, ""Carnival in Babylon"" announces a slightly new musical direction taken by the band. This album is dominated by shorter songs with the omnipresent and beautiful vocals of Renate Knaup. A more conventional work with a few memorable prog-folk ballads. The classical period of the band will end with ""Wolf City"" (1972) and ""Vive La Trance"" (1973). After the departure of Renate Knaup who joins Popol Vuh in 1974 and the release of a few albums, Amon Düül II split up. In 1981, with the album ""Vortex"" and Renate Knaup rejoining Chris Karrer tried to reform the band without much success.

The band reformed again in 1995, releasing ""Nada Moonshine"" and performing in Europe and Japan.
Another comeback came in 2010 with the release of ""Bee As Such"" (later renamed ""Düülirium"") with the band performing again until 2018 so far. "

King Harvest was best known for their US hit single ""Dancing In The Moonlight"", released in 1972. Afterwards the group relocated from France to the US (Olcott, NY). 

At times, the group consisted of three keyboardists Altbach, Robinson, and Sherman Kelly, plus Tuleja on guitar, Novak on sax, Tony Cahill on bass, and David Montgomery on drums. All had been involved previously with other bands and done session work. In 1971, they released several singles in France on various labels, and the next year, they signed to the small Perception label. Their first single with Perception was Sherman Kelly's Dancing In The Moonlight, a soulful pop song that he and Robinson had performed with their earlier group, [a=Boffalongo]. It reached number 13 in the US in early 1973 but King Harvest's future singles were unable to match its success. Only one other single, A Little Bit Like Magic, charted, reaching number 91 in 1973.
The original line-up recorded two albums, the European exclusive [m701425], and [m322966], which mostly consists of songs from their debut album with a few songs swapped in. The latter was released in the US, and it reached number 136 on Billboard 200. The group made other singles through 1973 and 1974, but they disbanded shortly afterwards. A new version of the group was formed in 1975, and included four original members. With support from Beach Boys members Carl Wilson and Mike Love, they were signed to A&M Records and made another album, but, failing to achieve any hits, they subsequently broke up. Tuleja played on Dennis Wilson's 1977 solo album [m95177] while Altbach and Robinson performed with Love in his band [a311044]. King Harvest have reformed multiple times since 1975, though rarely releasing new music.

Salvation was formed in 1969 when New Jersey booking agent Jack Fisher merged 2 bands which were clients of his. A band out of Miami called the Miami Kids was losing their drummer and Jack recommended Arnett. Arnett, from New Jersey, had been working with a band called Max. They were a group which was concentrating on mostly original material with hopes of a recording contract and had already played as the opening group for the Allman Brothers Band. Max broke up after their guitar player quit with little notice. When Jack Fisher Asked Arnett to join the Miami Kids he agreed to do so only if the Kids also hired Max's lead singer Denis who was from St. Petersburg, Florida. The Miami Kids then had a new drummer and 2 lead singers Chuck and Denis. They played the entire summer at the Osprey Hotel in Manasquan, New Jersey and were a real hit with the fans. At the end of the summer however several of the band members decided to return to Miami, Florida which meant that Chuck, Denis and Arnett were now looking for a new backup group. They immediately contacted a New Jersey keyboard, guitar and bass player Russ Hope. Russ had been a member of Max. They also hired a New Jersey guitarist Freddie Cole as well as a trumpet and bass man Bobby Jay from New Jersey. It turns out that Denis also played the trombone so the band now had a horn section. Freddie was replaced eventually by the hottest guitar man in the New Jersey area Lenny Molinari. Another member was added at that same time. He was Louie Pietz from New Jersey. Louie was a talented musician who played the saxophone, flute, keyboards and bass guitar. The band was now really set and could play any kind of music and play it like no other band in the New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania area. They recorded a song ""Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life"" from the Broadway show Salvation and decided to rename the band Salvation. The rest is history. Salvation Summer (Their only LP) was released on Poverty label in 1975. They also recorded ""Overnight Success"" on Elektra label in 1977. Salvation went on to become the hottest band to ever perform in the area. They had a massive fan following and played the Jersey Shore at the Osprey Hotel for a total of 10 summers. There were lines more than a block long trying to squeeze in the see these super talented guys. The also had a similar following at Hunter Mountain ski area in upstate New York. Salvation played Ft. Lauderdale, Florida for spring break every year and had waiting lines there as well. They played at nightclubs all over New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania the rest of each year.

Dog Soldier were put together in mid-1974 by the renowned drummer Keef Hartley with two musicians with whom he had already previously played - the guitarist Miller Anderson (Keef Hartley Band) and the guitarist Derek Griffiths (Artwood) - plus the lesser knowns Paul Bliss (bass) and Mel Simpson (keyboards). The name of the group was taken from the Native American cultural tradition, which has always been a distinctive feature of Keef Hartley's history. The band signed to United Artists, which immediately began to push to produce a more commercial album compared to the different expectations of the quintet. Obviously all this generated tension and disagreements between the record label and the band. Dog Soldier recorded the album in late 74 at Island's Basing Street Studios in London which was later issued in June 1975. The music of the group is a warm and enveloping rock-blues with funky and hard veins. Infortunately Miller Anderson was hospitalised in January 1975 suffering from peritonitis, causing the cancellation of Dog Soldier's five scheduled UK gigs in that month. In the meantime a schism of sorts quickly developed between old stagers Hartley, Anderson and Griffiths on the one hand, and newbies Simpson and Bliss on the other. At this point inexorably the story took an increasingly worse turn, leading the band to an inevitable dissolution.

Enzo Vita (guitar), Stefano Urso (bass guitar) e Gino Campoli (drums), with Gianni Mereu (not the guitarist of ""Logan Dwight"") as lead singer first, then Sandro Falbo (from ""Le Rivelazioni"") and soon later Pino Ballarini, who had moved to Rome from Pescara where he played with ""Poema"".

First LP La Bibbia, released in 1971, was basically a very good hard-rock album with slight prog influences, recorded live in. The second one, Io come io (1972), was in the same style, with ambitious philosophical lyrics inspired from Hegel works. 

In 1973 a fifth member was added, keyboard player Franco Di Sabatino, briefly with ""Il Paese dei Balocchi"". With their sound enriched by the keyboards, Il Rovescio released the third album, Contaminazione, with the help of argentine composer [a157480], who had already worked with ""New Trolls"". The album was obviously more in a symphonic direction, and was also released in an English-sung version and issued in many foreign countries, to try to launch the group abroad.

By this time the band was being renowned for their powerful performances, always played at the loudest possible volume and helped by a unique sound system. But... in December 1973 the stealing of their big and expensive PA brought the band close to the end, with Pino Ballarini leaving for Switzerland (briefly replaced by Michele Zarrillo from [a1228989]) and the others continuing as an instrumental-only band. The live album Giudizio avrai, privately released by the band in the late 80's, contains a recording from this period, with the band's sound dominated by the keyboards.

Last release is a single from 1975 (there's a mention on its cover of a new album, but this was never released), then the band had various line-up changes up to 1977.

Subsequently, during the early part of the sixties, he was in Golden Apples Of The Sun, who signed to Andrew Loog Oldham’s Immediate label and released one single, Monkey Time, in 1965. Following that, Harrison formed the CBS-signed Powerpack, who put out two singles in 1966 and 1967. Backed by famous jazzman Ronnie Scott, Bobby also released his first record in his own name for CBS in the mid-sixties, a version of the song Sonny. Harrison then became one of the original members of Procol Harum during the spring of 1967, when the group recorded their famous No 1 single, A Whiter Shade Of Pale. However, at the same time as the record was at the top of the charts all over the world, Harrison and the band’s guitarist left the group to form their own outfit, Freedom. His solo album Funkist has material written for Freedom and is considered to be the ""missing link"" in Bobby Harrison’s career between Freedom and Snafu, which he formed early 1973. The band lasted until the mid 1970s. In the early eighties, Harrison decided to move to Iceland. There he got involved with many musical activities and also recorded one album with local supergroup Mezzoforte in 1987."

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon].

Víctor Yturbe (born Víctor Manuel De Anda Iturbe) was a Mexican singer, nicknamed ""El Pirulí"".

Yturbe was born in Mexico City. In the 1960s, he made his first contact with the artistic world, working as an aquatic clown in a water skiing show in Acapulco. After a spinal injury, he stayed in the Hotel Posada Vallarta in March 1964 where he started to sing professionally in the hotel's bar. Out of this experience came his first compositions, and in no time at all he recorded his first album, entitled ""Noches en el Posada Vallarta"", which included the popular track ""Puerto Vallarta"". Throughout his extensive career he recorded numerous albums, always with the collaboration of Chamin Correa, better known as the Primer Requinto de América, that have proven very successful in the 18 years since his death.
Yturbe left behind as his legacy numerous recordings, which years later, and digitally remastered, would be used by well-known musicians of Latin romantic music on a tribute CD with participants such as Cristian Castro (on the track Mil besos); Luis Fonsi (on the track Historia de un Amor) and Pandora (on the track Verdad Amarga), among many others.
Yturbe was murdered on November 28, 1987 in Atizapan de Zaragoza.[1] He was shot after he opened the door to his house. The cause was never established and no one has ever been charged with his killing."

Born: 4 January 1942 in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, England, UK.

A household name since the early 1970s, John McLaughlin was a fusion guitarist when he led the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra]. He started on guitar when he was 11 and was initially inspired by blues and swing players. He worked with [a=David Bowie], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Graham Bond], [a=Ginger Baker], and many others in the 1960s, and played free jazz with [a=Gunter Hampel] for six months. His first album was a classic, ""[m=75355]"" (1969), and was followed by an obscurity for the [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url] label with [a=John Surman], a quintet set with [a=Larry Young] on album ""[m=75603]"" (1970), and half acoustic solos and half jams involving Indian musicians on ""[m=75623]"" (1971).

In 1969, McLaughlin moved to New York to play with [a=Tony Williams]' [a=Lifetime] and he appeared on two classic [a=Miles Davis] records: ""[m=8408]"" (1969) and ""[m=8260]"" (1970). In 1971 McLaughlin formed the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra], a very powerful group often thought of as rock but having the sophisticated improvisations of jazz. After three influential albums – ""[m=72307]"" (1971), ""[m=72290]"" (1973), and ""[m=72279]"" (1973) – the group disbanded in late 1973.

McLaughlin, who recorded a powerful spiritual album with [a=Carlos Santana] that was influenced by [a=John Coltrane], put together a new Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1974 that, despite the inclusion of [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], failed to catch on and broke up by 1975. McLaughlin then surprised the music world by radically shifting directions, switching to acoustic guitar and playing Indian music with his group Shakti. They made a strong impact on the nascent world music scene during their three years. McLaughlin then went back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars; leading [a=The One Truth Band]; playing in trios with [a=Al DiMeola] and [a=Paco De Lucia]; popping up on some mid-1980s [a=Miles Davis] records; forming a short-lived third version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra with saxophonist [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/503619-Bill-Evans-3]Bill Evans[/url]; recording an introspective tribute to pianist [a=Bill Evans]; and in 1993, touring with a rollicking jazz trio featuring [a=Joey DeFrancesco] and drummer [a=Dennis Chambers].

Throughout his productive career McLaughlin has recorded as a leader across labels, including [l=Marmalade], [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url], [l=Douglas], [l=CBS], [l=Warner Brothers], and [l=Verve]."

Born: August 16, 1936, Greenville, South Carolina
Died: October 7, 2017, Georgia, USA

Roberts learned to play the 12-string guitar and blues harmonica, on which he claimed to have been tutored by [a=Sonny Terry].  In the early 1960s he went to Greenwich Village where he played on the street and in coffeehouses. It was during this time that he composed the song ""Hey, Joe,"" which he copyrighted in 1962. He soon moved to San Francisco, which would become his base of operations for the rest of his career. In 1964-1965, Roberts was part of a San Francisco-based folk trio called The Driftwood Singers, who performed at [l=the hungry i], opening for acts like [a=Bill Cosby], [a=Carmen McRae], [a=Godfrey Cambridge], and [a=Joan Rivers]. The group participated in an entertainment event at San Quentin Penitentiary on New Years Day 1965, which also included [a=Louis Armstrong], [a=Sarah Vaughan], and [a=Johnny Cash]. 

In 1965, Roberts was alerted by a friend to a recording of ""Hey Joe"" done by the Southern California rock band, [a=The Leaves]. Roberts had not heard of the recording and his friend ([a=Hillel Resner], later his producer) offered to ask his father, an attorney, to look into the matter. The attorney discovered that folk singer [a=Dino Valenti] had claimed authorship of the song and signed a publishing contract with [l=Third Story Music] of Los Angeles. This led to negotiations that resulted in Roberts retrieving his author's rights, but it did not prevent numerous recordings being released that named several other songwriters, in addition to Valenti, as the author. While residing in the Bay Area, Roberts performed in many of the local clubs. He was the opening act for the [a=Steve Miller Band] at the Straight Theater in Haight-Ashbury in September, 1967. He also opened for the [a=Santana] at a [a=Bill Graham (2)] Winterland concert in 1970. In 1975, Roberts recorded the country rock album [i]Thoughts of California[/i] with the band [a=Grits (2)] (which he produced with [a=Hillel Resner]).  He also owned Better Mousetrap Recording (an 8-track studio) which he mainly used for demo projects he and Resner were working on.

After a serious car accident in the early 1990s, Roberts was hospitalized in Sonoma County, California. He later moved to Atlanta, Georgia to undergo rehabilitation. Roberts did not perform or record ever since, but he held copyrights on nearly 100 songs."

The Tumbleweeds were founded in 1967 by Kaatsheuvel brothers Ad and Ton Masseurs , supplemented with Dick van Krimpen,  James Bordes and Manneke Jim Jaspers (replaced by Laura Bordes). Later joined their brother Berry Masseurs and their sister In Masseurs joined the band. 

In 1973 the band was the first European country band behind the Iron Curtain when they played a two-week tour of Romania.

In 1975, bassist John Koogje succeeded by Mickey De Boer and they recorded the following album with this line-up:
Ine Masseurs: vocals
Ruud Hermans: vocals
Ad Masseurs: drums
Mickey De Boer: bass
Berry Masseurs: rhythm guitar
Ton Masseurs: pedal steel guitar solo and
Ton Masseurs took over the production itself.

In 1974 and 1975 the group toured twice by the United States . They even performed at the Grand Ole Opry, the Carnegie Hall of country music. The band is also on the nomination list of Country Music Awards (for best group, best singer and best instrumentalists). The tour was warmly welcomed but a major breakthrough failed to materialize.

In 1977 drummer Ad Masseurs had a serious car accident en route to a gig in Germany. Afterwards, Ruud Hermans decided to leave the band to form his own band with a more pop-oriented country rock band. After that it slowly went downhill with the popularity of the band. 

In 1980 singer Ine Masseurs decided to focus on her family life and she left the band. 

After some attempts at a top 10 hit the group in 1982 broke up.

Ruskin learned well and is best known for his work with the guitar, but he has also performed as a vocalist and written a number of tunes. After appearing on many albums for other artists, Ruskin got the chance to complete a solo debut album of his own in 1974. The self-titled recording was released under the Takoma Records label. The album is filled with numbers like ""Break Out the Wine,"" ""Here Comes the Sun,"" ""Teddy Bear's Picnic,"" and ""The Temptation Rag."" Ruskin went on to record several other full-length works, including Microphone Fever, Six String Conspiracy, Words Fail Me, and others.

Over his long career Ruskin has written a songbook, The Takoma Sessions, and completed a few videos: Acoustic Fingerstyle Guitar, Fingerstyle Christmas Vol. 1, and Fingerstyle Christmas Vol. 2.

The live album was recorded on 24 January 1981 at Calvary Chapel, Costa Mesa, California, U.S. Both Malcolm and Alwyn released solo albums following the group's disbanding. Alwyn Wall featured on Larry Norman's 1981 live Friends on Tour album.
Their 1973 debut album Fool's Wisdom sported a stellar cast of session musicians including John Wetton of King Crimson on bass, Rod Edwards and Roger Hand of Edwards Hand on keyboards and percussion, veteran drummer Clem Cattini, and guitarist Mickey Keen of Hudson Ford.

They shopped a few songs and had songs cut, but nothing ever came of that.
Berry ran into a bunch of people in L.A. (Notably [a=George S.

This album, [r=1152228], received praise among critics but fell flat on its face commercially. Even with airplay, no one bought it outside of Colorado (thanks to massive airplay of Snowbound on at least one Colorado radio station), which was typical of the era in the music industry. Breaking unknowns seemed a crap shoot in those days and, having worked with many of the promo and A&R people during those times, it was no wonder.
He did have his option for a second album picked up and test pressings exist. One made it into the hands of a critic for either Phonograph Record or BAM and he raved but, alas, the record was not released.
Berry formed another band with George S. Clinton that went by the name of [i][a1522333][/i]. The band released one eponymous album in 1976.
Berry is reportedly in Nashville and is in the ministry, in some capacity."

Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1994 (Performer).

Born: 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, Lancashire, UK. 
Died: 8 December 1980 in NYC, NY, USA.

John Winston Ono Lennon (MBE, gave it back) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist, who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with [a=Paul McCartney] remains the most successful in musical history. In 1969, he started the [a=Plastic Ono Band] with his second wife, [a=Yoko Ono] (parents of [a=Sean Lennon]). After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.

Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [a=The Quarrymen], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterized for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1957 Lennon meets his first wife Cynthia Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art and then married her on the 23rd of August, 1962. On the 8th of April, 1963, Cynthia gave birth to Lennon's first son, [a=Julian Lennon]. In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967s [r=476958], his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.

From 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP [m=72864], and the international top 10 singles ""[r=1222236]"", ""[r=390001]"", ""[r=5324554]"" and ""[r=628431]"". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration [m=73013]. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, [a=Mark David Chapman], three weeks after the album's release. Lennon's ashes were scattered in New York's Central Park. A memorial was erected at the site of his ashes being scattered, named after a Beatles' song written by Lennon, ""[r=7278398]."""

Pederson and Gail Wallace remained contributors to the group throughout its existence, working on arrangements and occasionally recording.

By 1973, Blackmore had steered [a170355] through a significant personnel change, with [a349634] and [a123906] being replaced by [a369909] and [a267270]. However, the new members were keen to add new musical styles and Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned ""Black Sheep of the Family"" with ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves"" turned down by the band. He decided to record the song with [a291557] instead, using Dio's band [a312415] as additional musicians. He enjoyed the results, and a full album, billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood.

After the release of three studio albums and an extensive world tour in 1977–78, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the ""sword and sorcery"" theme. Dio did not agree with this change and left Rainbow. Together with then new vocalist [a353675], Blackmore scored a hit single with “Since You Been Gone”. 

After more lineup changes and albums, Ritchie disbanded Rainbow in early 1984 to rejoin the reunited Deep Purple.

He resurrected Rainbow once again in early 1994, just after leaving Deep Purple for good. However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [a485494] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [a298038]. 

Against all expectations, Blackmore reformed Rainbow, with an all-new line-up, in late 2015.

The group emerged from the Washington, D.C., folk scene of the late '60s, its roots dating back to the formation of the acoustic duo Fat City, comprised of future husband and wife Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert.
Together the couple wrote a song titled ""I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado,"" which was recorded by John Denver and Mary Travers; with Denver, they also penned the smash ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."" In 1969 Fat City recorded their debut LP, Reincarnation; after 1971's Welcome to Fat City the duo began working as simply Bill & Taffy, regularly opening for Denver on tour. 

On Bill & Taffy's second album, 1974's Aces, the duo enlisted 18-year-old singer and pianist Jon Carroll; the couple was so impressed by Carroll's performance they decided to form a new group, adding the youngster as well as vocalist Margot Chapman to become the Starland Vocal Band. They soon signed to Denver's Windsong label and in 1976 issued their self-titled debut LP, with the lead single ""Afternoon Delight"" quickly reaching the top of the charts on its way to helping earn them five Grammy nominations. (They won two, including Best New Artist.) ""Afternoon Delight"" was so enormously popular that the group even landed its own short-lived CBS variety series, The Starland Vocal Band Show, which featured a then-unknown David Letterman. 

The second Starland Vocal Band album, Rear View Mirror, followed in 1977, but failed to match the success of its predecessor; Late Nite Radio, issued a year later, also fared poorly by comparison, and after scoring one last minor chart entry with the single ""Loving You with My Eyes,"" the group disbanded in the wake of its fourth and final LP, 1980's 4 x 4. The Danoffs divorced in the wake of Starland Vocal Band's demise; Carroll and Chapman, who had also married at the peak of the group's success, later split up as well.

Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013.

He is a well known country rock performer, writer and co-writer of hit songs for other artists, most famously Linda Ronstadt and association of the Eagles band. He was married to [a=Alexandra Sliwin] from 1969-1972.

Souther was greatly influenced by Texan Roy Orbison, whose sound he tried to emulate. Following his move to Los Angeles in the late 1960s, he met a young guitarist from Detroit named Glenn Frey. They bonded over their Detroit roots and a common love of country and R&B music. In short order, they began working together while sharing a small apartment in Los Angeles' Echo Park area (their downstairs neighbor was Jackson Browne with whom both Souther and Frey would collaborate on numerous projects).

Shortly after meeting, Souther and Frey formed a folk duo called Longbranch Pennywhistle. Their lone album, released in 1970 on Jimmy Bowen's Amos Records, featured significant contributions from guitarists James Burton and Ry Cooder, fiddler Doug Kershaw, drummer Jim Gordon, pianist Larry Knechtel and bassist Joe Osborn.

After recording an eponymous solo album in 1972, persuaded by David Geffen, Souther teamed up with Chris Hillman and Richie Furay to form the Souther Hillman Furay Band The group released two albums, but creative tensions and lack of record sales (not to mention Furay's discomfort with playing secular music following his conversion to Christianity) led to the band's demise.

Souther is probably best known for his well-crafted songwriting abilities, especially in the field of country rock. He co-wrote some of the biggest hits for the Eagles, including ""Best of My Love"", ""Victim of Love"", ""Heartache Tonight"", and ""New Kid in Town"". ""How Long"", which appears on the Eagles Long Road Out Of Eden was written by Souther and originally recorded on his first solo album in 1972. He also produced Linda Ronstadt's ""Don't Cry Now"" album, and wrote songs for several of Ronstadt's multi-platinum albums, including ""Faithless Love"" from Heart Like a Wheel and ""White Rhythm and Blues"" included in her Living in the USA album. He also recorded several notable duets with Ronstadt, including ""Hasten Down the Wind,"" ""Prisoner in Disguise,"" and ""Sometimes You Can't Win."" He wrote ""Run Like a Thief,"" which appeared on Home Plate by Bonnie Raitt.

Souther has also contributed as a singer in works written by other artists, including backing vocals with Don Henley in ""The Light Is On"" by Christopher Cross on his eponymous debut album.

His biggest hit as a solo artist was his 1979 Orbison-influenced song ""You're Only Lonely"" from the album of the same name, which reached number 7 on the Billboard charts. A collaboration with James Taylor called ""Her Town Too"" from Taylor's Dad Loves His Work album reached number 11 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.

He was a contributor on the Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night 1987 concert and video, sang The Platters' ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" in the 1989 movie Always and sang the theme song to the 1989-1992 sitcom Anything But Love.

On October 14, 2008 Souther released If the World Was You, his first new release in 25 years. In the Fall of 2009, Souther released a follow up live CD entitled Rain - Live at the Belcourt Theatre, featuring a blend of old and new material.

As an actor, he has played several roles, including the character of John Dunaway in the (1989–1990) third season of the television drama thirtysomething and Ted in the film Postcards from the Edge (1990). He also performs in the audio book genre including the recent Jimmy Buffett sequel to Tales from Margaritaville, A Salty Piece of Land.

Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song ""Just for You"". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of ""Tell the Truth"", which was later withdrawn from sale (and is now a collectors item). He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. 

For a brief period in the mid 1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95.

One of Mason's best known songs is ""Feelin' Alright"", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote ""Hole in My Shoe"", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. ""We Just Disagree"", Mason's 1977 solo US hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of US classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.

In 2004, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic. Within the same year, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney."

However, the new members were keen to add new musical styles and Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned ""Black Sheep of the Family"" with ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves"" turned down by the band. He decided to record the song with [a291557] instead, using Dio's band [a312415] as additional musicians. He enjoyed the results, and a full album, billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood.

After the release of three studio albums and an extensive world tour in 1977–78, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the ""sword and sorcery"" theme. Dio did not agree with this change and left Rainbow. Together with then new vocalist [a353675], Blackmore scored a hit single with “Since You Been Gone”. 

After more lineup changes and albums, Ritchie disbanded Rainbow in early 1984 to rejoin the reunited Deep Purple.

He resurrected Rainbow once again in early 1994, just after leaving Deep Purple for good. However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [a485494] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [a298038]. 

Against all expectations, Blackmore reformed Rainbow, with an all-new line-up, in late 2015. Blackmore announced that he would play ""all rock"" concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner of 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow', his first rock shows since 1997.

Born with cataracts and glaucoma, and having several childhood accidents resulting in the removal of both eyes, Charlie (then known as Chuck) attended the New York State School for the Blind. It was there on a coal pile that he found a guitar. Grounded to his room for being off limits, he taught himself to play the guitar, and later formed a band with several classmates and an instructor at the school. Charlie later moved to the Southern Tier and hired a manager, John Parialis, with Pyramid Sound, based in Ithaca, NY. He began touring more widely, eventually being in the “right place at the right time” to fill in for the Eagles, whose transportation failed to get them to their gig as the opening act for Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Charlie’s music and charm impressed members of the band, who offered him a contract to continue the tour. With the stage name “Charlie Starr,” Charlie cut several single 45 rpm recordings as well as two albums, entitled “Just Plain Charlie” and “Tough and Tender.” Charlie rarely talked of his musical career in the later decades of his life, as his first love was Jesus. Abandoning fame and fortune to tune pianos and serve the Lord, Charlie left his musical career and dedicated his music and his life to the Lord."

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

The band played there every weekend from 1968, and got to open for acts like Led Zeppelin, Frank Zappa, Steppenwolf and other artists popular at the time.
Then disaster strikes for the band, as vocalist Billy Robbins; who was a charismatic frontman with no small part in the success they had achieved so far, went missing - and eventually turned up dead. Some time after the band starts searching for a new lead singer, and eventually settles on Lydia Janene Miller (aka Jamene Miller); a 16 year old highly talented vocalist with a rough, powerful voice in the tradition of Janis Joplin and Grace Slick.
Fantasy got signed to Liberty/United Artists shortly after, and their self-titled debut album is released in 1970.

153073,472920,3550157,US,Kiss,Destroys Anaheim,1977,0.0,8,"['LP', 'Unofficial Release']",['Rock'],['Heavy Metal'],"KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

He was a prolific writer who honed his craft with a spate of non-hit songs until he was asked to join the influential Johnny Winter Band as a backing musician, and then moved on to Johnny's brother Edgar Winter Group where he played bass and was given a free hand to participate in their monster collaboration ""They Only Come Out At Night"", a glam rock affair that defined the new rock ethos with the #1 pop hit ""Frankenstein"", and then sang lead on ""Free Ride"" in 1972. He continued to flourish, learning more instruments and then went solo in 1976. His label issued ""Who Is Dan Hartman and Why Is Everyone Saying Wonderful Things About Him?"", a promotional compilation of his tunes recorded with the Winters brothers. Soon, the brothers Winter were backing Hartman on his first true solo release, ""Images"" which introduced elements of Soul and R&B to his rapidly expanding repertoire. Keeping his toe in the rock arena, he recorded the Muddy Waters LP ""I'm Ready"" spending most of the time in the producers chair and adding a new sound to the blues legend repertoire. Hartman's songs usually had a steady beat, and in 1978 he released ""Instant Replay"" of which the title tune went to #1 disco (#29 pop), but contained a wide variety of sounds and beats that set the scene for his ""Relight My Fire"" LP in 1979. The centerpiece was ""Vertigo/Relight My Fire"", which spent 6 energy-fueled weeks at #1 on U.S. disco charts.

In 1981 Dan released ""It Hurts To Be In Love"" - an album which had moved away from the disco sound with melodic and almost Country Music tones. 

Success returned in 1984 with Dan's collaboration with Charlie Midnight and the release of ""I Can Dream About You"" from the film soundtrack of ""Streets of Fire"".  ""We are the Young"" and ""Second Nature"" were subsequently released from the album but did not make a big impression on the UK charts. In 1985 his song ""Get Outta Town"", from the Chevy Chase movie ""Fletch"" was released as a single and was included on the soundtrack album. Pressings of the UK only 12"" single included M&M mixes of ""I Can Dream About You"" but failed to ignite. Hartman and Midnight then collaborated on James Brown's ""Living In America"" that peaked at #3 dance and #4 US Pop in 1986. In 1989, he released his final LP, ""New Green Clear Blue"" a total departure from his pop influenced music with a foray into the ""New Age"" instrumental music.

After being diagnosed with HIV, Dan's last major production projects included tracks for Tina Turner, Dusty Springfield, Joe Cocker, Bonnie Tyler, Paul Young, James Brown, Nona Hendryx, Holly Johnson, Living in a Box, the Plasmatics and Steve Winwood. He died, in 1994 from an AIDS-related brain tumor just as his music was experiencing a revival.  Dance groups like Black Box used Loleatta Holloway's Dan Hartman produced voice sample on their huge hit  'Ride On Time', and then Take That recorded their own version of  ""Relight My Fire"" with Lulu in October 1993 that went to #1 in the UK. Hartman was secretive about his sexuality and HIV status, preferring to keep his private life to himself. Since his death, his songs ""I Can Dream About You"" and ""Relight My Fire"" were cleared for use in the Grand Theft Auto video games that brought his music to a new audience."

153073,538991,4313181,US,Kiss,Fried Alive!,1976,0.0,8,"['LP', 'Unofficial Release']",['Rock'],['Hard Rock'],"KISS was formed in Queens, New York (USA) in 1973. Often stylized [b]KIϟϟ[/b] they play rock, hard rock, heavy metal and 1980s hair/glam metal.

Easily identified by its members' face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 19 million have been certified by the RIAA, and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums.

Kiss trace their roots to [a=Wicked Lester (2)], a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Wicked Lester, with its eclectic mixture of musical styles, never achieved any success. They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York club scene, who was previously in bands called Lips and Chelsea. Criss auditioned for and joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. Inspired by the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, they also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.

In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley who impressed the group on his first audition, where he showed up wearing two different sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became Kiss.

The 1973–80 lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the ""Starchild"" because of his tendency to be referred to as the ""starry-eyed lover"" and ""hopeless romantic."" The ""Demon"" makeup reflected Simmons's cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley's ""Spaceman"" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss's ""Catman"" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley left the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes  also waned considerably by that point.

Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Kiss has been named on many lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"", 9th on ""The Greatest Metal Bands"" list by MTV, #1 on Hit Paraders's ""Top 100 Live Bands"", 56th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time"" and 2nd on Digital Dream Door's ""Best Hair Metal Bands"".

Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it in. Five years later, they were finally inducted.

The band's name – which is often spelled in all capital letters – has been rumored to have many secret meanings, among them an acronym for ""Knights In Satan's Service"" and ""Kids In Satan's Service"".

Because of the ambiguity in the distinction between ""hard rock"" and ""heavy metal"", Kiss' music has always been labeled one or the other. But shortly after the band's formation, critics called them ""thunderockers"". They also experimented in the disco/pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), art rock (Music from ""The Elder"") and grunge (Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions) styles. Their music is described by Allmusic as ""a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 80s."""

Richards was blinded in the left eye at the age of four in an archery accident, and lost sight in the right eye as well some years later. He first began playing in a group called The Five Pearls while still a teen in the 1950s. His first appearance on record was a single titled ""All About Ann"", released on Cincinnati, Ohio label Fraternity Records.

He moved to Los Angeles with an ensemble in the early 1960s, but his band failed and he returned to West Virginia. Later in the 1960s he moved to New York City. He played the uptown East Side local Bar's (Malachy's II) (72nd & Lexington) and eventually found success in New York. He released his debut album on Warner Bros. Records in 1970. He scored two minor hit singles in the US in the early 1970s. Further releases followed later in the decade, as did a third hit in 1980.

Richards made the first recording of Tom Snow and Nan O'Byrne's ""You Might Need Somebody"", which was subsequently a UK hit twice, reaching number 11 hit for Randy Crawford in 1981 and number 4 for Shola Ama in 1997.

Shadowfax was formed in Chicago in 1972 as a blues band by saxophonist [a=Chuck Greenberg], guitarist [a=G.E. Stinson] and bassist [a=Phil Maggini].  The band took its name from Gandalf's silvery-grey horse in [a=J.R.R. Tolkien]'s ""Lord of the Rings.""  During the 1970s they moved to a style heavily influenced by progressive rock mixed with elements of world music, folk, jazz and even classical chamber music. Their early music was characterized by very strong guitar work and a definite rock edge.  Their only release in this style was their debut album, ""Watercourse Way"", initially released by [l=Passport Records] in 1976.

Shadowfax found a wider audience when they signed with [l=Windham Hill Records] in 1982.  Their self-titled second album featured a softer sound, heavy on jazz and world music influences.  It reached number 19 on the Billboard jazz chart.  Subsequent Shadowfax albums would reach the top 10 on jazz and new age charts and also chart on the Billboard Hot 200.

Shadowfax won a Grammy Award for the 1988 album ""Folk Songs For A Nuclear Village.""  They also received a Grammy nomination for the 1992 album ""Esperanto.""

Shadowfax' signature sound was largely built around Chuck Greenberg's lyricon and woodwinds.  On September 4, 1995 Greenberg died of a heart attack and the group disbanded.

The one review I found was twelve words long (and not a complete sentence).

The line-up featured singer Laurie Kaye Cohen (who had recorded an obscure solo album for Playboys' brief foray into the music business (1973's ""Under the Skunk"" catalog number PB 111), rhythm guitarist Ron Elliott, drummer Bruce Gary, lead guitarist John Platania and bassist Karl ""Slick"" Rucker. They were signed to Neil Bogart's disco-oriented Casablanca Records and their 1976 album ""Thanks for the Music"" teamed them with producer/engineer (and former Earth Opera bassist) John Nagy. The eleven songs were all original compositions with Cohen, Elliott and Paltania each contributing material. Tracks like 'Lousy Day', 'Rock Roadie Road' and 'Get Off My Back (Bitch)' offered up a decent collection of '70s bar band rockers. The material was all quite commercial with radio potential, but it was also quite anonymous. Most Gen Xers will have heard similar ""corporate"" rock all over the place. Arguably the band's most unique features came in the form of Plantania's guitar work. On tracks like 'Unemployed' his slide guitar reminded me of Ry Cooder. He was also an amazing fast player. The other feature was Cohen's voice. He may have been the smallest member of the band, but Cohen had a great rock and roll voice. Deep and rugged, comparisons to Tony Joe White and the late Joe Cocker (without his twitchy English eccentricities and excesses) were not out of place. I actually thought a couple of these tracks were really good. Perhaps because it had kind of an early Doobie Brothers vibe 'Rock Roadie Road' would have made a great FM single. Powered by Platania's slide guitar and Rucker's thumb popping bass, the funky 'Unemployed' was equally impressive. Far from a great album, but not the throwaway some folks would have you beieve. 

Busy making millions off their disco acts, Casablanca Records had no interest in the band and the album quickly vanished into oblivion.  "

Their profound impact on rock and roll was acknowledged in 1988 when they were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame as a group. By 2015, each member had also received individual recognition for their contributions as solo artists within the Hall of Fame."

Their biggest success, however, came in the 70s, when they stopped covering foreign songs as they started to record their own songs.

Later, he teamed up with singer and producer [a305228], but success would come on its own accord with his own music works. 

Camilo Sesto sold over 175 million albums worldwide, excluding sales of all the other artists he helped produce.

Guthrie Thomas has written over one thousand published lyrical songs and a hundred or more instrumental compositions. He was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, and raised on a horse ranch in the rodeo days of the genuine American cowboy. He plays seven different styles of music.

Thomas' career has spanned 45 years, 60 albums, 3 motion pictures, as well as television. He has recorded and performed with some of the most elite musicians around the world. Ramblin' Jack Elliott discovered Thomas in a Northern California cafe' and bar bringing Thomas to Hollywood where his music career began. Ramblin' Jack Elliott's generous help and guidance in Hollywood Thomas soon gained the attention of many of the highest profile notables and was soon considered one of the most prolific songwriters and exceptional guitarists in the music industry. As Thomas likes to say, ""Had it not been for Jack Elliott, I'd probably be selling guitar strings in a lost guitar shop North of Frisco. Though there were many friends who assisted me on my journey in recording, most certainly, Raynold Gideon, Hoyt Axton, Mark Dawson, Arlo Guthrie, John Hartford, as well as, David Foster, David Paich, Ringo Starr, Willie Nelson, Tommy Smothers, Don Novello, Nicolette Larson, Marc Stein, Peter Asher, and a large host of others, still it was Jack that was the one who gave me my start. The famed Screen Writer and Motion Picture Producer, Raynold Gideon, produced Thomas’ first Album, ""Sittin' Crooked,"" after hearing Thomas play a few songs when Thomas and close friend, actor Steve McQueen, visited a Pacific Coast Highway restaurant just North of Malibu Beach Colony in California in 1974. However, Thomas began his hopes of becoming a recording artist in London, England, playing in the subways of London as passengers came to and from their trains in 1968. Thomas' father gave him his first guitar, a Gibson acoustic 12 string.

However, Thomas' talents do not end with music and songwriting. Thomas is also a registered pharmacist; a psychologist; an author; an actor; a painter; a music director, and record producer. Thomas also maintains and oversees The Guthrie Thomas Companies, Alnilam Records, The Guthrie Thomas Guitar Pick Company, and is considered by many to be one of the finest singer-songwriter, acoustic guitarists in the world.

Thomas lives a reclusive lifestyle and rarely tours but publically shares, ""Never forget that fame is just a word that few truly understand, and for most, only a few short moments in their lives if the specter does present itself but, artistic expression well done is something no one ever forgets.""

""If you want to learn, you must learn to listen and take it all very slow. Life in the fast lane will kill you fast and I have worked with many artists that sadly came to find that this train was the fastest and last train they boarded. This train is as black as midnight with no moon, no conductor, and no engineer. This train travels only one way and is nonstop, and those traveling on this train never knew they boarded this runaway train on its cold steel tracks to purgatory, meaning, don't give up until you are dead, but don't kill yourself trying...""

Although it was an excellent effort, the combination of the wrong label (Barnaby was not a ""rock"" label, being otherwise occupied with Everly Brothers reissues and Ray Stevens LPs, and didn't know how to promote them) and the wrong distributor (MGM was in the midst of its infamous artist purge and in preliminary sale talks with PolyGram) cause the record to sink.

There are many bands or groups today yet few that are considered a musical institution. The Embers have solidified their position as a thriving musical entity leaving their mark on listeners for decades.

The Embers boast numerous albums and single releases that span decades and all the crazes continuing to exhibit top quality showmanship, musicianship and professionalism. Having been inducted into the South Carolina Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame and most recently the South Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame, The Embers are honored to carry the moniker of North Carolina’s Official Ambassadors of Music. This group has traveled the country and the world and have performed for every event imaginable from the highest dignitaries to the hottest back yard frat parties. The Embers were also honored to travel throughout South Korea to perform their Christmas special ‘Christmas with the Embers’ on American Military bases for America’s troops in December of 2007 and 2008. The Embers were awarded Military Coins of Excellence for their distinguished service.

The Embers are widely considered a musical marvel and have laid the groundwork for what has become known as ‘Beach Music’ in the Carolinas, Virginias, the gulf coast region of North America and every beach in between. A true musical tradition with which many Americans have grown. The Embers consider the genre of Beach Music as “music with a memory” and have been creating lasting memories since its inception in 1958. Simply put – Heart and Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Feel Good Music.

Today, touring is commonplace for The Embers regularly boasting an average of 225 shows per year. The Embers also embark on a cruise each year for their friends and fans to various locations throughout the Caribbean. The Embers also continue their tradition of Christmas shows throughout the holiday season this year celebrating their 8th consecutive season!

On 5 February 2021, they announced to the Dutch press their active career was over, due to George Kooymans' illness.

They were soon joined by Bob ""Bongo"" Starkie on guitar and backing vocals, and Red Symons on guitar, vocals and keyboards; Graeme ""Shirley"" Strachan became lead vocalist in March 1974. Described as a glam rock band, because of flamboyant costumes and make-up, Skyhooks addressed issues including buying drugs in ""Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)"", sex and commitment in ""Balwyn Calling"", the gay scene in ""Toorak Cowboy"" and loss of girlfriends in ""Somewhere in Sydney"" by namechecking Australian locales.

Skyhooks had No. 1 albums on the Australian Kent Music Report with their 1974 debut, Living in the 70's (for 16 weeks), and its 1975 follow-up, Ego Is Not a Dirty Word (11 weeks). Their No. 1 singles were ""Horror Movie"" (January 1975) and ""Jukebox in Siberia"" (November 1990)."

In 1962, he became the frontman for [a5350229], a Welsh beat group and recorded 4 demo tracks in the football changing rooms at Pontypridd YMCA, known as the ""bathroom session"". In 1963, as Tommy Scott & The Playboys, they recorded 7 demos for the producer [a226551]. In 1964, the then Tommy Scott & The Squires, met [a276718], who became Tom's manager from 1964-1986. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [a325671] film [i]Tom Jones[/i] (1963), Mills made the decision to rename Jones. Mills also wrote and scored the first of Jones' many Transatlantic top 10 hits, ""It's Not Unusual"". By the end of the 1960s, Jones was a top 5 all-time Las Vegas headliner (1968-2010) and was playing sold out venues around the world.

From 1969 until 1971, Jones had an internationally successful television show, [i]This Is Tom Jones[/i]. Though his record sales tailed off during the mid-1970s, peaking in 1971 with his only US No. 1 hit, ""She's A Lady"", he remained a huge draw as a live performer. In 1970, Jones was the first solo performer to sell out [l240090]. In 1979, he made his acting debut and starred in the made-for-TV movie, [i]Pleasure Cove[/i]. A decade earlier, a press release was issued about a possible film starring Jones and [a27518] but this project was never realized.

In 1986, Gordon Mills died and Jones' son [a1933944] became his manager. In 1987, Jones returned to the UK and quickly re-established himself as a recording artist with a song that reached No. 2, ""A Boy From Nowhere"" (from the unstaged musical ""Matador""). In 1988, he made his ""comeback"", collaborating with [a7142] on ""Kiss"", written by [a28795]. It proved a worldwide hit and won an MTV award.

The 1990s proved Jones' versatility as he collaborated with numerous well known artists, culminating with the 1999 album ""Reload"". It reached No. 1 in the UK (in both 1999 and 2000) and was awarded album of the year and became his biggest selling album to date (as of 2016). This was achieved without any US sales, as the album was not released in the US due to collaborating artist copyright restrictions. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and knighted in 2006 for his services to music. In 2009, Jones headlined UK's Glastonbury Festival.

With worldwide sales topping 400 million and counting, Tom Jones ranks among the top 10 biggest selling artists of all time.

The group emerged from the Washington, D.C., folk scene of the late '60s, its roots dating back to the formation of the acoustic duo Fat City, comprised of future husband and wife Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert.
Together the couple wrote a song titled ""I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado,"" which was recorded by John Denver and Mary Travers; with Denver, they also penned the smash ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."" In 1969 Fat City recorded their debut LP, Reincarnation; after 1971's Welcome to Fat City the duo began working as simply Bill & Taffy, regularly opening for Denver on tour. 

On Bill & Taffy's second album, 1974's Aces, the duo enlisted 18-year-old singer and pianist Jon Carroll; the couple was so impressed by Carroll's performance they decided to form a new group, adding the youngster as well as vocalist Margot Chapman to become the Starland Vocal Band. They soon signed to Denver's Windsong label and in 1976 issued their self-titled debut LP, with the lead single ""Afternoon Delight"" quickly reaching the top of the charts on its way to helping earn them five Grammy nominations. (They won two, including Best New Artist.) ""Afternoon Delight"" was so enormously popular that the group even landed its own short-lived CBS variety series, The Starland Vocal Band Show, which featured a then-unknown David Letterman. 

The second Starland Vocal Band album, Rear View Mirror, followed in 1977, but failed to match the success of its predecessor; Late Nite Radio, issued a year later, also fared poorly by comparison, and after scoring one last minor chart entry with the single ""Loving You with My Eyes,"" the group disbanded in the wake of its fourth and final LP, 1980's 4 x 4. The Danoffs divorced in the wake of Starland Vocal Band's demise; Carroll and Chapman, who had also married at the peak of the group's success, later split up as well. All four members of the group later went on to mount solo careers, though never again recapturing the success of ""Afternoon Delight."" ~ Jason Ankeny"

With that name the band certainly became a part of a special musical family. The founding members of the band, brothers, Dennis and Russell Gulley, along with friend, Tommy Patterson, migrated from Fort Payne, Alabama to the Shoals after several years of working on the road with both regional and national acts, such as Cross from Birmingham and Ruby Winters (Polydor Records recording artist). The Gulley brothers came out of a background of Southern Gospel music, while Patterson was a music student in college. All were searching for a future in music as artists and /or songwriters. Shortly after getting to Muscle Shoals Sound, the trio was joined by guitarist Britt Meacham, and drummer, Ronnie Vance, a native of Florence, Alabama. Britt was a native of Memphis, but had settled in Mobile, Alabama with his new wife, Cheryl. Britt had previously worked with Bell Records recording act, Storm, a rock trio produced by Barry Beckett at MSS (Muscle Shoals Sound). Mike O'rear, the publishing administrator for MSS, was put in charge of demoing the new arrivals for the publishing company and became instrumental in supporting the band members by getting them a house band gig across the Ala.Tenn. state line at a club called Johnny's Club. The band worked there from 1973 till about 1977, when they released their first LP on the Muscle Shoals Sound label, simply titled , ""Jackson Highway"". With the release of their first recording, Jackson Highway began a hard journey that kept them constantly touring throughout the South , colleges, clubs, concert dates, where ever anyone would listen to them. In 1980, their hard work finally paid off with a second LP, produced by the same MSS team of Jimmy Johnson and David Hood. This time the LP was on the MSS/Capitol label. To support the record, the band toured with Ted Nugent, UFO, Triumph, and opened for groups, such as Blackfoot. When Capitol, did not pick up the band's option, the group then moved to Nashville, at the suggestion of hometown friends, the Country Supergroup, ALABAMA. This time, keyboardist, Tommy Patterson chose to stay in Muscle Shoals to do sessions and work for the recording studios. In 1986, after some 13 years together, the band officially disbanded. Since then, the various members have remained in touch, even performing with each other on occasion, and each continues to maintain a musical career. Dennis, lives in Nashville, manages a recording studio with partner, Johnny Neel, formerly of The Allman Brothers and Gov't Mule, and performs at Nashville clubs. He's also toured with ALABAMA and The Moffits. Tommy Patterson is still in Muscle Shoals, works at the recording studios in computer programming, piano tuning, and sessions, gigs locally as well as on the road, with such stars as the legendary, Little Richard. Britt Meacham, lives in Mobile and tours/records regularly with Malaco/Waldoxy Records group, The Beat Daddys. Britt has also toured overseas with Blues Legend, Little Milton. Of course Britt is also famous for supplying some famous guitar licks on the giant rock and roll recording by Bob Seger, Old Time Rock and Roll. Russell Gulley continues to perform and record. He,also is involved with the arts community as a folklorist and community arts administrator. He serves on the board of the Alabama Folklife Association, is active in arts in education programming, and has served his hometown of Fort Payne, as one of the organizers of an annual festival, The Boom Days Heritage Celebration. Ronnie Vance, still resides in Florence, where he is a successful businessman and entrepreneur."

They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whippoorwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time."

In the early Eighties he was invited to join the cast of “ABBAcadabra”, a musical inspired by ABBA songs. His song called “Mon nez, mon nez” (My nose, my nose) was set to the music of “Money Money Money”. In 1987 he represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song “Amour Amour”. It scored 4 points, placing 21st out of 22. In 1988 he had a hit with “Slave To The Beat”, which sold quite well and was one of the many 80’s covers that the “Presidents of the United States of America” used to bang out at live gigs.

He has now almost entirely disappeared from the musical scene and is busy with his own art gallery. He reappeared on the radar in 2005 joining the cast of a French variation on “Celebrity Big Brother”."

He was born in 1954 in Topeka, Kansas but raised in Kansas City, Missouri, USA.

Nigro began with the typically teenage pursuit of fronting his own high school band, Norwegian Wood, and several other short-lived combos followed.  His first recording was a 7-Inch acetate for [l=Damon (3)] in Kansas City, limited to five copies, with the songs ""Journey to Find Who We Are"" and ""To You"".  Next, via an ad in a Kansas City newspaper, he happened upon the opportunity of studio work at age 20.  During the next few years at the subterranean [l=Liberty Recording Studios (2)] - where [r1658872] was recorded in 1976—and [l=Big K Records] (where it was mixed in 1977) he worked steadily, recording as a labor of economy during studio off-hours when he was given free reign.   The eponymous titled debut LP [r1658872] was released on the [l=Big K Records (3)] subsidiary [l=Guinn Records] in 1977.    It quickly disappeared into obscurity.  Years later, record collectors began finding copies of the album and it began appearing on collector's want lists.   Since its discovery by fringe-searchers it has been christened a heavy-hitter in the pantheon of “out-of-time” treasures.  Self-produced and nearly fully self-created, Michael Angelo is a staggering, hook-filled, inner space hi-fi snapshot of dreamy folk-rock, Anglophile-pop and light psychedelia, filled with contemplative, arresting lyrical imagery and carries little to ally it to its time (spare some shimmering keyboards).  It has been reissued four time since the late 1990s, including most recently by [l=Anthology Recordings] in 2015.  

In the early 1990s he formed a band [a=Synifus] with Kansas City musicians [a=Rusty Crewse] and [a=Paul Allee] and released the album [r10565626] on cassette tape in 1991 and [r10565715] in 1994.  1999 saw [l=Void Records (3)] release an album of unreleased material from the same [r1658872] 1976 recording sessions and [l=Mexican Summer] made available two of the tracks on the [r2473472] 7-Inch Single in 2010.  2016 saw the reforming of the band [a=Synifus] with longtime friends Crewse and Allee, this time calling themselves [a=Michael Angelo's Dreamfeast] from the song ""Dreamfeast"" by Synifus.  The band made appearances at the music festivals Montreal Pop and Outer Reaches, performing tracks from the 1977 self-titled album live for the first time ever.  In 2017, the group released their first album [r10559429]."

In May 1983, Phil Rudd had a parting of the ways and was replaced by Simon Wright (drums), aged 20 then. November 1989 Simon Wright left and is replaced by Chris Slade (ex Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Uriah Heep & The Firm).

In 1974,  Mad Dog was asked to open for Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band and MC5 at the Skidway Lake Music Festival. The band played all original material and was making a name for itself. In 1975 the group was again asked to open for Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band in Saginaw, Mi. at a club called Hidden Hollow.  In 1976 Mad Dog recorded its first album.  After a trip to New York and a slew of rejection letters from the major labels, the band released the record in 1977. The album received airplay and made numerous college radio station playlists during 1977 -1978. Commercial radio was not 
into music this heavy at the time.  Distribution was a problem and the internet did not exist.  Indie labels were few and far between.

The band formed in 1968. Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some band members believe that their music cannot be categorised as belonging to any one genre. They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as ""the loudest pop group"", and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.

There has been a Deep Purple band in existence since the late 60s, apart from the eight years between 1976 when Mark IV split up and 1984 when Mark II reformed.

Frangenberg left in 1970 and was replaced by [a=Hans Pape].  They were signed by EMI Records and recorded the album, ""Mediterranean Tales (Across The Waters)"", released in 1972 on Harvest/EMI.  During the making of the second album, ""Illusions On A Double Dimple"" (1974), Pape left and was replaced by [a=Helmut Köllen]. EMI sent a copy to Capitol Records who released the album in the U.S, where it received significant airplay.  A U.S. tour followed with Triumvirat opening for [a=Fleetwood Mac].  The next album, ""Spartacus"" (1975), gave Triumvirat their greatest chart success.  

At the end of the U.S. tour of ""Spartacus"" Köllen left to pursue a solo career.  Dick Frangenberg rejoined on bass and [a=Barry Palmer] was the new lead vocalist.  This quartet recorded ""Old Loves Die Hard"" (1976), which was far less successful than it's predecessors. There was no supporting tour and Triumvirat broke up.  In 1976 Fritz and Köllen were working together again on a new Triumvirat album: ""Pompeii"" (1977). Köllen felt some of the material was outside his vocal range and Palmer was invited to rejoin the group.  Köllen's death in February, 1977 left Palmer with all the vocal duties.  Bassist [a262168] and drummer [a=Curt Cress] rounded out the band which was briefly renamed ""New Triumvirat"" due to a legal dispute between Fritz and Bathelt.  

By 1978 progressive rock was no longer popular.  Fritz released two unsuccessful pop albums as Triumvirat with an ever shifting supporting lineup.  In 1999 Fritz tried to revive Triumvirat with Curt Cress rejoining the group on drums.  They recorded a new album, ""Website Story"", which remains unreleased.

The group originally played current Top 40 covers mixed with originals through their days as Goodie Two Shoes. When the headliner was running late at a 1971 GTS gig, the promoter asked them to extend their set and they performed a medley of Beach Boys tunes they'd played around with In rehearsals. Crowd reaction was positive and shortly thereafter they changed the name to Papa Doo Ron Da Run with the setlist becoming 60s pop covers with a ""beach party"" concert theme. The band has recorded ten albums including one of original compositions.

Soon they were able to cover this challenging prog material with ease and friends started to encourage them to write some original music. This material, written by Blair and Bess, was to make up the basis of the bands lone album which was a conceptual fantasy-themed work called ""Assault on Merryland.""

In 1959 he scored two #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, “Venus” and “Why”. Because of his youth, he was one of the first to be classified as a “Teen Idol”. He had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including “Just Ask Your Heart” (#7), “I’ll Wait For You” (#15), “Bobby Sox To Stockings” (#8), and “A Boy Without A Girl” (#10).

In the 1978 film “Grease” he performed “Beauty School Dropout” as a character called Teen Angel. 
Following an appearance on “American Bandstand” anniversary broadcast, Avalon, Fabian, and Bobby Rydell went on several long running tours of the US in the 1980s and 1990s, performing their old hits and medleys of other songs.

It's nothing more than speculation on my part, by I'm guessing these ten tracks reflected early-1970 studio demos recorded with various New York studio vocalists that Tomorrow management somehow got their hands on and subsequently repackaged with little thought for after-sales. From both a business and artistic stance this set was a little bit different in that it found Tomorrow taking a measured risk by 'borrowing' the work of a known artist.  Unlike most tax scam albums which released material by unknown quantities, this collection essentially served as a Carole King tribute.  Nine of the ten tracks were King compositions with many of the tracks being remakes of material off of her 1971 ""Tapestry"" album.  At least on the surface, recording an album of King covers would seem to have increased the chances of someone in King's circle learning about the album and seeking royalties, or pursuing legal remedies.  Obviously it was a risk Tomorrow was willing to take.  Makes you wonder if King knows this album exists..."

In addition to playing guitar and providing all of the lead vocals on ‘Cream City’, Butler also carried out the majority of the writing (with help from Goldstein on some songs). Highlighting Butler's appreciation of Sly & the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Ike & Tina Turner, and the Isley Brothers, among others, ‘Cream City’ was a soul-funk gem with a prominent rock influence. Unfortunately, the 1977 release wasn't the major hit it deserved to be and Butler's group never recorded a second album, although he continued to perform around Los Angeles in the late '70s and '80s.

 Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, and was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".
Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud but clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his effect on the blues genre, on helping to influence the revived production of the guitar, and on many other guitarists.

In 1969, Frank Zappa heard The Persuasions singing live over the phone in a New Jersey record shop, picked his jaw up off the ground and promptly flew the group to Los Angeles to record their first album “A Cappella”. Thus began a 25-album recording career that focused on R&B, Soul, Pop, Rock ‘n’ Roll, but eventually included full album tributes to Frank Zappa, The Grateful Dead and The Beatles. The group even recorded a children’s album, “On The Good Ship Lollipop,” winner of many parents’ group awards. Through it all, The Persuasions’ sound was crowned by Jerry Lawson’s sweet and smoky lead baritone, (which began as a tenor), his effortlessly organic vocal arrangements, and his electrifying stage charisma. Critics often place Lawson’s inspired phrasing in a context with Sam Cooke, Brook Benton, and Otis Redding.

Modern vocal groups such as Take 6, Rockapella, The Nylons and Boys II Men all cited “The Kings of A Cappella” as a primary influence. The L.A. Weekly once wrote, “The Persuasions are to singing what Muhammad Ali was to boxing—invincible, innovative, original, beautiful.”

The five Persuasions—Jerry Lawson, Jimmy Hayes, Joe Russell, Jayotis Washington, and Herbert “Toubo” Rhoad—fell together by chance in 1962, harmonizing on outdoor basketball courts in Brooklyn after pick-up games. They went on to release 25 albums and to perform or record with artists including Liza Minnelli, Bette Midler, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Van Morrison, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle, Little Richard, Nancy Wilson, The Neville Brothers, Country Joe McDonald, B.B. King, John Hiatt, Leon Redbone. Their music has turned up in films from “Joe and the Volcano” to “The Heartbreak Kid,” “Streets of Gold,” and “E.T.”

The Persuasions’ first record deal was with Frank Zappa in 1968. He “discovered” them over the phone when their friend (and eventual producer) David Dashev, phoned Zappa from a New York studio, declaring, “you’ve got to hear this.” They debuted to the world with the LP, A Cappella on Zappa’s Straight label. Said Zappa many years later ” I could tell, even over the phone, that these guys were something special. Rock critic and author Greil Marcus once called The Persuasions’ style a “perfect marriage of passion and intelligence,” and Rolling Stone rated their 1977 album, Chirpin’, as one of the hundred best works of the 1970s. Mix Magazine proclaimed “The Persuasions are four parts of one voice, one spirit.” Cash Box correctly noted, in 1996, “These all-vocal, instrument-free heroes paved the way for today’s platinum A Cappella acts, Take 6, and Bobby McFerrin, as well as the retro-hip-hop styles of Boyz II Men, and Pentatonix.”

Following their Straight album, The Persuasions signed with Capitol and recorded three of the most arresting vocal albums ever made: We Came to Play, Spread the Word, and Street Corner Symphony. They covered tunes by Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Kurt Weill, Curtis Mayfield, The Temptations, Joe South, Rogers and Hammerstein, Lennon and McCartney. This eclectic mix of material and genre was a direct reflection of Lawson’s taste in music, and became a template for the many Persuasions albums that were to follow, culminating in the 1990’s with a gospel album, a children’s album, and acclaimed tribute albums to Frank Zappa, The Beatles, and The Grateful Dead.

These were singers in the tradition of great gospel A Cappella groups such as The Golden Gate Quartet and The Fairfield Four, but the Persuasions advanced the art form into a percolating, pulsing, street-edged meld of rock ‘n’ roll, soul, country, blues. . .In short, they “Persuasionized” any songs that suited them, and made them their own—from “Papa Oom Mow Mow” (heard in “E.T.”) to “Curtis Mayfield’s “Man Oh Man” to Kurt Weill’s “Oh Heavenly Salvation.” Lawson adapted a huge range of popular music to A Cappella style, with his own original arrangements, and co-produced Persuasions and recordings. He was an electrifying front man who also had the gift of gab. Some of his between-song patter was simply great stand-up comedy. The other members of the group all made vital contributions to the unique Persuasions sound. Jimmy Hayes’ silky bass-singing was and is without peer in all Contemporary A Cappella history—perhaps all A Cappella history. “Sweet Joe” Russell’s mighty harmonies and occasional leads were essential to the overall Persuasions sound. Jayotis Washington’s elastic tenor provided contrast on occasional novelty tunes, and Toubo Rhoad’s “invisible” baritone sort of held the proceedings together.

Though discovered by college radio in the early ’70s, championed by Barry “Dr. Demento” Hansen (who had them record his theme song), they got little more than token FM airplay on the west coast in the ’70’s, while in New York they were being played constantly by Frankie Crocker on WBLS. Their albums were often wrongly relegated to “Doo Wop” and “oldies” bins in record stores. Still, they carried on, building a deeply devoted audience and touring the world. Their live performances remain the stuff of legend (thankfully borne out by various audience recordings and Wolfgang’s Vault shows.) Incredibly, Bruce Springsteen opened for The Persuasions on more than one occasion. In 1979 The Persuasions became an integral part of Joni Mitchell’s legendary “Shadows and Light” tour.

Throughout the 60s, 70s, and most of the 80s, The Persuasions preached the A Cappella gospel almost entirely alone—certainly the secular, eclectic A Cappella gospel. Although they didn’t know it, they had created the genre that is today known as Contemporary A Cappella.

Perhaps, to really understand the impact of this American musical institution, it is best to quote Tom Waits, who famously remarked: “These guys are deep sea divers. I’m just a fisherman in a boat.”

Footnote:
There is a group calling itself “The Persuasions,” trading on well-known Persuasions repertory and arrangements today. They are effectively a tribute group that includes one member of the original five, Jayotis Washington. The leader of this group was never authorized by all original group members to use the name, “Persuasions.” Having one original member, and still claiming the original name seems unfair to audiences who will not know the difference between the authentic Persuasions and this group. Recordings and live performances after 2003 are not the work of the original, renowned A Cappella group, The Persuasions.*

*Except the albums, “The Persuasions Live at McCabe’s,” and “Persuasions of the Dead.”"

In 1964, Wilson formed his first band [a302923] and in 1965 released a cover version of ""Louie Louie"", a bona fide garage band record, and possibly Australia's first independent single. His next band was [a1542574] between 1967-1969. In 1969, he formed [a762487]. In 1970, four members of this group formed a side-project named Daddy Cool. After Daddy Cool broke up in late 1972, Wilson became involved in the production of many Australian bands, including the 1970s group [a327752]. In 1976, he formed [a221490], initially to promote a single that he had recorded and it wasn't until 1978 that they issued their debut single. In 1983, his former wife [a551186] had a Number 1 hit in Australia with ""Bop Girl"" which he wrote and co-produced. After Mondo Rock disbanded in 1990, Wilson pursued a solo career as well as performing in side projects, such as the power-funk outfit RAW (1991-1993).

The group was composed of two former members of The Imperials, Sherman Andrus and Terry Blackwood as co-lead vocalists. Rounding out the group's first touring band in 1977 were Rocky Laughlin on bass, Tim Marsh on drums, Bob Villareal on guitar and backing vocals, and Karen Voegtlin on keyboards and backing vocals. Other alternating band members between 1978 and 1986 included Billy Blackwood (cousin of Terry Blackwood) on drums, John Mays on bass, Mark Hughes on bass (later with Dobie Gray and owner the world's largest used music store, Mr Mark's Music in Nashville (1980–90, 2000-2016-current), Jeff Chambers on guitars, Randy Dennis on keyboards, David Ennis (later with country group Restless Heart) on keyboards, Gerritt Wilson on Synths, David Hassell on keyboards and vocals, Mark Burchfield on bass. David Hassell also worked as office manager and tour manager for the group. The group's final performance came in June 1986 at Six Flags theme park in Chicago, IL. 

At the time the two had left the Imperials, it was one of the most commercially successful acts in CCM. While not songwriters themselves, Andrus and Blackwood were good judges of what CCM radio wanted, developing relationships with Bruce Hibbard, Hadley Hockensmith, Phil Johnson and Tim Sheppard among others. It paid off with a top 10 title track to their 1979 sophomore double-album Following You. During the group's tenure, they placed eight hits on the Christian radio charts including 3 No. 1 hits, ""Jesus, You're So Wonderful"" (20 weeks,1980-1981).,""Soldier of the Light"" (23 weeks,1981). and ""Step Out of the Night"" (4 weeks,1983). The group appeared as headliners for every major Christian music festival during the late 1970s to mid-1980s, including Disney's Night of Joy, They also appeared on PBS's Austin City Limits musical TV program in 1983. 

Andrus and Blackwood now occasionally perform in group now called ""Elvis' Imperials"" with another former Imperials member, Joe Moscheo."

Edell has been a songwriter/composer for over two decades and toured the US between 1978 and 1983, performing her music. Her debut on the Michigan stage was in 1977, oddly enough the same year that she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Since that time, Edell has gone from being athletic, able bodied, and outspoken to being self assured, spiritual, and even more outspoken. She is still in love with her partner of 15 years and still cares as much about child abuse, self abuse, and alcoholism as she did when she sang ""Emma,"" in 1975.
