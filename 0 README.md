# **What the Rock?**

![](images/00-header.jpg)

This is the **final project** of the 6-month presential **Data Analytics bootcamp** of Ironhack in Barcelona, from September 2024 until March 2025.

I had total freedom to do whatever I wanted with any topic, so I chose music, more specifically **Rock music**, the style I like the most, to analyze and get some interesting and surprising statistics.

Here's the link to the **Streamlit app** with all the visualizations and workflow.

All the code used in the project can be found in the notebooks and in the Streamlit app, in the tab 'Code behind the project'.
